{"context": "These are the financial statements for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (the Company or ANZ) for the year ended 30 September 2019. The Company is incorporated and domiciled in Australia. The address of the Company’s registered office and its principal place of business is ANZ Centre, 833 Collins Street, Docklands, Victoria, Australia 3008."}
{"context": "On 30 October 2019, the Directors resolved to authorise the issue of these financial statements."}
{"context": "Information in the financial statements is included only to the extent we consider it material and relevant to the understanding of the financial statements. A disclosure is considered material and relevant if, for example:"}

{"context": "the user cannot understand the Company’s results without the specific disclosure (qualitative factor);"}

{"context": "the information relates to an aspect of the Company’s operations that is important to its future performance (qualitative factor) and;"}
{"context": "the information is required under legislative requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, the Banking Act 1959 (Cth) or by the Company’s principal regulators, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)."}
{"context": "This section of the financial statements:"}
{"context": "outlines the basis upon which the Company’s financial statements have been prepared; and"}
{"context": "discusses any new accounting standards or regulations that directly impact the financial statements."}
{"context": "BASIS OF PREPARATION"}
{"context": "This financial report is a general purpose (Tier 1) financial report (as defined under the Corporations law) prepared by a ‘for profit’ entity, in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards (AASs) and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) the Corporations Act 2001, and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)."}
{"context": "The Company is a reporting entity under the Corporations Act 2001, and is not exempt from preparing consolidated financial statements. The financial statements for the Company have been prepared for the purpose of the Company fulfilling its financial reporting obligations under part 7.8 of the Corporations Act 2001, as required for Australian Financial Services Licensees."}
{"context": "The Company is the ultimate parent entity of the ANZ Group. The Company consists of the following operations undertaken in Australia and in its overseas branches:"}
{"context": "Retail and Commercial operations,"}
{"context": "Institutional operations, and"}
{"context": "Technology Services & Operations and Group Centre operations"}
{"context": "The consolidated financial statements of the Group can be found as part of the 2019 Annual Report at https//shareholder.anz.com/annual-report- shareholder-review and copies are available from the Company’s registered office and principal place of business."}
{"context": "We present these financial statements in Australian dollars, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. We have rounded values to the nearest million dollars ($m), unless otherwise stated, as allowed under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors Report) Instrument 2016/191."}
{"context": "BASIS OF MEASUREMENT"}
{"context": "We have prepared the financial information in accordance with the historical cost basis - except the following assets and liabilities which we have stated at their fair value:"}
{"context": "derivative financial instruments and in the case of fair value hedging, a fair value adjustment is made on the underlying hedging exposure;"}

{"context": "1. ABOUT THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)"}
{"context": "FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION"}
{"context": "TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES Foreign currency transactions are translated into the relevant functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Australian dollars, being the functional currency, at the relevant spot rate. Any foreign currency translation gains or losses are included in profit or loss in the period they arise."}
{"context": "We measure translation differences on non-monetary items at fair value through profit or loss and report them as part of the fair value gain or loss on these items. We include any translation differences on non-monetary items classified as investment securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (applicable from 1 October 2018) and non-monetary items classified as available-for-sale financial assets in the available-for- sale revaluation reserve in equity (applicable prior to 1 October 2018)."}
{"context": "KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES"}
{"context": "When applying accounting policies, management has made a number of judgements and applied estimates and assumptions about past and future events. Further information on the key judgements and estimates that we consider material to the financial statements are contained within the relevant notes to the financial statements."}
{"context": "ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED IN THE PERIOD"}
{"context": "AASB 9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (AASB 9)"}
{"context": "The Company has applied AASB 9 effective from 1 October 2018 (with the exception of the ‘own credit’ requirements relating to financial liabilities designated as measured at fair value, which were early adopted by the Company effective from 1 October 2013). In addition, the Company chose to early adopt AASB 2017-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (AASB 2017-6) effective from 1 October 2018. AASB 9 provides an accounting policy choice, which the Company has taken in the current period, to continue to apply the AASB 139 hedge accounting requirements until the International Accounting Standards Board’s ongoing project on macro hedge accounting is completed."}
{"context": "AASB 9 and AASB 2017-6 stipulate new requirements for the impairment of financial assets, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and general hedge accounting. Details of the key requirements are outlined within the Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities sections in following notes, and a reconciliation of the transitional impact of adopting the standard at 1 October 2018 is set out in Note 31."}
{"context": "AASB 15 REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (AASB 15)"}
{"context": "The Company adopted AASB 15 from 1 October 2018 which resulted in changes in accounting policies. The standard requires identification of distinct performance obligations within a contract, and allocation of the transaction price of the contract to those performance obligations. Revenue is then recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied. The standard also provides guidance on whether an entity is acting as a principal or an agent which impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis. In accordance with the transitional provisions of AASB 15, the Company has adopted the full retrospective transition approach. Under this approach, the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard has been recognised as an adjustment to opening retained earnings as at 1 October 2017 and comparative information for the 2018 reporting period has been restated."}
{"context": "The adoption of AASB 15 resulted in the following changes in accounting policy:"}
{"context": "Recognition of trail commission revenue: trail commission revenue previously recognised over time is now recognised at the time the Company initially distributes the underlying product to the customer where it is highly probable the revenue will not need to be reversed in future periods."}
{"context": "This policy change resulted in an increase to the opening balances of Other assets $32 million, Deferred tax liabilities $10 million and Retained earnings $22 million as at 1 October 2017 to recognise revenue that qualifies for upfront recognition under AASB 15 but was not previously recognised under AASB 118 Revenue (AASB 118). The change did not impact net profit or earnings per share in the comparative periods."}
{"context": "Presentation: Certain credit card loyalty costs and other costs will be presented as operating expenses where the Company has assessed that it is acting as principal (rather than an agent). Previously these costs were presented as a reduction of other operating income. In addition, certain incentives received from card scheme providers related to card marketing activities will be presented as operating income where the Company has assessed that it is acting as principal (rather than an agent). Previously these incentives were presented as a reduction of operating expenses. The presentation of these costs under AASB 15 increased other operating income and operating expenses by $146 million in 2018. The changes did not impact net profit or earnings per share in the comparative periods."}

{"context": "1. ABOUT THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)"}
{"context": "ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT EARLY ADOPTED"}
{"context": "A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been published but are not mandatory for the financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2019, and have not been applied by the Company in preparing these financial statements. Further details of these are set out below."}
{"context": "GENERAL HEDGE ACCOUNTING"}
{"context": "AASB 9 introduces new hedge accounting requirements which more closely align accounting with risk management activities undertaken when hedging financial and non-financial risks."}
{"context": "AASB 9 provides the Company with an accounting policy choice to continue to apply the AASB 139 hedge accounting requirements until the International Accounting Standards Board’s ongoing project on macro hedge accounting is completed. The Company currently applies the hedge accounting requirements of AASB 139."}
{"context": "AASB 16 LEASES (AASB 16)"}
{"context": "AASB 16 is effective for the Company from 1 October 2019 and replaces the previous standard AASB 117 Leases (AASB 117). AASB 16 primarily impacts the Company’s property and technology leases which were previously classified as operating leases. Under AASB 117, operating leases were not recognised on balance sheet and rent payments were expensed over the lease term."}
{"context": "Under AASB 16, lessees must recognise all leases (except for lease of low value assets and short term leases) on balance sheet under a single accounting model. Accordingly, the Company will recognise its right to use an underlying leased asset over the lease term as a right-of-use (ROU) asset, and its obligation to make lease payments as a lease liability. In the income statement, the Company will recognise depreciation expense on the ROU asset and interest expense on the lease liability. As a result, lease expenses will be higher in the early periods of a lease and lower in the later periods of the lease compared to the previous standard where expenses were constant over the lease term. Cumulative expenses over the life of a lease will not change."}
{"context": "The Company will apply the modified retrospective transition approach whereby initial lease liabilities are recognised based on the present value of remaining lease payments as of the transition date. The initial ROU asset recognised for certain large commercial and retail leases will be measured as if AASB 16 had always been applied to the leases. For all other leases, the initial ROU asset will be measured as equal to the initial lease liability. Based on this transition approach, the Company expects to recognise an increase in liabilities of $2.2 billion and an increase in assets of $2.1 billion. This is expected to result in a reduction to opening retained earnings of $66 million and an increase in deferred tax assets of $37 million as of 1 October 2019. Comparative information from prior periods will not be restated."}
{"context": "The implementation of AASB 16 requires management to make certain key judgements including the determination of lease terms, discount rates and identifying arrangements that contain a lease. These estimates may be refined as the Company finalises its implementation of the standard in the first half of the 2020 financial year."}
{"context": "AASB 17 INSURANCE CONTRACTS (AASB 17)"}
{"context": "The final version of AASB 17 was issued in July 2017 and is not effective for the Company until 1 October 2021. It will replace AASB 4 Insurance Contracts, AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts and AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts. AASB 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts."}
{"context": "The measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements under AASB 17 are significantly different from current accounting standards. Although the overall profit recognised in respect of insurance contracts will not change, it is expected that the timing of profit recognition will change."}
{"context": "The impact of AASB 17 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company."}
{"context": "AASB INTERPRETATION 23 UNCERTAINTY OVER INCOME TAX TREATMENTS (INTERPRETATION 23)"}
{"context": "In July 2017 the AASB issued Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments. The Interpretation clarifies application of recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12 Income Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments."}
{"context": "Interpretation 23 will apply to the Company from 1 October 2019, and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company."}
{"context": "REVISED CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK"}
{"context": "In June 2019 the AASB issued a revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting. The new Framework includes updated definitions and criteria for the recognition and derecognition of assets and liabilities. Additionally it introduces new concepts on measurement, including factors to consider when selecting a measurement basis. The revised Conceptual Framework will apply to the Company from 1 October 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company."}

{"context": "INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK REFORM"}
{"context": "Interbank offered rates (IBORs), such as LIBOR, are a key reference rate for derivatives, loans and securities for global financial markets. In response to concerns about the transparency and liquidity of IBOR rates, regulators in a number of jurisdictions across the globe are well advanced in developing benchmark rates to phase out and replace IBORs, these projects are collectively known as ‘IBOR Reform’. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is also considering the financial reporting implications of IBOR reform which is expected to impact elements of financial instrument accounting, including hedge accounting, loan modifications, fair value methodologies and disclosures."}
{"context": "The IASB project is split into two phases: Phase 1 deals with pre-replacement issues (issues affecting financial reporting in the period before the replacement of IBOR’s); and Phase 2 deals with replacement issues (issues affecting financial reporting when existing IBOR’s are replaced)."}
{"context": "In September 2019, the IASB issued a final standard, Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 which focuses on ‘pre-rate replacement issues’ and provides exceptions to specific hedge accounting requirements under IAS 39 and IFRS 9 so that entities will be able to apply those hedge accounting requirements under an assumption that the interest rate benchmark is not altered as a result of the interest rate benchmark reform. In October 2019, AASB adopted these amendments in AASB 2019-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform."}
{"context": "Although the Company anticipates the new standard, once adopted, will provide certain relief in relation to hedge accounting requirements, for 30 September 2019 reporting purposes, it has considered the existing portfolio of hedge accounted relationships in light of:"}
{"context": "the significant uncertainty surrounding the method and timing of transition away from IBORs; and"}
{"context": "ongoing application and reliance in capital markets on IBOR’s for financial instrument pricing."}
{"context": "As result of the above factors, the Company has concluded that continuation of hedge accounting relationships for potentially impacted hedge relationship remains appropriate."}
{"context": "The Company is considering the new standard which is effective on 1 October 2020 but may be adopted earlier."}

{"context": "NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"}
{"context": "2. OPERATING INCOME (continued)"}
{"context": "RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT"}
{"context": "NET INTEREST INCOME Interest Income and Expense We recognise interest income and expense for all financial instruments, including those classified as held for trading, assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (applicable from 1 October 2018), available-for-sale assets (applicable prior to 1 October 2018) or designated at fair value, through profit or loss in net interest income. For assets held at amortised cost, the Company uses the effective interest rate method to calculate amortised cost. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the stream of estimated future cash receipts or payments over the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. For assets subject to prepayment, we determine their expected life on the basis of historical behaviour of the particular asset portfolio - taking into account contractual obligations and prepayment experience."}
{"context": "We recognise fees and costs, which form an integral part of the financial instrument (for example loan origination fees and costs), using the effective interest method. This is presented as part of interest income or expense depending on whether the underlying financial instrument is a financial asset or financial liability."}
{"context": "Major Bank Levy The Major Bank Levy Act 2017 (‘Levy’ or ‘Major bank levy’) applies a rate of 0.06% to certain liabilities of the Company. The Company has determined that the levy represents a finance cost for the Company and $363 million (2018: $355 million) is presented in interest expense in the Income Statement."}
{"context": "OTHER OPERATING INCOME Fee and Commission Revenue We recognise fee and commission revenue arising from contracts with customers: (a) over time when the performance obligation is satisfied across more than one reporting period or (b) at a point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied immediately or is satisfied within one reporting period."}
{"context": "Lending fees exclude fees treated as part of the effective yield calculation of interest income. Lending fees include certain guarantee and commitment fees where the loan or guarantee is not likely to be drawn upon and other fees charged for providing customers a distinct good or service that are recognised separately from the underlying lending product (including annual package fees that provide benefits on other ANZ products)."}
{"context": "Non lending fees includes fees associated with deposit and credit card accounts, interchange fees and fees charged for specific customer transactions such as international money transfers. Where the Company provides multiple goods or services to a customer under the same contract, the Company allocates the transaction price of the contract to those performance obligations based on the relative stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation. Revenue is recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied."}
{"context": "Commissions represent fees from third parties where ANZ acts as an agent by arranging a third party (e.g. an insurance provider) to provide goods and services to a customer. In such cases, ANZ is not primarily responsible for providing the underlying good or service to the customer. If the Company collects funds on behalf of a third party when acting as an agent, the Company only recognises the net commission it retains as revenue. When the commission is variable based on factors outside the control of the Company (e.g. a trail commission), revenue is only recognised if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of the variable amount will not be required in future periods."}
{"context": "Funds management income represent fees earned from customers for providing financial advice and fees for asset management services and advice provided to investment funds. Revenue is recognised either at the point the financial advice is provided or over the period in which the asset management services are delivered. Performance fees associated with funds management activities are only recognised when it becomes highly probable the performance hurdle will be achieved."}
{"context": "Net Foreign Exchange Earnings and Other Financial Instruments Income We recognise the following as net foreign exchange earnings and other financial instruments income:"}
{"context": "exchange rate differences arising on the settlement of monetary items and translation differences on monetary items translated at rates different to those at which they were initially recognised or included in a previous financial report;"}

{"context": "Personnel expenses also include share-based payments which may be cash or equity settled. We calculate the fair value of equity settled remuneration at grant date, which is then amortised over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in share capital or the share option reserve as applicable. When we estimate the fair value, we take into account market vesting conditions, such as share price performance conditions. We take non-market vesting conditions, such as service conditions, into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the expense."}
{"context": "After the grant of an equity-based award, the amount we recognise as an expense is reversed when non-market vesting conditions are not met, for example an employee fails to satisfy the minimum service period specified in the award on resignation, termination or notice of dismissal for serious misconduct.

{"context": "Financial assets - general"}
{"context": "There are three measurement classifications for financial assets under AASB 9: amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Financial assets are classified into these measurement classifications on the basis of two criteria:"}
{"context": "the business model within which the financial asset is managed; and  the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset (specifically whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest)."}
{"context": "The resultant financial asset classifications are as follows:"}
{"context": "Amortised cost: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest only and which are held in a business model whose objective is to collect their cash flows;"}
{"context": "FVOCI: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest only and which are held in a business model whose objective is to collect their cash flows or to sell the assets; and"}
{"context": "FVTPL: Any other financial assets not falling into the categories above are measured at FVTPL."}
{"context": "Fair Value Option for Financial Assets"}
{"context": "A financial asset may be irrevocably designated FVTPL on initial recognition when the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise."}

{"context": "The Company’s derivative financial instruments have been categorised as following:"}
{"context": "Trading"}
{"context": "Derivatives held in order to:"}
{"context": "Meet customer needs for managing their own risks.  Manage risks in the Company that are not in a designated hedge accounting relationship (balance sheet management)."}

{"context": "TYPES"}
{"context": "The Company offers and uses four different types of derivative financial instruments:"}
{"context": "Forwards"}
{"context": "A contract documenting the rate of interest, or the currency exchange rate, to be paid or received on a notional principal obligation at a future date."}
{"context": "Futures"}
{"context": "An exchange traded contract in which the parties agree to buy or sell an asset in the future for a price agreed on the transaction date, with a net settlement in cash paid on the future date without physical delivery of the asset."}
{"context": "Swaps"}
{"context": "A contract in which two parties exchange a series of cash flows for another."}
{"context": "Options"}
{"context": "A contract in which the buyer of the contract has the right - but not the obligation - to buy (known as a “call option”) or to sell (known as a “put option”) an asset or instrument at a set price on a future date. The seller has the corresponding obligation to fulfil the transaction to sell or buy the asset or instrument if the buyer exercises the option."}

{"context": "Objective of this hedging arrangement"}
{"context": "To hedge our exposure to changes to the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or unrecognised firm commitment caused by interest rate or foreign currency movements."}

{"context": "Recognition"}
{"context": "Initially and at each reporting date, we recognise all derivatives at fair value. If the fair value of a derivative is positive, then we carry it as an asset, but if its value is negative, then we carry it as a liability."}
{"context": "Valuation adjustments are integral in determining the fair value of derivatives. This includes:"}
{"context": ""}
{"context": "a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) to reflect the counterparty risk and/or event of default; and a funding valuation adjustment (FVA) to account for funding costs and benefits in the derivatives portfolio."}
{"context": "Derecognition of assets and liabilities"}
{"context": "We remove derivative assets from our balance sheet when the contracts expire or we have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. We remove derivative liabilities from our balance sheet when the Company’s contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired."}
{"context": "Impact on the Income Statement"}
{"context": "How we recognise gains or losses on derivative financial instruments depends on whether the derivative is held for trading or is designated into a hedging relationship. For derivative financial instruments held for trading, gains or losses from changes in the fair value are recognised in profit or loss."}
{"context": "For an instrument designated into a hedging relationship the recognition of gains or losses depends on the nature of the item being hedged. Refer to the table on page 24 for profit or loss treatment depending on the hedge type."}
{"context": "Sources of hedge ineffectiveness may arise from basis risk and differences in discounting between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The hedging instruments are discounted using Overnight Index Swaps discount curves which are not applied to the hedged items."}
{"context": "Hedge effectiveness"}
{"context": "To qualify for hedge accounting a hedge is expected to be highly effective. A hedge is highly effective only if the following conditions are met:"}
{"context": "the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the period for which the hedge is designated (prospective effectiveness); and the actual results of the hedge are within the range of 80-125% (retrospective effectiveness)."}

{"context": "RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT"}
{"context": "Policy applicable from 1 October 2018"}
{"context": "EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS IMPAIRMENT MODEL"}
{"context": "The measurement of expected credit losses reflects an unbiased, probability weighted prediction which evaluates a range of scenarios and takes into account the time value of money, past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions."}
{"context": "Expected credit losses are either measured over 12 months or the expected lifetime of the financial asset, depending on credit deterioration since origination, according to the following three-stage approach:"}
{"context": "Stage 1: At the origination of a financial asset, and where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, an allowance equivalent to 12 months ECL is recognised reflecting the expected credit losses resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months from the reporting date. For instruments with a remaining maturity of less than 12 months, expected credit losses are estimated based on default events that are possible over the remaining time to maturity."}
{"context": "Stage 2: Where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised reflecting expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. If credit risk were to improve in a subsequent period such that the increase in credit risk since origination is no longer considered significant, the exposure returns to a Stage 1 classification and a 12 month ECL applies."}
{"context": "Stage 3: Where there is objective evidence of impairment, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised."}
{"context": "Expected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for exposures in Stage 1 and Stage 2, and on either a collective or individual basis when transferred to Stage 3."}
{"context": "MEASUREMENT OF EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS"}
{"context": "ECL is calculated as the product of the following credit risk factors at a facility level, discounted to incorporate the time value of money:"}
{"context": "Probability of default (PD) - the estimate of the likelihood that a borrower will default over a given period;"}
{"context": "Exposure at default (EAD) - the expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and interest, expected additional drawdowns and accrued interest; and"}
{"context": "Loss given default (LGD) - the expected loss in the event of the borrower defaulting, expressed as a percentage of the facility's EAD, taking into account direct and indirect recovery costs."}
{"context": "These credit risk factors are adjusted for current and forward looking information through the use of macro-economic variables."}
{"context": "EXPECTED LIFE"}
{"context": "When estimating ECL for exposures in Stage 2 and 3, the Company considers the expected lifetime over which it is exposed to credit risk."}
{"context": "For non-retail portfolios, the Company uses the maximum contractual period as the expected lifetime for non-revolving credit facilities. For non-retail revolving credit facilities, such as corporate lines of credit, the expected life reflects the Company’s contractual right to withdraw a facility as part of a contractually agreed annual review, after taking into account the applicable notice period."}
{"context": "For retail portfolios, the expected lifetime is determined using behavioural term, taking into account expected prepayment behaviour and substantial modifications."}
{"context": "DEFINITION OF DEFAULT, CREDIT IMPAIRED AND WRITE-OFFS"}
{"context": "The definition of default used in measuring expected credit losses is aligned to the definition used for internal credit risk management purposes across all portfolios. This definition is also in line with the regulatory definition of default. Default occurs when there are indicators that a debtor is unlikely to fully satisfy contractual credit obligations to the Company, or the exposure is 90 days past due."}
{"context": "Financial assets, including those that are well secured, are considered credit impaired for financial reporting purposes when they default."}
{"context": "When there is no realistic probability of recovery, loans are written off against the related impairment allowance on completion of the Company’s internal processes and when all reasonably expected recoveries have been collected. In subsequent periods, any recoveries of amounts previously written-off are credited to credit impairment charge in the income statement."}

{"context": "12. ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)"}
{"context": "RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT"}
{"context": "MODIFIED FINANCIAL ASSETS"}
{"context": "If the terms of a financial asset are modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one for either credit or commercial reasons, an assessment is made to determine if the changes to the terms of the existing financial asset are considered substantial. This assessment considers both changes in cash flows arising from the modified terms as well as changes in the overall instrument risk profile; for example, changes in the principal (credit limit), term, or type of underlying collateral. Where a modification is considered non-substantial, the existing financial asset is not derecognised and its date of origination continues to be used to determine SICR. Where a modification is considered substantial, the existing financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at its fair value on the modification date, which also becomes the date of origination used to determine SICR for this new asset."}
{"context": "SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CREDIT RISK (SICR)"}
{"context": "Stage 2 assets are those that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination. In determining what constitutes a SICR, the Company considers both qualitative and quantitative information:"}
{"context": "i."}
{"context": "Internal credit rating grade"}
{"context": "For the majority of portfolios, the primary indicator of a SICR is a significant deterioration in the internal credit rating grade of a facility since origination and is measured by application of thresholds."}
{"context": "For non-retail portfolios, a SICR is determined by comparing the Customer Credit Rating (CCR) applicable to a facility at reporting date to the CCR at origination of that facility. A CCR is assigned to each borrower which reflects the probability of default of the borrower and incorporates both borrower and non-borrower specific information, including forward looking information. CCRs are subject to review at least annually or more frequently when an event occurs which could affect the credit risk of the customer."}
{"context": "For retail portfolios, a SICR is determined by comparing each facility’s scenario weighted lifetime probability of default at the reporting date to the scenario weighted lifetime probability of default at origination. The scenario weighted lifetime probability of default may increase significantly if:"}
{"context": "there has been a deterioration in the economic outlook, or an increase in economic uncertainty; or"}
{"context": "there has been a deterioration in the customer’s overall credit position, or ability to manage their credit obligations."}
{"context": "ii. Backstop criteria"}
{"context": "The Company uses 30 days past due arrears as a backstop criteria for both non-retail and retail portfolios. For retail portfolios only, facilities are required to demonstrate three to six months of good payment behaviour prior to being allocated back to Stage 1."}
{"context": "FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION"}
{"context": "Forward-looking information is incorporated into both our assessment of whether a financial asset has experienced a significant increase in credit risk since its initial recognition and in our estimate of ECL. In applying forward looking information for estimating ECL, the Company considers four probability-weighted forecast economic scenarios as follows:"}
{"context": "i. Base case scenario"}
{"context": "The base case scenario is ANZ’s view of the most likely future macro-economic conditions. It reflects management’s assumptions used for strategic planning and budgeting, and also informs ANZ’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) which is the process ANZ applies in strategic and capital planning over a 3 year time horizon;"}
{"context": "ii. Upside and iii. Downside scenarios"}
{"context": "The upside and downside scenarios are fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions (that is, they are not based on the economic conditions prevailing at balance date) and are based on a combination of more optimistic (in the case of the upside) and pessimistic (in the case of the downside) economic events and uncertainty over long term horizons; and"}
{"context": "iv. Severe downside scenario"}
{"context": "The severe downside scenario is fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions and accounts for the potentially severe impact of less likely extremely adverse economic conditions. It reflects macro-economic conditions of a downturn economic event with a probability of occurrence once every 25 years."}
{"context": "The four scenarios are described in terms of macro-economic variables used in the PD, LGD and EAD models (collectively the ECL models) depending on the portfolio and country of the borrower. Examples of the variables include unemployment rates, GDP growth rates, house price indices, commercial property price indices and consumer price indices."}

{"context": "The Company recognises two types of impairment provisions for its loans and advances:"}

{"context": "Collective provisions for portfolios of similar assets that are assessed collectively for impairment."}
{"context": "The accounting treatment for each of them is detailed below:"}
{"context": "Individually"}
{"context": "Collectively"}
{"context": "Assessment"}
{"context": "If any impaired loans and advances exceed specified thresholds and an impairment event has been identified, then we assess the need for a provision individually."}
{"context": "To allow for any small value loans and advances where losses may have been incurred but not yet identified, and individually significant loans and advances that we do not assess as impaired, we assess them collectively in pools of assets with similar credit risk characteristics."}
{"context": "Impairment"}
{"context": "Loans and advances are assessed as impaired if we have objective evidence that we may not recover principal or interest payments (that is, a loss event has been incurred)."}
{"context": "We estimate the provision on the basis of historical loss experience for assets with similar credit risk characteristics to others in the respective collective pool. We adjust the historical loss experience based on current observable data – such as: changing economic conditions, the impact of the inherent risk of large concentrated losses within the portfolio and an assessment of the economic cycle."}
{"context": "Measurement"}
{"context": "We measure impairment loss as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and estimated future cash flows discounted to their present value at the asset’s original effective interest rate. We record the result as an expense in profit or loss in the period we identify the impairment and recognise a corresponding reduction in the carrying amount of loans and advances through an offsetting provision."}
{"context": "Uncollectable amounts"}
{"context": "If a loan or advance is uncollectable (whether partially or in full), then we write off the balance (and also any related provision for credit impairment). We write off unsecured retail facilities at the earlier of the facility becoming 180 days past due, or the customer’s bankruptcy or similar legal release from the obligation to repay the loan or advance. For secured facilities, write offs occur net of the proceeds determined to be recoverable from the realisation of collateral."}
{"context": "Recoveries"}
{"context": "If we recover any cash flows from loans and advances we have previously written off, then we recognise the recovery in profit or loss in the period the cash flows are received."}

{"context": "KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES"}
{"context": "Applicable from 1 October 2018"}
{"context": "When estimating the allowance for expected credit losses for loans and advances, we used management’s judgement in respect of the"}
{"context": "matters outlined below."}
{"context": "Key Judgements"}
{"context": "Determining when a significant increase in credit risk has occurred"}
{"context": "In the measurement of ECL, judgement is involved in setting the rules to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition of a loan, resulting in the financial asset moving from ‘stage 1’ to ‘stage 2’. This is a key area of judgement as transition from stage 1 to stage 2 increases the ECL calculation from an allowance based on the probability of default in the next 12 months, to an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses. Subsequent decreases in credit risk combined with transition from stage 2 to stage 1 may similarly result in significant changes in the ECL allowance."}
{"context": "The setting of precise trigger points requires judgement which may have a material impact upon the size of the ECL allowance. The Company monitors the effectiveness of SICR criteria on an ongoing basis."}
{"context": "Measuring both 12-month and lifetime credit losses"}
{"context": "The PD, LGD, and EAD credit risk parameters used in determining ECL are point-in-time measures reflecting the relevant forward looking information determined by management. Judgement is involved in determining which forward-looking information variables are relevant for particular lending portfolios and for determining each portfolio’s point-in-time sensitivity."}
{"context": "In addition, judgement is required where behavioural characteristics are applied in estimating the lifetime of a facility to be used in measuring ECL. All other things being equal, an increase in the expected behavioural life will increase the amount of ECL."}
{"context": "Forecasting forward-looking scenarios"}
{"context": "Our forecast of forward looking information variables is established from a “base case” or most likely scenario that is used internally by management for planning and forecasting purposes."}
{"context": "The expected outcomes of key economic drivers for the base case scenario as at 30 September, 2019 are as follows:"}
{"context": "Australia The unemployment rate is expected to remain essentially flat and GDP growth to improve modestly over the forecast period, with residential property values expected to improve after a period of decline. Commercial property prices are expected to decline slightly through the forecast period. Consumer price index growth is expected to rise from current levels."}
{"context": "Rest of world GDP growth is forecast to taper lower in the near term due to uncertainty in the global outlook. Inflation is also expected to remain soft over the forecast period to 2020."}
{"context": "Probability weighting of each scenario"}
{"context": "Probability weighting of each scenario is determined by management considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the base case scenario, as well as specific portfolio considerations where required."}
{"context": "Management temporary adjustments"}
{"context": "Management temporary adjustments to the ECL allowance are adjustments we use in circumstances where we judge that our existing inputs, assumptions and model techniques do not capture all the risk factors relevant to our lending portfolios. Emerging local or global macroeconomic, microeconomic or political events, and natural disasters that are not incorporated into our current parameters, risk ratings, or forward-looking information are examples of such circumstances."}

{"context": "CREDIT RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES Granting credit facilities to customers is one of the Company’s major sources of income. As this activity is also a principal risk, the Company dedicates considerable resources to its management. The Company assumes credit risk in a wide range of lending and other activities in diverse markets and in many jurisdictions. Credit risks arise from traditional lending to customers as well as from inter-bank, treasury, trade finance and capital markets activities around the world."}

{"context": "CREDIT RISK (continued)"}
{"context": "We quantify credit risk through an internal credit rating system (masterscales) to ensure consistency across exposure types and to provide a consistent framework for reporting and analysis. The system uses models and other tools to measure the following for customer exposures:"}
{"context": "Probability of Default (PD)"}

{"context": "Loss Given Default (LGD)"}
{"context": "Expressed by a Security Indicator (SI) ranging from A to G. The SI is calculated by reference to the percentage of loan covered by security which the Company can realise if a customer defaults. The A-G scale is supplemented by a range of other SIs which cover factors such as cash cover and sovereign backing. For retail and some small business customers, we group exposures into large homogenous pools – and the LGD is assigned at the pool level."}
{"context": "Our specialist credit risk teams develop and validate the Company’s PD and LGD rating models. The outputs from these models drive our day-to-day credit risk management decisions including origination, pricing, approval levels, regulatory capital adequacy, economic capital allocation, and credit provisioning."}
{"context": "All customers with whom the Company has a credit relationship are assigned a CCR at origination via either of the following assessment approaches:"}
{"context": "Large and more complex lending"}
{"context": "Retail and some small business lending"}

{"context": "CREDIT RISK (continued)"}
{"context": "COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT We use collateral for on and off-balance sheet exposures to mitigate credit risk if a counterparty cannot meet its repayment obligations from its expected cash flows. Where there is sufficient collateral, an expected credit loss is not recognised. This is largely the case for certain lending products that are secured by corresponding investment for which the margin loans are utilised and for reverse repurchase agreements. For some products, the collateral provided by customers is fundamental to the product’s structuring, so it is not strictly the secondary source of repayment - for example, lending secured by trade receivables is typically repaid by the collection of those receivables. During the period there was no change in our collateral policies."}
{"context": "The nature of collateral or security held for the relevant classes of financial assets is as follows:"}
{"context": "Net loans and advances"}
{"context": "Loans - housing and personal"}
{"context": "Housing loans are secured by mortgage(s) over property and additional security may take the form of guarantees and deposits."}
{"context": "Personal lending (including credit cards and overdrafts) is predominantly unsecured. If we take security, then it is restricted to eligible vehicles, motor homes and other assets."}
{"context": "Loans - business"}
{"context": "Business loans may be secured, partially secured or unsecured. Typically, we take security by way of a mortgage over property and/or a charge over the business or other assets."}
{"context": "If appropriate, we may take other security to mitigate the credit risk, for example: guarantees, standby letters of credit or derivative protection."}
{"context": "Other financial assets"}
{"context": "Trading securities, Investment securities (from 1 October 2018), Available- for-sale assets (prior to 1 October 2018), Derivatives and Other financial assets"}
{"context": "For trading securities, we do not seek collateral directly from the issuer or counterparty. However, the collateral may be implicit in the terms of the instrument (for example, with an asset-backed security). The terms of debt securities may include collateralisation."}
{"context": "For derivatives, we typically terminate all contracts with the counterparty and settle on a net basis at market levels current at the time of a counterparty default under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreements."}
{"context": "Our preferred practice is to use a Credit Support Annex (CSA) to the ISDA so that open derivative positions with the counterparty are aggregated and cash collateral (or other forms of eligible collateral) is exchanged daily. The collateral is provided by the counterparty when their position is out of the money (or provided to the counterparty by the Company when our position is out of the money)."}
{"context": "Off-balance sheet positions"}
{"context": "Undrawn and contingent facilities."}
{"context": "Collateral for off balance sheet positions is mainly held against undrawn facilities, and they are typically performance bonds or guarantees. Undrawn facilities that are secured include housing loans secured by mortgages over residential property and business lending secured by commercial real estate and/or charges over business assets."}

{"context": "The BRC delegates responsibility for day-to-day management of both market risks and compliance with market risk policies to the Credit & Market Risk Committee (CMRC) and the Group Asset & Liability Committee (GALCO)."}
{"context": "Within overall strategies and policies established by the BRC, business units and risk management have joint responsibility for the control of market risk at the Company level. The Market Risk team (a specialist risk management unit independent of the business) allocates market risk limits at various levels and monitors and reports on them daily. This detailed framework allocates individual limits to manage and control exposures using risk factors and profit and loss limits."}
{"context": "Management, measurement and reporting of market risk is undertaken in two broad categories:"}
{"context": "Traded Market Risk"}
{"context": "Non-Traded Market Risk"}
{"context": "Risk of loss from changes in the value of financial instruments due to movements in price factors for both physical and derivative trading positions. Principal risk categories monitored are:"}
{"context": "1. Currency risk – potential loss arising from changes in foreign exchange rates or their implied volatilities."}
{"context": "2. Interest rate risk – potential loss from changes in market interest rates or their implied volatilities."}
{"context": "Risk of loss associated with the management of non-traded interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange exposures. This includes interest rate risk in the banking book. This risk of loss arises from adverse changes in the overall and relative level of interest rates for different tenors, differences in the actual versus expected net interest margin, and the potential valuation risk associated with embedded options in financial instruments and bank products."}
{"context": "3. Credit spread risk – potential loss arising from a movement in margin or spread relative to a benchmark."}
{"context": "4. Commodity risk – potential loss arising from changes in commodity prices or their implied volatilities."}
{"context": "5. Equity risk – potential loss arising from changes in equity prices."}
{"context": "MEASUREMENT OF MARKET RISK We primarily manage and control market risk using Value at Risk (VaR), sensitivity analysis and stress testing."}
{"context": "VaR gauges the Company’s possible daily loss based on historical market movements."}
{"context": "The Company’s VaR approach for both traded and non-traded risk is historical simulation. We use historical changes in market rates, prices and volatilities over:"}
{"context": "the previous 500 business days, to calculate standard VaR; and"}
{"context": "a 1-year stressed period, to calculate stressed VaR."}
{"context": "We calculate traded and non-traded VaR using one-day and ten-day holding periods. For stressed VaR, we use a ten-day period. Back testing is used to ensure our VaR models remain accurate."}

{"context": "Balance sheet risk management The principal objectives of balance sheet risk management are to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk to mitigate the negative impact of movements in interest rates on the earnings and market value of the Company’s banking book, while ensuring the Company maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations as they fall due."}
{"context": "Interest rate risk management Non-traded interest rate risk relates to the potential adverse impact of changes in market interest rates on the Company’s future net interest income. This risk arises from two principal sources, namely mismatches between the repricing dates of interest bearing assets and liabilities; and the investment of capital and other non-interest bearing liabilities in interest bearing assets. Interest rate risk is reported using VaR and scenario analysis (based on the impact of a 1% rate shock). The table below shows VaR figures for non-traded interest rate risk for the combined Company as well as Australia, New Zealand and Asia Pacific, Europe and Americas (APEA) geographies which are calculated separately."}

{"context": "Bank of Tianjin (BoT) The valuation of the BoT investment is sensitive to the selected unobservable input, being the P/B multiple.

{"context": "The majority of valuation models the Company uses employ only observable market data as inputs. However, for certain financial instruments, we may use data that is not readily observable in current markets. If we use unobservable market data, then we need to exercise more judgement to determine fair value depending on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation. Generally, we derive unobservable inputs from other relevant market data and compare them to observed transaction prices where available."}
{"context": "When establishing the fair value of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, the Company considers valuation adjustments in determining the fair value. We may apply adjustments (such as bid/offer spreads, credit valuation adjustments and funding valuation adjustments – refer Note 9 Derivative Financial Instruments) to the techniques used to reflect the Company’s assessment of factors that market participants would consider in setting fair value."}

{"context": "CAPITAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY"}
{"context": "The Company’s capital management strategy aims to protect the interests of depositors, creditors and shareholders. We achieve this through an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) whereby the Company conducts detailed strategic and capital planning over a 3 year time horizon. The process involves:"}
{"context": "forecasting economic variables, financial performance of the Company’s divisions and the financial impact of new strategic initiatives to be implemented during the planning period;"}
{"context": "performing stress tests under different economic scenarios to determine the level of additional capital (‘stress capital buffer’) needed to absorb losses that may be experienced under an economic downturn;"}
{"context": "reviewing capital ratios and targets across various classes of capital against the Company’s risk profile; and"}
{"context": "developing a capital plan, taking into account capital ratio targets, current and future capital issuances requirements and options around capital products, timing and markets to execute the capital plan under differing market and economic conditions."}
{"context": "The capital plan is approved by the Board and updated as required. The Board and senior management are provided with regular updates of the Company’s capital position. Any material actions required to ensure ongoing prudent capital management are submitted to the Board for approval. Throughout the year, the Company maintained compliance with all the regulatory requirements related to Capital Adequacy in the jurisdictions in which it operates."}
{"context": "REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT"}
{"context": "As ANZ is an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) in Australia, it is regulated by APRA under the Banking Act 1959 (Cth). The Company must comply with the minimum regulatory capital requirements, prudential capital ratios and specific reporting levels that APRA sets and which are consistent with the global Basel III capital framework. This is the common framework for determining the appropriate level of bank regulatory capital as set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)."}
{"context": "For reporting purposes as part of the ANZ 2019 Annual Report, Capital Adequacy Ratios are presented for the Level 2 ADI and are not presented for the Company as a standalone entity.

{"context": "24. TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS"}
{"context": "In the normal course of business the Company enters into transactions where it transfers financial assets directly to third parties or to Structured Entities (SEs). These transfers may give rise to the Company fully, or partially derecognising those financial assets depending on the Company’s exposure to the risks and rewards or control over the transferred assets. If the Company retains substantially all of the risk and rewards of a transferred asset, the transfer does not qualify for derecognition and the asset remains on the Company’s balance sheet in its entirety."}
{"context": "SECURITISATIONS"}
{"context": "Net loans and advances include residential mortgages securitised under the Company’s securitisation programs which are assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs to provide security for obligations payable on the notes issued by the SEs. The holders of the issued notes have full recourse to the pool of residential mortgages which have been securitised and the Company cannot otherwise pledge or dispose of the transferred assets."}
{"context": "In some instances the Company is also the holder of the securitised notes. In addition, the Company is entitled to any residual income of the SEs and sometimes enters into derivatives with the SEs. The Company retains the risks and rewards of the residential mortgages and continues to recognise the mortgages as financial assets. The obligation to pay this amount to the SE is recognised as a financial liability of the Company."}
{"context": "The Company is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with these securitisation SEs and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the SEs activities. The SEs are therefore consolidated by the Company when preparing consolidated Group financial statements."}
{"context": "COVERED BONDS"}
{"context": "The Company operates various global covered bond programs to raise funding in its primary markets. Net loans and advances include residential mortgages assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs associated with these covered bond programs. The mortgages provide security for the obligations payable on the issued covered bonds."}
{"context": "The covered bond holders have dual recourse to the issuer and the cover pool of assets. The issuer cannot otherwise pledge or dispose of the transferred assets, however, subject to legal arrangements it may repurchase and substitute assets as long as the required cover is maintained."}
{"context": "The Company is required to maintain the cover pool at a level sufficient to cover the bond obligations. In addition the Company is entitled to any residual income of the covered bond SEs and enters into derivatives with the SEs. The Company retains the majority of the risks and rewards of the residential mortgages and continues to recognise the mortgages as financial assets. The obligation to pay this amount to the SEs is recognised as a financial liability of the Company."}
{"context": "The Company is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with the covered bond SEs and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the SEs activities. The SEs are therefore consolidated by the Company when preparing consolidated Group financial statements. The covered bonds issued externally are included within debt issuances."}

{"context": "the fair value of the assets and liabilities classified as being held for sale."}
{"context": "Management is required to exercise significant judgement when assessing the fair value less costs to sell for assets and liabilities held for sale. The judgemental factors include determining: costs to sell, allocation of goodwill, indemnities provided under the sale contract and consideration received - particularly where elements of consideration are contingent in nature. Any impairment we record is based on the best available evidence of fair value compared to the carrying value before the impairment. The final sale price may be different to the fair value we estimate when recording the impairment. Management regularly assess the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions against actual outcomes and other relevant evidence and adjustments are made to fair value where appropriate. We expect that the sales will complete within 12 months after balance date, subject to the relevant regulatory approvals and customary terms of sale for such assets."}

These schemes have corporate trustees, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. The trustees are the legal owners of the assets, which are held separately from the assets of the Company and are responsible for setting investment policy and agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the triennial actuarial valuation process."}
{"context": "The defined benefit section of the ANZ Australian Staff Superannuation Scheme and ANZ UK Staff Pension Scheme are the two largest defined benefit plans and have been closed to new members since 1987 and 2004 respectively. These plans did not have a material deficit, or surplus, at the last funding valuations.

{"context": "ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES ($2,921M)"}
{"context": "Refer to the critical accounting estimates and judgements and disclosures in relation to allowance for expected credit losses in Note 12 to the Financial Report."}
{"context": "The Key Audit Matter AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9) was adopted by the Company on 1 October 2018. This is a key audit matter due to the significance of the loans and advances balance to the financial statements and the inherent complexity of the Company’s Expected Credit Loss (ECL) models (ECL models) used to measure ECL allowances. This new and complex accounting standard requires the Company to recognise ECLs on its loans and advances and off-balance sheet positions; the Company developed new models which are reliant on data as well as a number of estimates including the impact of multiple economic scenarios and other assumptions such as defining a significant increase in credit risk (SICR). This involves significant judgement and estimates and takes into account forward looking information reflecting potential future economic events."}
{"context": "AASB 9 requires the Company to measure ECLs on a forward-looking basis reflecting a range of future economic conditions, including key forward- looking assumptions such as forecast GDP and unemployment levels. Post-model adjustments to the ECL results are also made by the Company to address known ECL model limitations or emerging trends in the loan portfolios. We exercise significant judgement in challenging the economic scenarios used and the judgemental overlays the Company applied to the ECL results."}
{"context": "The criteria selected to identify a SICR, such as a decrease in customer credit rating (CCR), are key areas of judgement within the Company’s ECL methodology as these criteria determine if a forward-looking 12 month or lifetime allowance is recorded."}

These specific allowances are established based on the expected future cash repayments and estimated proceeds from the value of the collateral held by the Company in respect of the loans."}
{"context": "How the matter was addressed in our audit Our audit procedures for the allowance for ECL and disclosures for the year ended 30 September 2019 included assessing the Company’s significant accounting policies against the requirements of the accounting standard. Additionally our procedures covered:"}
{"context": "We tested key controls in relation to:"}
{"context": "The Company’s ECL model governance and validation processes;"}
{"context": "The Company’s assessment and approval of the forward looking macroeconomic assumptions and scenario weightings through challenge applied by the Company’s internal governance processes;"}
{"context": "Reconciliation of the data used in the ECL calculation process to gross balances recorded within the general ledger as well as source systems;"}
{"context": "Testing the key controls over counterparty risk grading for wholesale loans (larger customer exposures are monitored individually). We tested the approval of new lending facilities against the Company’s lending policies, and controls over the monitoring of counterparty credit quality. This included testing controls over the identification of exposures showing signs of stress, either due to internal factors specific to the counterparty or external macroeconomic factors, and testing the timeliness of and the accuracy of counterparty risk assessments and risk grading against the requirements of the Company’s lending policies and regulatory requirements; and"}
{"context": "For retail loans, testing controls over the systems which record lending arrears, group exposures into delinquency buckets, and re-calculate individual allowances. We tested automated calculation and change management controls and evaluated the Company’s oversight of the portfolios, with a focus on controls over delinquency monitoring. We tested a sample of the level of allowances held against different loan products based on the delinquency profile and challenged assumptions made in respect of expected recoveries, including from collateral held."}
{"context": "We also tested relevant General Information Technology Controls (GITCs) over the key IT applications used by the Company in measuring ECL allowances as detailed in the IT Systems and Controls key audit matter below."}
{"context": "In addition to controls testing, our procedures included:"}
{"context": "Performing credit assessments of a sample of wholesale loans controlled by the Company’s specialist workout and recovery team assessed as higher risk or impaired, and a sample of other loans, focusing on larger exposures assessed by the Company as showing signs of deterioration, or in areas of emerging risk (assessed against external market conditions). We challenged the Company’s risk grading of the loan, assessment of loan recoverability, valuation of security and the impact on the credit allowance. To do this, we used the information on the Company’s loan file, understood the facts and circumstances of the case with the loan officer, and performed our own assessment of recoverability. Exercising our judgment, our procedures included using our understanding of relevant industries and the macroeconomic environment and comparing data and assumptions used by the Company in recoverability assessments to externally sourced evidence, such as commodity prices, publicly available audited financial statements and comparable external valuations of collateral held. Where relevant we assessed the forecast timing of future cash flows in the context of supporting valuations and approved business plans and challenged key assumptions implicit in the valuations;"}

{"context": "The Key Audit Matter Financial instruments held at fair value on the Company’s balance sheet include investment securities, trading securities, derivative assets and liabilities, certain debt securities, and other assets and liabilities designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income. The instruments are mainly risk management products sold to customers and used by the Company to manage its own interest rate and foreign exchange risk."}
{"context": "The valuation of financial instruments held at fair value is considered a Key Audit Matter as:"}
{"context": "Financial instruments held at fair value are significant (25% of assets and 14% of liabilities);"}
{"context": "The significant volume and range of products transacted, in a number of international locations, increases the risk of inconsistencies in transaction management processes that could lead to inaccurate valuation;"}
{"context": "Determining the fair value of trading securities and derivatives involves a significant level of judgement by the Company, increasing the risk of error, and adding complexity to our audit. The level of judgement increases where internal models, as opposed to quoted market prices, are used to determine fair value of an instrument, or where inputs to the internal models, such as discount rates and measures of volatility, are not observable; or where there are a greater number of variables, including trade economic details and modelling assumptions, which feed into the internal models; and"}
{"context": "The valuation of certain derivatives held by the Company is sensitive to inputs including funding rates, probabilities of default and loss given default. Both funding and credit risk are incorporated within the valuation of certain derivative instruments. This increased our audit effort in this area and necessitated the involvement of valuation specialists."}
{"context": "How the matter was addressed in our audit Our audit procedures for the valuation of financial instruments held at fair value included:"}

{"context": "Evaluating the appropriateness of the Company’s valuation methodology for derivative financial instruments, having regard to current and emerging derivative valuation practices across a range of peer institutions, and against the required criteria in the accounting standards. We tested adjustments made to valuations, particularly funding and credit valuation adjustments on un-collateralised derivatives. In particular, for a sample of individual counterparties, across locations, we tested key inputs to the credit valuation adjustment calculation, including the probability of default, against observable market data. Where proxies were used, we assessed the proxy against available alternatives, across a number of locations."}
