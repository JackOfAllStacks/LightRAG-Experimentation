{"context": "Chapter 1 - Introduction"}
{"context": "Purpose of this document"}
{"context": "This document has been prepared in accordance with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) ADI Prudential Standard (APS) 330: Public Disclosure."}
{"context": "APS 330 mandates the release to the investment community and general public of information relating to capital adequacy and risk management practices. APS 330 was established to implement Pillar 3 of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s framework for bank capital adequacy2. In simple terms, the Basel framework consists of three mutually reinforcing ‘Pillars’:"}
{"context": "Pillar 1"}
{"context": "Pillar 2"}
{"context": "Pillar 3"}
{"context": "Minimum capital requirement"}
{"context": "Supervisory review process"}
{"context": "Market discipline"}
{"context": "Minimum capital requirements for Credit Risk, Operational Risk, Market Risk and Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book"}
{"context": "Firm-wide risk oversight, Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), consideration of additional risks, capital buffers and targets and risk concentrations, etc."}
{"context": "Regular disclosure to the market of qualitative and quantitative aspects of capital adequacy and underlying risk metrics"}
{"context": "risk management,"}
{"context": "APS 330 requires the publication of various levels of information on a quarterly, semi-annual and annual basis. This document is the annual disclosure."}
{"context": "Basel in ANZ"}
{"context": "In December 2007, ANZ received accreditation for the most advanced approaches permitted under Basel for credit risk and operational risk, complementing its accreditation for market risk. Effective January 2013, ANZ adopted APRA requirements for Basel III with respect to the measurement and monitoring of regulatory capital."}
{"context": "Verification of disclosures"}
{"context": "These Pillar 3 disclosures have been verified in accordance with Board approved policy, including ensuring consistency with information contained in ANZ’s Financial Report and in Pillar 1 returns provided to APRA. In addition, ANZ’s external auditor has performed an agreed upon procedure review with respect to these disclosures."}
{"context": "Comparison to ANZ’s Financial Reporting"}
{"context": "These disclosures have been produced in accordance with regulatory capital adequacy concepts and rules, rather than with accounting policies adopted in ANZ’s financial reports. As such, there are different areas of focus and measures in some common areas of disclosures. These differences are most pronounced in the credit risk disclosures, for instance:"}
{"context": "The principal method for measuring the amount at risk is Exposure at Default (EAD), which is the estimated amount of exposure likely to be owed on a credit obligation at the time of default. Under the Advanced Internal Ratings Based (AIRB) approach in APS 113 Capital Adequacy: Internal Ratings-based Approach to Credit Risk, banks are accredited to provide their own estimates of EAD for all exposures (drawn, commitments or contingents) reflecting the current balance as well as the likelihood of additional drawings prior to default."}
{"context": "Loss Given Default (LGD) is an estimate of the amount of losses expected in the event of default. LGD is essentially calculated as the amount at risk (EAD) less expected net recoveries from realisation of collateral as well as any post default repayments of principal and interest."}
{"context": "Most credit risk disclosures split ANZ’s portfolio into regulatory asset classes, which span different areas of ANZ’s internal divisional and business unit organisational structure."}
{"context": "Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are rounded to AUD millions."}

{"context": "September 2019"}
{"context": "Chapter 2 – Risk appetite and governance"}
{"context": "Risk types: ANZ is exposed to a broad range of inter-related business risks."}
{"context": "Capital Adequacy risk is the risk of loss arising from the Group failing to maintain the level of capital required by prudential regulators and other key stakeholders (shareholders, debt investors, depositors, rating agencies, etc.) to support ANZ’s consolidated operations and risk appetite."}
{"context": "Compliance risk is the risk of failure to act in accordance with laws, regulations, industry standards and codes, internal policies and procedures and principles of good governance as applicable to ANZ’s businesses."}
{"context": "Credit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from a counterparty failing to fulfil its obligations or a decrease in credit quality of a counterparty resulting in a financial loss. Credit Risk incorporates the risks associated with us lending to customers who could be impacted by climate change or by changes to laws, regulations, or other policies adopted by governments or regulatory authorities, including carbon pricing and climate change adaptation or mitigation policies."}
{"context": "Equity risk is the risk of financial loss arising from the unexpected reduction in value of equity investments not held in the trading book including those of the Group’s associates."}
{"context": "Insurance risk is risk of unexpected losses resulting from worse than expected claims experience, including any of the following that expose an insurer to financial loss: inadequate or inappropriate underwriting, claims management, reserving, insurance concentrations, reinsurance management, product design and pricing."}
{"context": "Market risk stems from ANZ’s trading and balance sheet activities and is the risk to the Group’s earnings arising from changes in any interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, volatility, and correlations or from fluctuations in bond, commodity or equity prices."}
{"context": "Liquidity and Funding risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due, including repaying depositors or maturing wholesale debt or the Group having insufficient capacity to fund increases in assets."}
{"context": "Operational risk is risk of loss and/or non-compliance with laws resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and/or systems, or from external events. This definition includes legal risk, and the risk of reputation loss, or damage arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, but excludes strategic risk."}
{"context": "Reputation risk"}
{"context": "is defined as the risk of loss that directly or indirectly impacts earnings, capital adequacy or value, that is caused by adverse perceptions of the Group held by any of customers, the community, 3 shareholders, investors, regulators, or rating agencies, conduct risk associated with the Group’s employees or contractors (or both) or the social or environmental (or both) impacts of our lending decisions."}
{"context": "Securitisation risk is the risk of credit related losses greater than expected due to a securitisation failing to operate as anticipated, or of the values and risks accepted or transferred, not emerging as expected."}
{"context": "Strategic risk is the risk that the Group’s business strategy and strategic objectives may lead to an increase in other key Material Risks — for example: Credit Risk, Market Risk and Operational Risk."}
{"context": "Technology risk is the risk of loss and/or non-compliance with laws resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events impacting on IT assets, including the compromise of an IT asset’s confidentiality, integrity or availability."}
{"context": "3 Regulatory Capital is calculated in accordance with the definition of Operational Risk outlined in APS 115 Capital Adequacy: Advanced Measurement Approaches to Operational Risk, and therefore excludes reputation risk considerations."}

{"context": "September 2019"}
{"context": "Risk Appetite Framework"}
{"context": "ANZ's Board is ultimately responsible for ANZ’s risk management framework, which includes the Group Risk Appetite Statement (RAS). The Group RAS is the document which clearly and concisely sets out the Board’s expectations regarding the degree of risk that ANZ is prepared to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives and business plan."}
{"context": "The articulation of risk appetite and risk tolerances is central to the risk appetite statement. ANZ’s Group RAS conveys the following:"}
{"context": "The degree of risk (risk appetite) that ANZ is prepared to accept in pursuit of its strategy, objectives and business plans with consideration of its shareholders’ and customers’ best interests."}
{"context": "For each material risk, ANZ has set the maximum level of risk (risk tolerance) that it is willing to operate within, expressed as a risk limit and based on its risk appetite, risk profile and capital strength. Risk tolerances translate risk appetite into operational limits for the day-to-day management of material risks, where possible."}
{"context": "The process for ensuring that risk tolerances are set at an appropriate level, based on an estimate of the impact in the event that a risk tolerance is breached, and the likelihood that each material risk is realised."}
{"context": "The process for monitoring compliance with each risk tolerance and for taking appropriate action in the event that it is breached; and"}
{"context": "The timing and process for review of the risk appetite and risk tolerances."}
{"context": "Risk management governance"}
{"context": "The Board is principally responsible for overseeing the establishment by Management of a sound risk management culture with an operational structure and the necessary resources to facilitate effective risk management throughout ANZ, and which in turn supports the ability of ANZ to operate consistently within its risk appetite and approves the risk appetite within which management is expected to operate and including ANZ’s risk appetite statement and risk management strategy. The Committees and their purpose are:"}
{"context": "Risk Committee The purpose of the Risk Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in the effective discharge of its responsibilities for business, market, credit, equity and other investment, financial, operational, liquidity and reputational risk management and for the management of the Group’s compliance obligations. The Risk Committee also assists the Board by providing an objective non-executive oversight of the implementation by management of ANZ’s risk management framework and its related operation and by enabling an institution-wide view of ANZ’s current and future risk position relative to its risk appetite and capital strength. The Committee meets at least four times annually."}
{"context": "Audit Committee Assists the Board of Directors in reviewing: financial reporting principles and policies, controls and procedures; the effectiveness of ANZ's internal control and risk management framework; the work of Internal Audit which reports directly to the Board Audit Committee; the integrity of ANZ’s financial statements and the independent audit thereof and compliance with related legal and regulatory requirements; due diligence procedures; prudential supervision procedures and other regulatory requirements to the extent relating to financial reporting and for reviewing reports from major subsidiary audit committees. It’s also responsible for the appointment and evaluation of the external auditor. The committee meets at least four times annually."}
{"context": "Digital Business and Technology Committee The purpose of the Digital Business and Technology Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in the effective discharge of its responsibilities in connection with the oversight of ANZ’s information technology, digitalisation and technology-related innovation strategies. The Committee meets at least three times annually."}
{"context": "Human Resource Committee The Committee is responsible for, among other matters, reviewing and making recommendations to the Board with regard to the remuneration of ANZ Board Appointees and ANZ Material Risk Takers, the design of executive remuneration structures and significant incentive plans and the Group’s Remuneration Policy. It also approves the appointment and termination of ANZ Board Appointees (excluding the CEO, CRO and GGM-IA4), reviews senior executive succession plans and monitors the effectiveness of ANZ’s culture, employee engagement and diversity and inclusion programs. The Committee meets at least four times annually."}
{"context": "Ethics, Environment, Social and Governance Committee Amongst other matters, the Committee reviews the development of and approves all other corporate governance policies and principles applicable to ANZ and seeks to ensure an appropriate Board and Committee structure is in place. It seeks to ensure there is a robust and effective process for evaluating the performance of the Board, Board Committee and Non-Executive Directors. It also reviews, monitors and approves ANZ’s corporate sustainability objectives and provides advice to management on sustainability issues within ANZ. The Committee meets at least twice annually."}
{"context": "The above Committees are exclusively comprised of Non-Executive directors. Members, including the Chair are appointed by the Board and serve at the discretion of the Board and for such term or terms as the Board determines."}
{"context": "Processes and procedures relating to the operation of each of the board committees are documented in the committee charters and in the Board Committees’ Standing Rules."}

{"context": "Executive Management Committees are responsible for co-ordination of risk matters for each of the areas of risk management. The Executive Management Committees most relevant to the risks described above and overall capital management at ANZ are as follows:"}
{"context": "Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO)"}
{"context": "GALCO is responsible for the oversight and strategic management of the ANZ’s balance sheet activities including balance sheet structure, liquidity, funding, capital management, non-traded interest rate risk, and non-traded FX risks and exposures. The Committee meets at least 4 times a year, or more frequently as required."}
{"context": "Credit and Market Risk Committee (CMRC) CMRC is responsible for the oversight and control of credit, market, insurance and material financial risks across the ANZ Group. The Committee meets monthly, with additional meetings as required."}

The committee meets at least six times per year, with additional meetings as required."}
{"context": "Ethics and Responsible Business Committee (ERBC) ERBC is a leadership and decision making body that exists to advance ANZ’s purpose, namely to shape a world where people and communities thrive. The Committee meets at least 4 times a year, or more frequently as required."}
{"context": "Credit Ratings System Oversight Committee (CRSOC) CRSOC is a sub-committee of CMRC responsible for the oversight and control of the Internal Ratings System for credit risk including credit model approvals and performance monitoring. The Committee meets at least 4 times a year, or more frequently as required."}
{"context": "Capital and Stress Testing Oversight Committee (CSTOC) CSTOC is responsible for the oversight and control of the Group’s stress testing framework, modelling and processes, economic profit methodology and framework, capital allocation framework and other capital management (apart from Group ICAAP) and portfolio measurement related recommendations. The Committee meets a minimum of three times per year, with additional meetings at the discretion of the Chair. CSTOC is a sub-committee of GALCO."}

{"context": "Chapter 3 – Capital reporting and measurement"}
{"context": "Capital reporting and measurement"}
{"context": "To ensure that an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) is adequately capitalised on both a standalone and group basis, APRA adopts a tiered approach to the measurement of an ADI’s capital adequacy by assessing the ADI’s financial strength at three levels:"}
{"context": "Level 1 - being the ADI i.e. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, consolidated with APRA approved subsidiaries, to form the ADI’s Extended Licensed Entity (ELE)."}
{"context": "Level 2 - being the consolidated group for financial reporting purposes adjusted to exclude associates activities and certain subsidiaries referenced under APS 001: Definitions that undertake the following business activities:"}
{"context": "•"}
{"context": "•"}
{"context": "Insurance businesses (including friendly societies and health funds). Acting as manager, responsible entity, approved trustee, trustee or similar role in relation to funds management. Non-financial (commercial) operations. Securitisation special purpose vehicles to which assets have been transferred in accordance with APRA's requirements as set out in APS 120: Securitisation."}
{"context": "Level 3 – the consolidated group for financial reporting purposes."}
{"context": "APRA is extending its prudential supervision framework to Conglomerate Groups via the Level 3 framework which will regulate a bancassurance group such as ANZ as a single economic entity with minimum capital requirements and additional monitoring of risk exposure levels."}
{"context": "In August 2016, APRA confirmed the deferral of capital requirements for Conglomerate Groups to allow for the final capital requirements arising from FSI recommendations and from international initiatives to be determined."}
{"context": "The non-capital components of the Level 3 framework relating to group governance, risk exposures, intragroup transactions and other risk management and compliance requirements came into effect on 1 July 2017. These have had no material impact on the Group’s capital position"}
{"context": "This Pillar 3 report is based on the Level 2 prudential structure."}

{"context": "Capital Disclosure template"}
{"context": "The head of the Level 2 Group to which this prudential standard applies is Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited."}
{"context": "Table 1 of this chapter consists of a Capital Disclosure template that assists users in understanding the differences between the application of the Basel III reforms in Australia and those rules as detailed in the document Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems, issued by the Bank for International Settlements."}
{"context": "The information in the lines of the template has been mapped to ANZ’s Level 2 balance sheet, which adjusts for non- consolidated subsidiaries as required under APS 001: Definitions. Where this information cannot be mapped on a one to one basis, it is provided in an explanatory table. ANZ’s material non-consolidated subsidiaries are also listed in this chapter."}
{"context": "Restrictions on Transfers of Capital within ANZ"}
{"context": "ANZ operates branches and locally incorporated subsidiaries in many countries. These operations are capitalised at an appropriate level to cover the risks in the business and to meet local prudential requirements. This level of capitalisation may be enhanced to meet local taxation and operational requirements. Any repatriation of capital from subsidiaries or branches is subject to meeting the requirements of the local prudential regulator and/or the local central bank. Apart from ANZ’s operations in New Zealand, local country capital requirements do not impose any material call on ANZ’s capital base."}
{"context": "ANZ undertakes banking activities in New Zealand principally through its wholly owned subsidiary, ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited, which is subject to minimum capital requirements as set by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ). The RBNZ adopted the Basel II framework, effective from 1 January 2008 and Basel III reforms from 1 January 2013. ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited has been accredited to use the advanced approach for the calculation of credit risk and standardised approach for operational risk. ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited maintains a buffer above the minimum capital base required by the RBNZ. This capital buffer has been calculated via the ICAAP undertaken for ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited, to ensure ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited is appropriately capitalised under stressed economic scenarios."}

{"context": "Capital adequacy, Table 4 Credit risk, Table 5 Securitisation"}
{"context": "Table 6"}
{"context": "Capital adequacy"}
{"context": "Capital management"}
{"context": "ANZ pursues an active approach to capital management, which is designed to protect the interests of depositors, creditors and shareholders. This involves the on-going review and Board approval of the level and composition of ANZ’s capital base, assessed against the following key policy objectives:"}
{"context": "Regulatory compliance such that capital levels exceed APRA’s, ANZ’s primary prudential supervisor, minimum Prudential Capital Ratios (PCRs) both at Level 1 (the Company and specified subsidiaries) and Level 2 (ANZ consolidated under Australian prudential standards), along with US Federal Reserve’s minimum Level 2 requirements under ANZ’s Foreign Holding Company Licence in the United States of America;"}
{"context": "Capital levels are aligned with the risks in the business and to meet strategic and business development; and"}
{"context": "An appropriate balance between maximising shareholder returns and prudent capital management principles."}
{"context": "ANZ achieves these objectives through an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) where by ANZ conducts detailed strategic and capital planning over a medium term time horizon. The Capital Plan is maintained and updated through a monthly review of forecast financial performance, economic conditions and development of business initiatives and strategies. The Board and senior management are provided with monthly updates of ANZ’s capital position. Any actions required to ensure ongoing prudent capital management are submitted to the Board for approval. ANZ annually conducts a detailed strategic planning process over a three year time horizon, the outcomes of which are embodied in the Strategic Plan. This process involves forecasting key economic variables which Divisions use to determine key financial data for their existing business. New strategic initiatives to be undertaken over the planning period and their financial impact are then determined. These processes are used for the following:"}
{"context": "Review capital ratios, targets, and levels of different classes of capital against ANZ’s risk profile and risk appetite outlined in the Strategic Plan. ANZ’s capital targets reflect the key policy objectives above, and the desire to ensure that under specific stressed economic scenarios that capital levels are sufficient to remain above PCR requirements;"}
{"context": "Stress tests are performed under different economic conditions to provide a comprehensive review of ANZ’s capital position both before and after mitigating actions. The stress tests determine the level of additional capital (i.e. the ‘stress capital buffer’) needed to absorb losses that may be experienced during an economic downturn; and"}
{"context": "Stress testing is integral to strengthening the predictive approach to risk management and is a key component in managing risks, asset writing strategies and business strategies. It creates greater understanding of the impacts on financial performance through modelling relationships and sensitivities between geographic, industry and Divisional exposures under a range of macro-economic scenarios. ANZ has a dedicated stress testing team within Risk Management that models and reports to management and the Board’s Risk Committee on a range of scenarios and stress tests."}
{"context": "Results are subsequently used to: •"}
{"context": "Recalibrate ANZ’s management targets for minimum and operating ranges for its respective classes of capital such that ANZ will have sufficient capital to remain above regulatory requirements; and"}
{"context": "Identify the level of organic capital generation and hence determine current and future capital issuance requirements for Level 1 and Level 2."}
{"context": "From these processes, a Capital Plan is developed and approved by the Board which identifies the capital issuance requirements, capital securities maturity profile, and options around capital products, timing and markets to execute the Capital Plan under differing market and economic conditions."}
{"context": "The Capital Plan is maintained and updated through a monthly review of forecast financial performance, economic conditions and development of business initiatives and strategies. The Board and senior management are provided with monthly updates of ANZ’s capital position. Any actions required to ensure ongoing prudent capital management are submitted to the Board for approval."}
{"context": "19"}
{"context": "ANZ Basel III Pillar 3 Disclosure"}
{"context": "September 2019"}
{"context": "Regulatory environment"}
{"context": "ANZ’s regulatory capital calculation is governed by APRA’s Prudential Standards which adopt a risk-based capital assessment framework based on the Basel III capital measurement standards. This risk-based approach requires eligible capital to be divided by total risk weighted assets (RWA), with the resultant ratio being used as a measure of an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution’s (ADIs) capital adequacy. APRA determines PCRs for Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 and Total Capital, with capital as the numerator and RWAs as the denominator."}
{"context": "Regulatory capital is divided into Tier 1, carrying the highest capital elements, and Tier 2, which has lower capital elements, but still adds to the overall strength of the ADI."}
{"context": "Tier 1 capital is comprised of Common Equity Tier 1 capital less deductions and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments. Common Equity Tier 1 capital comprises shareholders’ equity adjusted for items which APRA does not allow as regulatory capital or classifies as lower forms of regulatory capital. Common Equity Tier 1 capital includes the following significant adjustments:"}
{"context": "Reserves exclude the hedging reserve and reserves of insurance and funds management subsidiaries;"}
{"context": "Retained and current year earnings excluding those of insurance and funds management subsidiaries, but includes capitalised deferred fees forming part of loan yields that meet the criteria set out in the prudential standard;"}
{"context": "Inclusion of qualifying treasury shares."}
{"context": "Additional Tier 1 capital instruments are high quality components of capital that provide a permanent and unrestricted commitment of funds, are available to absorb losses, are subordinated to the claims of depositors and senior creditors in the event of the winding up of the issuer and provide for fully discretionary capital distributions."}
{"context": "Deductions from the capital base comprise mainly deductions to the Common Equity Tier 1 component. These deductions are largely intangible assets, investments in insurance and funds management entities and associates, capitalised expenses (including loan and origination fees), and net deferred tax assets."}
{"context": "Tier 2 capital mainly comprises perpetual subordinated debt instruments and dated subordinated debt instruments which have a minimum term of five years at issue date."}
{"context": "Total Capital is the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital."}
{"context": "In addition to the prudential capital oversight that APRA conducts over the Company and the Group, the Company’s branch operations and major banking subsidiary operations are overseen by local regulators such as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the US Federal Reserve, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the China Banking Regulatory Commission who may impose minimum capitalisation rates on those operations."}
{"context": "Throughout the financial year, the Company and the Group maintained compliance with the minimum Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios set by APRA and the US Federal Reserve (as applicable) as well as applicable capitalisation rates set by regulators in countries where the Company operates branches and subsidiaries."}
{"context": "Regulatory development There are a number of matters currently outstanding that may have an impact on ANZ’s regulatory capital in the future. Details of these matters are available in ANZ’s 2019 Full Year Results Announcement Group Results section, pages 50-51, available on ANZ’s website: shareholder.anz.com/pages/results-announcement-archive."}

{"context": "Definition of credit risk"}
{"context": "Credit Risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from a counterparty failing to fulfil its credit obligations, or from a decrease in credit quality of a counterparty resulting in a loss in value."}
{"context": "Regulatory approval to use the Advanced Internal Ratings-based approach"}
{"context": "ANZ has been given approval by APRA to use the Advanced Internal Ratings (AIRB) based approach to credit risk, under APS 113 Capital Adequacy: Internal Ratings-based Approach to Credit Risk. As an AIRB bank, ANZ’s internal models generate the inputs into regulatory capital adequacy to determine the risk weighted exposure calculations for both on and off-balance sheet exposures, including undrawn portions of credit facilities, committed and contingent exposures and expected loss (EL) calculations."}
{"context": "ANZ’s internal models are used to generate three key risk components that serve as inputs to the IRB approach to credit risk:"}
{"context": "Probability of Default (PD) is an estimate of the level of the risk of borrower default • Exposure at Default (EAD) is defined as the expected facility exposure at the date of default • Loss Given Default (LGD) is an estimate of the potential economic loss on a credit exposure, incurred as a consequence of obligor default."}
{"context": "There are however several small portfolios (mainly retail and local corporates in Pacific, and local corporates in Asia) where ANZ applies the Standardised approach to credit risk, under APS 112 Capital Adequacy: Standardised Approach to Credit Risk."}
{"context": "Credit risk management framework and policies"}
{"context": "ANZ has a comprehensive framework to manage Wholesale Credit Risk. The framework is top down, being defined by credit principles and policies. Credit policies, requirements and procedures cover all aspects of the credit life cycle such as transaction structuring, risk grading, initial approval, ongoing management and problem debt management, as well as specialist policy topics."}
{"context": "The effectiveness of the credit risk management framework is assessed through various compliance and monitoring processes. These, together with portfolio selection and risk appetite setting, define and guide the credit process, organisation and staff."}
{"context": "Organisation"}
{"context": "The Credit and Market Risk Committee (CMRC) is a senior executive level committee responsible for the oversight and control of credit, market, insurance and material financial risks across the ANZ Group. The Credit Rating System Oversight Committee (CRSOC) supports the CMRC, by providing oversight and control of the internal ratings system for credit risk in the wholesale and retail sectors, including credit model approvals and performance monitoring."}
{"context": "The primary responsibility for prudent and profitable management of credit risk assets and customer relationships rests with the business units. An independent credit risk management function is staffed by risk specialists. Independence is achieved by having all credit risk staff ultimately report to the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), even where they are embedded in business units. Risk performs key roles in portfolio management such as development and validation of credit risk measurement systems, loan asset quality reporting, and development of credit policies and requirements. In ANZ’s wholesale businesses, Risk also provides independent credit assessment and approval on lending decisions."}
{"context": "The authority to make credit decisions is delegated by the Board to the CEO who in turn delegates authority to the CRO. The CRO in turn delegates some of their credit discretion to individuals as part of a ‘cascade’ of authority from senior to the most junior credit officers. Within ANZ, credit approval for material wholesale lending is judgementally made on a ‘dual approval’ basis, jointly by the business writer in the business unit and the respective independent credit risk officer. Individuals must be suitably skilled and accredited in order to be granted and retain credit discretion. Credit discretions are reviewed on an annual basis, and may be varied based on the holder’s performance."}
{"context": "Programmed credit assessment typically covers retail and some small business lending, and refers to the automated assessment of credit applications using a combination of scoring (application and behavioural), policy rules and external credit reporting information. Where an application does not meet the automated assessment criteria it will be referred out for manual assessment, with assessors considering the decision tool recommendation."}
{"context": "23"}
{"context": "ANZ Basel III Pillar 3 Disclosure"}
{"context": "September 2019"}
{"context": "Portfolio direction and performance"}
{"context": "The credit risk management framework contains several portfolio direction and performance tools which enable Risk to play a fundamental role in monitoring the direction and performance of the portfolio. These include:"}
{"context": "Group and divisional level risk appetite strategies, business writing strategies and segment transaction guidelines are prepared by the businesses and set out appetite, planned portfolio growth, capital usage and risk/return profile, and also identify areas that may require attention to mitigate and improve risk management;"}
{"context": "Regular portfolio reviews; and"}
{"context": "Exposure concentration limits, covering single customers, industries and cross border risk, to ensure a diversified portfolio."}
{"context": "ANZ uses portfolio monitoring and analysis tools, technologies and techniques to assist with portfolio risk assessment and management. These assist in:"}
{"context": "Monitoring, analysing and reporting ANZ’s credit risk profile and progress in meeting portfolio objectives;"}
{"context": "Calculating and reporting ANZ’s collectively assessed provision, economic capital, expected loss, regulatory risk weighted assets (RWA) and regulatory expected loss;"}
{"context": "Assessing impact of emerging issues, and conducting ad-hoc investigations and analysis;"}
{"context": "Validating rating/scoring tools and credit estimates; and"}
{"context": "Ongoing review and refinement of ANZ's credit risk measurement and policy framework."}
{"context": "Credit Risk Reporting"}
{"context": "Credit risk management information systems, reporting and analysis are managed centrally and at the divisional and business unit level."}
{"context": "Periodic reporting assists in analysing the effectiveness of strategies and processes identifying emerging issues and monitoring of portfolio trends by all levels of management and the Board."}
{"context": "Examples of reports include EAD, portfolio mix, risk grade profiles and migrations, RWAs, large exposure reporting, credit watch and control lists, impaired assets and provisions."}
{"context": "Exposure at default"}
{"context": "EAD is defined as the expected facility exposure at the date of default. Unless otherwise stated, throughout this disclosure EAD represents credit exposure net of offsets for credit risk mitigation such as guarantees, credit derivatives, netting and financial collateral."}
{"context": "Past due facilities"}
{"context": "Facilities where a contractual payment has not been met or the customer is outside of contractual arrangements for a material length of time are deemed past due. Past due facilities include those operating in excess of approved arrangements or where scheduled repayments are outstanding, but do not include impaired assets."}
{"context": "Impaired assets8"}
{"context": "A facility for which there is doubt about timely payment of principal, interest and fees being achieved and / or a material credit obligation is 90 days or more past due and is not well secured. It includes all problem assets, off- balance sheet exposures (including derivatives) and assets brought to ANZ’s balance sheet through the enforcement of security. Impaired derivatives have a credit valuation adjustment, which is a market assessment of the credit risk of the relevant counterparties."}
{"context": "Restructured items"}
{"context": "Restructured items comprise facilities in which the original contractual terms have been modified for reasons related to the financial difficulties of the customer. Restructuring may consist of reduction of interest, principal or other payments legally due, or an extension in maturity materially beyond those typically offered to new facilities with similar risk."}
{"context": "8 The definition of Impaired Assets for accounting purposes is a default occurs when there are indicators that a debtor is unlikely to fully satisfy contractual credit obligations to the Group, or the exposure is 90 days past due. Financial assets, including those that are well secured, are considered credit impaired for financial reporting purposes when they are in default."}
{"context": "24"}
{"context": "ANZ Basel III Pillar 3 Disclosure"}
{"context": "September 2019"}
{"context": "Collectively Assessed Provisions for Credit Impairment"}
{"context": "Collectively assessed provisions for credit impairment represent the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculated in accordance with AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9) which commenced 1 October 2018. These incorporate forward looking information and do not require an actual loss event to have occurred for an impairment provision to be recognised."}
{"context": "Under AASB 9, ECL is either measured over 12 months or the expected lifetime of the financial asset, depending on the credit deterioration since origination, according to the following three-stage approach:"}
{"context": "Stage 1: At the origination of a financial asset, and where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, a provision equivalent to 12 months ECL is recognised. For instruments with a remaining maturity of less than 12 months, a provision calculated on the remaining term of the maturity is recognised."}
{"context": "Stage 2: Where there has been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, a provision equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised."}
{"context": "Stage 3: Where there is objective evidence of impairment, a provision equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised."}
{"context": "In determining what constitutes a SICR, ANZ considers both qualitative and quantitative information, including CCR at origination and at the reporting date."}
{"context": "ECL is calculated as the product of PD, LGD and EAD at a facility level, discounted for incorporating the effect of time value of money. These credit risk factors are adjusted for current and forward looking information through the use of macro-economic variables in the model."}
{"context": "Individually Assessed Provisions for Credit Impairment"}
{"context": "Individually assessed provisions for credit impairment are calculated in accordance with AASB 9. They are assessed on a case-by-case basis for all individually managed impaired assets taking into consideration factors such as the realisable value of security (or other credit mitigants), the likely return available upon liquidation or bankruptcy, legal uncertainties, estimated costs involved in recovery, the market price of the exposure in secondary markets and the amount and timing of expected receipts and recoveries."}

{"context": "Facilities are written off against the related provision for impairment when they are assessed as partially or fully uncollectable, and after proceeds from the realisation of any collateral have been received. Where individually assessed provisions recognised in previous periods have subsequently decreased or are no longer required, such impairment losses are reversed in the current period income statement."}

{"context": "the customer’s overdraft or other revolving facility(ies) have been continuously outside approved limits for 90 or more consecutive days."}
{"context": "Specific Provision and General Reserve for Credit Losses"}
{"context": "Due to definitional differences, there is a difference in the split between ANZ’s individually assessed provision and collectively assessed provision for accounting purposes and the specific provision and general reserve for credit losses (GRCL) for regulatory purposes. This does not impact total provisions, and essentially relates to the classification of collectively assessed provisions on defaulted accounts. The disclosures in this document are based on individually assessed provision and collectively assessed provision, for ease of comparison with other published results."}
{"context": "APRA has flagged that the adoption of the forward looking ECL approach means that a GRCL will no longer be required. This is likely to take effect at the commencement of the revised APS 220 prudential standard expected in mid 2020."}
{"context": "Exposure at Default in Table 7 represents credit exposure net of offsets for credit risk mitigation such as guarantees, credit derivatives, netting and financial collateral. It includes Advanced IRB, Specialised Lending and Standardised exposures, and excludes Securitisation, Equities or Other Assets exposures."}

{"context": "17 In the September 2019 half, ANZ implemented a revised process for the identification of impaired assets, and a more market responsive collateral valuation methodology for the home loan portfolio in Australia which increased the number of home loans being classified as impaired rather than past due. Comparative information has not been restated for the change in methodology. Additional refinement to underlying processes and associated data resulted in the transfer of loans from past due and sub-standard categories into impaired assets. Comparative information has been restated with a transfer of $106 million at March 2019 and $126 million at September 2018."}

For these counterparties, external ratings by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service are used as inputs into the RWA calculation. As described in the section on the ANZ rating system, ANZ has mapped its master scale to the grading of these two External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs)."}

{"context": "Measure the LGD as expressed by the Security Indicator (SI) ranging from A to G. The SI is calculated by reference to the percentage of a loan covered by security which can be realised in the event of default. This calculation uses standard ratios to adjust the current market value of collateral items to allow for historical realisation outcomes. The security-related SIs are supplemented with a range of other SIs which cover such factors as cash cover, mezzanine finance, intra-group guarantees and sovereign backing as ANZ’s LGD research indicates that these transaction characteristics have different recovery outcomes. ANZ’s LGD also includes recognition of the different legal and insolvency regimes in different countries, where this has been shown to influence recovery outcomes. ANZ’s corporate PD master scale is APRA approved, and is made up of 27 rating grades. Each level/grade is separately defined and has a range of default probabilities attached to it. The PD master scale enables ANZ’s rating system to be mapped to the grading’s of external rating agencies, using the PD as a common element after ensuring that default definitions and other key attributes are aligned."}

{"context": "The design, build and implementation of credit rating models resides with a specialist Group-level team. Credit rating models are owned by central Risk teams. The use (including overrides) and performance of credit rating models is monitored by the relevant business and their counterparts in Risk, and validated regularly by a separate specialist Group-level function. This cycle of design, build, implementation, monitoring and validation is overseen by the CRSOC, and informs the need for new models or recalibration of existing models."}
{"context": "Group Credit Assurance (within Global Internal Audit) provides third line independent credit related assurance activities, including providing an independent assessment of both the asset quality in the portfolio and the quality of credit decision making. It also assesses management controls from a “top down” portfolio oversight perspective as well as credit risk processes from a “bottom up” perspective based on individual customer file reviews."}
{"context": "Risk grades are an integral part of reporting to the Board and executives."}

{"context": "Rating process by asset class"}
{"context": "Building reliable and accurate rating tools requires balancing of many factors including data availability (external data may be used in some circumstances, where it is relevant), the size of the segment (the more customers within the segment, the more likely that statistically reliable models can be built), and the need to be able to validate the model. Rating tool approaches include:"}

{"context": "Regardless of what credit risk rating tool is used, lending staff rating a customer are required to review the model- generated PD (or CCR) and take into account any out-of-model factors or policy overlays to decide whether or not to override the model rating. Overrides of a rating model to a better rating require approval from the independent credit risk function. The significance of the model for risk grading varies with the customer segment: models will dominate risk grading of homogenous, simple and data-rich segments such as in Retail, however for complex, specialised business segments expert knowledge and the highly customised nature of transactions will influence the rating outcome."}

{"context": "Main types of collateral taken by ANZ"}
{"context": "Collateral is used to mitigate credit risk, as the secondary source of repayment in case the counterparty cannot meet its contractual repayment obligations.35 Types of collateral typically taken by ANZ include:"}
{"context": "Charges over residential, commercial, industrial or rural property,"}
{"context": "Charges over business assets,"}
{"context": "Charges over specific plant and equipment,"}
{"context": "Charges over listed shares, bonds or securities,"}
{"context": "Charges over cash deposits, and"}
{"context": "Guarantees and pledges."}
{"context": "In some cases, such as where the customer risk profile is considered very sound or by the nature of the product, a transaction may not be supported by collateral."}
{"context": "Our credit policy, requirements and processes set out the acceptable types of collateral, as well as a process by which additional instruments and/or asset types can be considered for approval. ANZ’s credit risk modelling teams use historical internal loss data and other relevant external data to assist in determining the discount that each type would be expected to incur in a forced sale. The discounted value is used in the determination of the SI."}
{"context": "Policies and processes for collateral valuation and management"}
{"context": "ANZ has well established policies, requirements and processes around collateral valuation and management, that are reviewed regularly. The concepts of legal enforceability, certainty and current valuation are central to collateral management."}
{"context": "In order to achieve legal enforceability and certainty, ANZ uses standard collateral instruments or has specific documentation drawn up by external legal advisers, and where applicable, security interests are registered. The use of collateral management systems also provides certainty that the collateral has been properly taken, registered and stored."}
{"context": "In order to rely on the valuation of collateral assets, ANZ has developed comprehensive rules around acceptable types of valuations (including who may value an asset), the frequency of revaluations and standard extension ratios for typical asset types. Upon receipt of a new valuation in wholesale lending, the information is used to recalculate the SI (or to reassess the adequacy of the provision, in the case of an impaired asset), thereby ensuring that the exposure has an updated LGD attached to it for risk quantification purposes."}
{"context": "Guarantee support"}
{"context": "Within wholesale lending, guarantee support for lending proposals are an integral component in transaction structuring for ANZ. The guarantee of a financially stronger party can help improve the PD of a transaction through its explicit support of the weaker rated borrower."}
{"context": "Guarantees that are recognised for risk rating purposes may be provided by parties that include associated entities, banks, sovereigns or individuals. Credit requirements provide threshold parameters to determine acceptable counterparties in achieving risk grade enhancement of the transaction."}
{"context": "The suitability of the guarantor is determined by risk rating that guarantor. Not all guarantees or guarantors are recognised for risk grading purposes."}
{"context": "Use of credit derivatives for risk mitigation"}
{"context": "ANZ uses purchased credit derivatives to mitigate credit risk by lowering exposures to reference entities that generate high concentration risk exposures or to improve risk return performance. Only certain credit derivatives such as credit default swaps (CDS) are recognised for risk mitigation purposes in the determination of regulatory capital. Standard, legally enforceable documentation applies."}
{"context": "For regulatory capital purposes, ANZ only recognises protection using credit derivatives where they meet several policy and regulatory requirements around the strength of the protection offered such as being irrevocable."}
{"context": "35 For some products, the collateral provided is fundamental to its structuring so is not strictly the secondary source of repayment. For example, lending secured by trade receivables is typically repaid by the collection of those receivables."}
{"context": "51"}
{"context": "ANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure"}
{"context": "September 2019"}
{"context": "A CDS may only be transacted with banks and non-bank financial institutions that have been credit assessed and approved by a designated specialist credit officer. All parties must meet minimum credit standards and be allocated a related credit limit. In the event that the creditworthiness of a credit protection provider falls below the minimum required to provide effective protection, the protection is no longer recognised as an effective risk mitigant for regulatory purposes."}
{"context": "The use of netting"}
{"context": "Netting is a form of credit risk mitigation in that it reduces EAD, by offsetting a customer’s positive and negative balances with ANZ."}
{"context": "In order to apply on-balance sheet netting, the arrangement must be specifically documented with the customer and meet a number of legally enforceable requirements."}
{"context": "Netting is also used where the credit exposure arises from off-balance sheet market related transactions. For close- out netting to be utilised with counterparties, a legally enforceable eligible netting agreement in an acceptable jurisdiction must be in place. This means that each transaction is aggregated into a single net amount and transactions are netted to arrive at a single overall sum."}
{"context": "Transaction structuring to mitigate credit risk"}
{"context": "Besides collateral, guarantee support and derivatives described above, credit risk mitigation can also be furthered by prudent transaction structuring. For example, the risk in project finance lending can be mitigated by lending covenants, loan syndication and political risk insurance."}
{"context": "Concentrations of credit risk mitigation"}
{"context": "Taking collateral raises the possibility that ANZ may inadvertently increase its risk by becoming exposed to collateral concentrations. For example, in the same way that an over-exposure to a particular industry may mean that a bank is more sensitive to the fortunes of that industry, an over-exposure to a particular collateral asset type may make ANZ more sensitive to the performance of that asset type."}
{"context": "ANZ does not believe that it has any material concentrations of collateral types, given the well diversified nature of its portfolio and conservative asset extension ratios."}

{"context": "General disclosures for derivatives and counterparty credit risk"}
{"context": "Definition of Counterparty Credit Risk"}
{"context": "Counterparty credit risk in derivative transactions arises from the risk of counterparty default before settlement date of derivative contracts and the counterparty is unable to fulfil present and future contractual payment obligations. The amount at risk may change over time as a function of the underlying market parameters up to the positive value of the contract in favour of ANZ."}
{"context": "Counterparty credit risk is present in market instruments (derivatives and forward contracts), and comprises:"}
{"context": "Settlement risk, which arises where one party makes payment or delivers value in the expectation but without certainty that the counterparty will perform the corresponding obligation in a bilateral contract at settlement date."}
{"context": "Market replacement risk (pre-settlement risk), which is the risk that a counterparty will default during the life of a derivative contract and that a loss will be incurred in covering the position."}
{"context": "ANZ transacts market instruments with the following counterparties:"}
{"context": "End users – would typically use Over the Counter (OTC) derivative instruments provided by ANZ to manage price movement risk associated with their core business activity."}
{"context": "Professional counterparties – ANZ may hedge price movement risks by entering into transactions with professional counterparties that conduct two way (buy and sell) business."}
{"context": "Counterparty credit risk requires a different method to calculate exposure at default because actual and potential market movements impact ANZ’s exposure or replacement cost over the life of derivative contracts. The markets covered by this treatment include the derivative activities associated with interest rate, foreign exchange, CDS, equity, commodity and repurchase agreement (repo) products."}
{"context": "Counterparty credit risk governance"}
{"context": "ANZ’s counterparty credit risk management is governed by its credit principles, policies and procedures. The Markets Risk function is responsible for determining the counterparty credit risk exposure methodology applied to market instruments, in the framework for counterparty credit limit management, measurement and reporting."}
{"context": "The counterparty credit risk associated with derivative transactions is governed by credit limit setting consistent with all credit exposures to the ANZ Group. Counterparty credit limits are approved by the appropriate credit delegation holders."}
{"context": "Counterparty credit risk measurement and reporting"}
{"context": "The approach to measure counterparty credit risk exposure is based on internal models. These measures are referred to as potential credit risk exposure (PCRE) and potential future exposure (PFE) and measure the maximum credit exposure of derivative transactions at future time points to ANZ. PFE is measured at the 97.5th percentile at future pre-described time points, and PCRE is a 97.5th percentile averaged over time points."}
{"context": "PCRE factors recognise that prices may change over the remaining period to maturity, and that risk decreases as the contract’s remaining term to maturity decreases. In general terms PCRE is calculated by applying a risk weighting or volatility factor to the face value of the notional principal of individual trades."}
{"context": "PFE simulates relevant risk factors in a portfolio by taking into account the relevant volatilities and correlations calibrated to historical market data."}
{"context": "56"}
{"context": "ANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure"}
{"context": "September 2019"}
{"context": "Credit valuation adjustment (CVA)"}
{"context": "Over the life of a derivative instrument, ANZ uses a CVA model to adjust fair value to take into account the impact of counterparty credit quality. The methodology calculates the present value of expected losses over the life of the financial instrument as a function of PD, LGD, and expected credit risk exposure."}
{"context": "APRA requires banks, including ANZ, to hold additional risk based capital to cover the risk of CVA mark to market losses associated with deterioration in counterparty credit worthiness when entering into derivatives transactions."}
{"context": "Wrong way risk"}
{"context": "ANZ’s management of counterparty credit risk also considers the possibility of wrong way risk, which emerges when PD is adversely correlated with counterparty credit risk exposures."}
{"context": "Counterparty credit risk mitigation and credit enhancements"}
{"context": "ANZ’s primary tools to mitigate counterparty credit risk include:"}
{"context": "A bilateral netting master agreement (e.g. by International Swaps and Derivatives Association – (ISDA)) allowing close-out netting of exposures in a portfolio with offsetting contracts, with a single net payment with the same legal counterparty."}
{"context": "Use of collateral agreements in some transactions based on standard market documentation (i.e. ISDA master agreement with credit support annex or CSA) that governs the amount of collateral required to be posted or received by ANZ throughout the life of the contract. Reasons for requiring collateral include:"}
{"context": "Variation Margin – reflects the current mark-to-market exposure."}
{"context": "Initial Margin – covers the future potential exposure that could arise from future changes in market value"}
{"context": "Since March 2017, APRA’s CPS 226 “Margining and risk mitigation for non-centrally cleared derivatives” has mandated Variation Margin and Initial Margin arrangements between covered entities, subject to trading volume thresholds. The operation of collateral agreements falls under a policy which establishes the control framework designed to ensure a robust and globally consistent approach to the management of collateralised exposures, as well as compliance with CPS 226 obligations."}
{"context": "APRA’s CPS 226 also requires ADI’s to apply risk mitigation practices for un-cleared derivatives between covered counterparties in the areas of trading relationship documentation, trade confirmation, portfolio reconciliation, portfolio compression, valuation processes and dispute resolution processes."}
{"context": "Use of right to break clauses in master agreements or in trade confirmation to reduce term of long dated derivative trades."}
{"context": "Independent limit setting, credit exposure control, monitoring and reporting of excesses against approved credit limits."}
{"context": "Additional termination triggers (close out of exposure) such as credit rating downgrade clauses and change in ownership clauses included in documentation."}
{"context": "Linking covenants and events of default in existing loan facility agreements to master agreements."}
{"context": "Settlement through Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) to eliminate settlement risk for foreign exchange transactions with CLS members."}
{"context": "Clearing certain derivative transactions through central counterparties clearing houses."}
{"context": "A specific risk appetite for Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) exposures, approved by the Board."}
{"context": "Design and implementation of limit framework and monitoring of CVA exposures, to ensure CVA exposure is within Risk appetite."}
{"context": "Use of credit derivatives and market instruments to hedge CVA."}
{"context": "In the event of a downgrading of ANZ’s rating by one notch from AA- to A+, as at 30 September 2019, ANZ would not be required to lodge additional collateral with its counterparties."}

{"context": "Chapter 6 – Securitisation"}
{"context": "Table 12"}
{"context": "Securitisation disclosures"}
{"context": "Definition of securitisation"}
{"context": "A securitisation is a financial structure where the cash flow from a pool of assets is used to service obligations to at least two different tranches or classes of creditors, typically holders of debt securities, with each class or tranche reflecting a different degree of credit risk. This stratification of credit risk means that one class of creditors is entitled to receive payments from the pool before another class."}
{"context": "Securitisation of ANZ originated assets"}
{"context": "Securitisations may be categorised as:"}
{"context": "Traditional securitisations, where legal ownership of the underlying asset pool is transferred to investors, with principal and interest paid from realisation of or regular cash flows from the assets. The Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) assets are insulated from bankruptcy of the seller or servicer."}
{"context": "Synthetic securitisations, where credit risk is transferred to a third party but legal ownership of the underlying"}
{"context": "assets remain with the originator e.g. by using credit derivatives or guarantees."}
{"context": "Covered bond transactions, whereby bonds issued by ANZ are secured by assets held in a special purpose vehicle, are not securitisation exposures."}
{"context": "ANZ adopts securitisation as a funding, capital and liquidity management tool using assets it has originated. This may involve the transfer of credit risk i.e. may provide regulatory capital relief. ANZ also operates a self-securitisation program, backed by a pool of residential mortgages, which forms part of the Bank’s contingent liquidity arrangements."}
{"context": "For these securitisation programs, ANZ will undertake roles including as the originator, sponsor, servicer and trust manager. ANZ may retain an exposure to these securitisation programs (including as facility provider and swap provider), consistent with the roles described below in ‘Third Party Securitisation Activities’ and facilities provided as described below in ‘Risk Management’."}
{"context": "Third Party Securitisation Activities"}
{"context": "ANZ’s involvement with securitisation of third-party originated assets, including residential mortgages, auto and equipment loans and trade receivables, comprises of:"}
{"context": "Provision of facilities – this may include providing facilities to securitisation vehicles in the form of funding facility provider and interest rate swap provider. Funding may be provided via an ANZ-sponsored securitisation vehicle which is consolidated onto the Bank’s financial statements, to certain clients wishing to access securitisation."}
{"context": "Services to securitisation programs may include structuring and arranging services and acting as bond manager."}
{"context": "Investment in securities – ANZ may purchase notes issued by securitisation programs."}
{"context": "For any assets ANZ has securitised or for SPVs that ANZ sponsors, any role provided by ANZ or its subsidiaries is subject to market based terms and conditions, and ANZ’s normal approval and review processes. Further, any securitisation exposures retained by ANZ or its affiliated entities are subject to ANZ’s normal approval and review processes as well as satisfying the requirements under APS 120: Securitisation."}
{"context": "Governance and Risk Management"}
{"context": "Similar to other exposures, securitisation exposures are subject to credit, market, operational liquidity and compliance risks. Governance of securitisation activities is managed in accordance with ANZ’s established risk management framework, including the credit risk and market risk frameworks described in Chapters 5 and 7. Roles and responsibilities are clearly outlined in the Bank’s policies and procedures, including:"}

{"context": "ANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure"}
{"context": "September 2019"}
{"context": "How ANZ ensures that it does not provide any implicit support to securitisations with ANZ originated assets."}
{"context": "Funding third party originated exposures and investment in securities are via balance sheet funded arrangements where such arrangements satisfy ANZ’s credit, due diligence and other business requirements."}
{"context": "Many functions within ANZ are involved in securitisation activities given the range of activities undertaken and risks that need to be managed. For origination and structuring of securitisation transactions, ANZ has a specialist securitisation team with independent Risk personnel overseeing operations. Credit decisions require joint approval by Risk business unit and respective independent credit risk officer. The securitisation team must be involved in all non- trading securitisation transactions across ANZ, which ensures consistent expert treatment. Where ANZ invests in instruments issued by securitisation programs, the relevant business unit manages these exposures until the securitisation exposures are repaid in full or sold."}
{"context": "All facilities provided to our investments in securitisation programs (across both the banking and trading books) undergo initial and ongoing due diligence requirements as outlined by APRA. This includes analysing the structure of the transaction and monitoring performance of the underlying assets of the transaction. In addition, such securitisation exposures are formally reviewed at least annually with credit discretions being exercised."}

{"context": "Credit risk management information systems, reporting and analysis are managed centrally for all securitisation exposures. In addition to the formal credit review process for ANZ’s securitisation exposures, internal reporting to the appropriate Risk and management functions provides oversight at the portfolio level. These reports include securitisation program performance, EAD, portfolio mix, and RWA."}
{"context": "The use and treatment of Credit Risk Mitigation (CRM) techniques with respect to securitisation exposures is assessed on a case-by-case basis in a manner consistent with the bank-wide CRM methodology 38."}
{"context": "Regulatory capital approaches"}
{"context": "For securitisation exposures held in ANZ’s banking book39, ANZ adopts a Standardised approach (as outlined in APS 120: Securitisation) to determine the credit risk regulatory capital charge via a hierarchy of approaches."}
{"context": "The primary rating approach is the External Ratings Based Approach (ERBA). For externally rated securitisation exposures that satisfy the operational requirements for external credit assessments, ANZ calculates credit risk regulatory capital based upon the ratings assigned by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Services and/or Fitch Ratings as appropriate, seniority of the securitisation exposure and the tenor of the securitisation exposure."}
{"context": "If ERBA is not applicable, ANZ adopts the Supervisory Formula Approach (SFA) for securitisation exposures. In this case, the credit risk regulatory capital calculation takes into account the type and performance of the underlying assets of the securitisation and the credit support provided to the securitisation exposure."}
{"context": "In relation to securitisation of ANZ originated assets, where:"}
{"context": "the significant credit risk transfer requirements have been satisfied under APS 120, ANZ is not required to hold credit risk regulatory capital for the underlying assets of the securitisation, however credit risk regulatory capital is calculated for the facilities provided to the securitisation;"}
{"context": "in absence of significant credit risk transfer being satisfied under APS 120, ANZ holds credit risk regulatory capital for the underlying assets of the securitisation however the credit risk regulatory capital for facilities provided to the securitisation is not calculated."}
{"context": "Chapter 6 outlines regulatory capital treatment for securitisation exposures held in ANZ’s trading book. In addition, the operational requirements for the recognition of external credit assessments outlined in APS 120 also apply to these exposures."}
{"context": "38 For example, various types of analysis including quantitative analysis of credit enhancements are performed for non-externally rated transactions. Factors such as geography, facility/transaction type and ANZ’s role will determine the applicable CRM techniques to apply. 39"}
{"context": "Exposures are classified into either the trading book or the banking book. In general terms, the trading book consists of positions in financial instruments and commodities held with trading intent or in order to hedge other elements of the trading book, and the banking book contains all other exposures. Banking book exposures are typically held to maturity, in contrast to the shorter term, trading nature of the trading book."}

{"context": "Accounting policies"}
{"context": "A key consideration in determining the treatment of transactions involving ANZ assets is whether the securitisation special purpose vehicles (SPVs) should be consolidated under AASB 10: Consolidated Financial Statements. If these SPVs meet the criteria for consolidation, the assets remain on ANZ’s balance sheet and are classified and valued in accordance with AASB 9: Financial Instruments. Currently, transactions with all of ANZ’s securitisation SPVs are treated as financing transactions. Securitisation services based on customer’s generated assets include warehouse and term fund facilities which are treated as loans."}
{"context": "For synthetic securitisations of ANZ originated assets, any transferred credit exposure is recognised through the fair value measurement of the credit derivative established within the structure."}
{"context": "For full details of the principal accounting policies governing ANZ’s securitisation activities are outlined in ANZ’s 2019 Annual Report, Notes to the Financial Statements. These include the valuation, derecognition, consolidation and income recognition principles outlined in the accounting policies and key judgements and estimates disclosures in each relevant note. Note 27 – Structured Entities and Note 28 – Transfers of Financial Assets also provides details about the nature of ANZ’s securitisation activities and certain accounting policies as they specifically apply to these activities. The impact of the application of these policies to securitisation activities have not changed since the prior year, notwithstanding the introduction of AASB 9: Financial Instruments which replaces AASB 139: Financial Recognition and Measurement from 1 October 2018."}
{"context": "To the extent that ANZ has exposures intended to be securitised, they could reside in either the banking or trading book."}
{"context": "To the extent that ANZ has entered into contractual arrangements that could require it to provide financial support for securitised assets e.g. liquidity facilities, these are recognised in accordance with the accounting policies set out in ANZ’s 2019 Annual Report."}

{"context": "ANZ’s traded market risk management framework incorporates a risk measurement approach to quantify the magnitude of market risk within trading books. This approach and related analysis identifies the range of possible outcomes that can be expected over a given period of time and establishes the relative likelihood of those outcomes."}
{"context": "ANZ’s key tools to measure and manage traded market risk on a daily basis are VaR, sensitivity measures and stress tests. VaR is calculated using a historical simulation with a 500 day observation period for standard VaR, and a one- year stressed period for stressed VaR. Traded VaR is calculated at a 99% confidence level for both standard VaR and Stressed VaR. Standard VaR is calculated over both a one-day and a ten-day holding period, while Stressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day holding period."}
{"context": "ANZ also undertakes a wide range of stress tests on the Group trading portfolio and to individual trading portfolios. Standard stress tests are applied daily measuring the potential loss that could arise from the largest market movements observed since 2008 over specific holding periods. Holding periods used to calculate stress parameters differ and reflect the relative liquidity of each product type. Results from stress testing on plausible severe scenarios are also calculated daily."}
{"context": "VaR and stress tests are supplemented by loss limits and detailed control limits. Loss limits are designed to ensure that in the event of continued losses from a trading activity, the trading activity is stopped and senior management reviews before trading resumed. Where necessary, detailed control limits such as sensitivity or position limits are also in place to ensure appropriate control is exercised over a specific risk or product."}
{"context": "Comparison of VaR estimates to gains/losses"}
{"context": "Back testing involves comparing VaR calculations with corresponding profit and loss to identify how often trading losses exceed the calculated VaR. For APRA back testing purposes, VaR is calculated at the 99% confidence interval with a one-day holding period."}
{"context": "Back testing is conducted daily, and outliers are analysed to determine whether they are the result of trading decisions, systemic changes in market conditions or issues related to the VaR model (historical data or model calibration)."}
{"context": "ANZ uses actual and hypothetical profit and loss data. Hypothetical data is designed to remove the impacts of intraday trading and sales margins. It is calculated as the difference between the value of the prior day portfolio at prior day closing rates and the value at current day closing rates. Markets Finance calculates actual profit and loss while Market Risk calculates hypothetical profit and loss."}

{"context": "Interest Rate Sensitivity - this is an estimate of the change in economic value of the banking book due to a 1 basis point move in a specific part of the yield curve."}
{"context": "Earnings at risk (EaR) - this is an estimate of the amount of income that is at risk from interest rate movements over a given holding period, expressed to a 97.5% level of statistical confidence."}
{"context": "Value at risk (VaR) - this is an estimate of the impact of interest rate changes on the banking book’s market value, expressed to a 99% level of statistical confidence for a given holding period."}
{"context": "Market Value loss limits - this mitigates the potential for embedded losses within the banking book."}
{"context": "Stress testing - standard extraordinary forward looking and repricing term assumptions tests are used to highlight potential risk which may not be captured by VaR, and how the portfolio might behave under extraordinary circumstances."}
{"context": "The calculations used to quantify IRRBB require assumptions to be made about the repricing term of exposures that do not have a contractually defined repricing date, such as deposits with no set maturity dates, and prepayments. Changes to these assumptions require GALCO approval."}
{"context": "Basis and optionality risks are measured using Monte Carlo simulation techniques, to generate a theoretical worst outcome at a specified confidence level (typically no less than at a 99% level of statistical confidence) less the average outcome."}
{"context": "Reporting of interest rate risk in the banking book"}
{"context": "Market Risk analyses the output of ANZ’s VaR, EaR and Stress Testing calculations daily. Compliance with the risk appetite and limit framework is reported to CMRC, GALCO and the Board Risk Committee."}

These combine parallel shocks with twists and bends in the curve to produce a wide range of hypothetical scenarios at high statistical confidence levels, with the single worst scenario identified and reported. Other stress tests include interest rate moves from historical periods of stress possible future stress test as well as stresses to assumptions made about the repricing term of exposures. The extraordinary rate move scenarios include rate changes over the stressed periods in financial market history. Forward looking stress tests include interest rate moves from plausible future severe scenarios.

{"context": "CVA charge is an additional capital requirement under Basel III for bilateral derivative exposures. Derivatives not cleared through a central exchange/counterparty are subject to this additional capital charge and also receive normal CRWA treatment under Basel II principles."}
{"context": "Collectively assessed provisions for credit impairment represent the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculated in accordance with AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9). These incorporate forward looking information and do not require an actual loss event to have occurred for an impairment provision to be recognised."}

{"context": "The risk of financial loss resulting from a counterparty failing to fulfil its obligations, or from a decrease in credit quality of a counterparty resulting in a loss in value."}
{"context": "Over the life of a derivative instrument, ANZ uses a CVA model to adjust fair value to take into account the impact of counterparty credit quality. The methodology calculates the present value of expected losses over the life of the financial instrument as a function of probability of default, loss given default, expected credit risk exposure and an asset correlation factor. Impaired derivatives are also subject to a CVA."}
{"context": "The number of days a credit obligation is overdue, commencing on the date that the arrears or excess occurs and accruing for each completed calendar day thereafter."}
{"context": "Exposure At Default is defined as the expected facility exposure at the date of default."}
{"context": "Facilities are classified as impaired when there is doubt as to whether the contractual amounts due, including interest and other payments, will be met in a timely manner. Impaired assets include impaired facilities, and impaired derivatives. Impaired derivatives have a credit valuation adjustment (CVA), which is a market assessment of the credit risk of the relevant counterparties."}
{"context": "Impaired loans comprise of drawn facilities where the customer’s status is defined as impaired."}
{"context": "Individual provision charge is the amount of expected credit losses on financial instruments assessed for impairment on an individual basis (as opposed to on a collective basis). It takes into account expected cash flows over the lives of those financial instruments."}
{"context": "Individually assessed provisions for credit impairment are calculated in accordance with AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9). They are assessed on a case-by-case basis for all individually managed impaired assets taking into consideration factors such as the realisable value of security (or other credit mitigants), the likely return available upon liquidation or bankruptcy, legal uncertainties, estimated costs involved in recovery, the market price of the exposure in secondary markets and the amount and timing of expected receipts and recoveries."}

ANZ has grouped market risk into two broad categories to facilitate the measurement, reporting and control of market risk:"}
{"context": "Traded market risk - the risk of loss from changes in the value of financial instruments due to movements in price factors for both physical and derivative trading positions. Trading positions arise from transactions where ANZ acts as principal with customers, financial exchanges or inter- bank counterparties."}
{"context": "Non-traded market risk (or balance sheet risk) - comprises interest rate risk in the banking book and the risk to the AUD denominated value of ANZ’s capital and earnings due to foreign exchange rate movements."}
{"context": "The risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events including legal risk but excluding reputation risk."}
{"context": "Facilities where a contractual payment has not been met or the customer is outside of contractual arrangements are deemed past due. Past due facilities include those operating in excess of approved arrangements or where scheduled repayments are outstanding but do not include impaired assets."}
{"context": "QCCP is a central counterparty which is an entity that interposes itself between counterparties to derivative contracts. Trades with QCCP attract a more favorable risk weight calculation."}
{"context": "Payments received and taken to profit for the current period for the amounts written off in prior financial periods."}
{"context": "Restructured items comprise facilities in which the original contractual terms have been modified for reasons related to the financial difficulties of the customer. Restructuring may consist of reduction of interest, principal or other payments legally due, or an extension in maturity materially beyond those typically offered to new facilities with similar risk."}
{"context": "Assets (both on and off-balance sheet) are risk weighted according to each asset’s inherent potential for default and what the likely losses would be in the case of default. In the case of non-asset backed risks (i.e. market and the capital operational risk), RWA requirements for those risks by 12.5."}
{"context": "is determined by multiplying"}
{"context": "The risk of credit related losses greater than expected due to a securitisation failing to operate as anticipated, or of the values and risks accepted or transferred, not emerging as expected."}
{"context": "Facilities are written off against the related provision for impairment when they are assessed as partially or fully uncollectable, and after proceeds from the realisation of any collateral have been received. Where individual provisions recognised in previous periods have subsequently decreased or are no longer required, such impairment losses are reversed in the current period income statement."}
