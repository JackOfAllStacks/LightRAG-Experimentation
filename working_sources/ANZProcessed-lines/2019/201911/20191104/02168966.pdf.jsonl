{"context": "COVER STORY"}
{"context": "Supporting drought affected communities in rural Australia"}
{"context": "Brian and Heather Coxon established BJ & HD Coxon Oyster Farmers in 1985 – a time when stocks were plentiful and business was booming. Since that time, the business has faced some difficult times."}
{"context": "An ANZ customer for 10 years, Brian has appreciated the bank’s support through those times. “During the algae bloom in 2010 I went to ANZ and pleaded relief. We did not know when things would pick up. I am grateful for ANZ sticking with us through that time”."}
{"context": "Brian recently found himself seeking the assistance of one of those agencies, reaching out to the Rural Financial Counselling Services (Southern NSW). The service, which is free, supports rural businesses through ongoing drought, poor production or anything else affecting their business and their life."}
{"context": "Fast forward to 2019 and Brian’s business is once again facing difficulties, this time as a result of the drought impacting much of Australia."}
{"context": "“When you’re doing it tough it’s all too hard, and the state you are in does not always lead to rational decisions,” says Brian. “The financial counsellor looks at you as a person, as well as a business.”"}
{"context": "“Oyster farming needs fresh water,” says Brian. “Famine on the land means famine in the sea. The oysters have poor growth, it’s difficult to maintain their condition and they’re harder to sell.”"}
{"context": "Last year in response to the drought ANZ donated $500,000 to the Financial Counselling Foundation for use by rural counselling agencies working in drought affected communities."}
{"context": "Brian looks forward to building up the business again, but he doubts things will ever be as good as they were in 1985. “This business is mostly about loving the lifestyle. People who want to be on the water and love working outdoors in Australia’s oldest aquaculture industry.”"}

{"context": "DAVID GONSKI, AC"}
{"context": "Challenging conditions continued in 2019 and our statutory profit of $6.0 billion was down 7% on the previous year. Cash profit from continuing operations (which excludes non-core items and the discontinued Wealth businesses from statutory profit) was $6.5 billion, flat when compared with the same time last year."}
{"context": "Despite those tough conditions, we held our FY19 full year dividend at 160 cents with the final dividend of 80 cents franked at 70%."}
{"context": "We recognise how important the dividend, franking and predictability is to shareholders. The Board’s decision to reduce franking to a new base reflects the changed shape of our business and the earnings in our Australian geography."}
{"context": "This has been a difficult year for us and Australian banks generally. Intense competition, slow credit growth and increased regulation have combined with lower consumer confidence to create this."}
{"context": "While this is reflected in our financial performance – particularly within our Australian Retail and Commercial business – the actions taken in recent years to improve the structure of our bank has us well-placed to meet the industry’s challenges."}
{"context": "4"}
{"context": "These actions include returning our Institutional business to profitable growth as well as the progress we have made to simplify the products and services we offer our retail customers in Australia and New Zealand."}
{"context": "We started early on our simplification agenda and this work continued throughout the year. Simplification continues to underpin improvement across ANZ."}
{"context": "A major milestone was the completion of the sale of our Life Insurance business in Australia to Zurich Financial Services Australia and we have also made significant progress in the sale of our Pensions & Investments business to IOOF. Subject to approval from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), we expect to complete this transaction in the first quarter of 2020."}
{"context": "Another highlight was the sale of some of our non-core assets outside of home markets, including our retail banking joint venture in Cambodia, our retail business in Papua New Guinea and our Life Insurance business in New Zealand. This continues the stronger focus on investments and resources in our core strategic retail and commercial businesses in Australia and New Zealand and our Institutional business in Asia Pacific."}
{"context": "Unfortunately there have also been challenges. This year we have announced an additional charge of $682 million as a result of an increase in our provisions for remediation work. While our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Shayne Elliott addresses this in his CEO message, I want to assure shareholders that the Board understands the impact fixing the failures of the past has on shareholders and we are working proactively and as quickly as possible to remediate impacted customers."}
{"context": "Our self-assessment"}
{"context": "During the year, APRA asked a range of banks, superannuation funds and insurance companies to take a closer look at their own behaviour and operations."}
{"context": "There has been some attention given to the fact ANZ has not released its self-assessment. APRA requested these self-assessments on a confidential basis to ensure institutions responded in a way that was full and frank. We have respected that request, noting particularly the fact that people contributed openly to the process on that basis and we will continue to do so. To assist those interested in our self-assessment we have published a summary which can be found on bluenotes at anz.com."}
{"context": "The self-assessment was a useful exercise where we identified many critical issues across culture, accountability and governance. As we outlined to APRA, the Board and executive team are determined to use this as an opportunity to deepen our self-awareness and to learn from our failings. Importantly, we do not see this as just a compliance measure but as an opportunity to make ANZ a more efficient, more sustainable bank."}
{"context": "We will be a simpler, less complex bank once we have implemented our road map for change."}
{"context": "We will have fewer products and more effective systems and processes. For customers, we will be easier to deal with and when things do go wrong we will be faster to resolve them."}
{"context": "Critically, our regulator will recognise issues identified in our annual attestation are being resolved in a timelier manner and this will flow through to improvements in our comprehensive review."}
{"context": "Executive remuneration"}
{"context": "ANZ recorded its ‘first strike’ last year when around 34% of shares were voted against our Remuneration Report. The Board took this result very seriously and shareholders will note there has been a significant differentiation this year in the remuneration awarded to our Disclosed Executives. Our Chair of the Human Resources Committee, Ilana Atlas, provides more detail in the Remuneration Report."}
{"context": "You will note our CEO despite a solid personal performance, has had his remuneration impacted by the broader performance of the Group. In fact, variable remuneration for our Disclosed Executives ranged between 0 and 74% of maximum opportunity. We also enhanced our approach to accountability and consequence management during the year and will continue to hold people to account who fail to meet our standards."}
{"context": "Capital management"}
{"context": "We continued our focus on capital efficiency this year by returning excess capital to shareholders as a result of our simplification agenda. We did this while also maintaining capital levels above APRA’s ‘unquestionably strong’ requirements. In the financial year of 2019 we reduced shares on issue by 42 million (equivalent of $1.1 billion) as part of our $3 billion buy-back. That program concluded in March 2019."}
{"context": "Outlook"}
{"context": "While the Australian housing market is slowly recovering, we expect challenging trading conditions to continue for the foreseeable future."}
{"context": "Record low interest rates in Australia and global trade tensions will continue to place pressure on earnings while increased compliance and remediation costs will be closely managed."}
{"context": "Competition will also remain in focus with the recently announced inquiry into mortgage pricing. We have acknowledged we have not always done a good job in explaining our position and hope the inquiry enables the opportunity to provide facts on a complex matter."}
{"context": "On the regulatory front, both APRA and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand have announced proposals that could lift the amount of capital required to support our New Zealand subsidiary. The final impact of these changes depend on a number of factors. This includes the outcome of consultation, particularly the amount of capital required, the time allowed to achieve it, and the instruments we are permitted to use."}
{"context": "Management will maintain its focus on capital efficiency. However, our strong ongoing capital generation capacity will assist in meeting any additional capital requirements."}
{"context": "Despite the industry’s challenges, I’m confident we have the team, the balance sheet and the oversight in place to execute effectively against a strategy that will benefit all our stakeholders. On behalf of the Board and myself, I thank our more than 39,000 people for their hard work in supporting our customers and our shareholders."}
{"context": "David Gonski, AC CHAIRMAN"}
{"context": "5"}
{"context": "CEO’s message"}
{"context": "SHAYNE ELLIOTT"}
{"context": "This has been a challenging year of slow economic growth, increased competition, regulatory change and global uncertainty."}
{"context": "Our progress"}
{"context": "The core of our strategy has not changed. Put simply, we will generate decent returns by improving the financial wellbeing of our customers."}
{"context": "This year we continued to focus on balance sheet strength, improve our culture, simplify the business and rebuild our team’s capabilities. In doing this, we significantly reduced the cost and risk of operating the bank despite the strong headwinds facing the sector."}
{"context": "We are determined to have the right people who listen, learn and adapt. We will put the best tools and insights into the hands of our customers and people. Importantly, we will concentrate our efforts on those particular things that add value to customers – and do them right the first time."}
{"context": "This means we must continue to simplify our business, improve our customer proposition and invest in innovations that deliver better customer outcomes and improve the efficiency of our operations."}
{"context": "Retail and commercial in Australia had a difficult year. Increased remediation charges, intense competition and record low interest rates have had a significant impact on earnings."}
{"context": "6"}
{"context": "While yet to flow through to the balance sheet, management actions and operational improvements have seen a steady recovery in home loan applications in recent months. These volume improvements are expected to be maintained into 2020."}
{"context": "New Zealand delivered a solid underlying result in a more competitive environment. As in Australia, compliance and remediation costs contributed to higher operating expenses, while a focus on operational efficiency offset inflation in business-as-usual expenses."}
{"context": "There are challenges ahead in New Zealand, particularly in relation to the amount of capital we may be required to hold. However, we are well-advanced in our preparations to manage these proposed impacts in an orderly way."}
{"context": "Institutional continued its transformation with a return to profitable growth. While macro conditions had an impact on financial performance in the second half, the business is now generating returns above our cost of capital that provides important diversification given the lower growth in our home markets."}
{"context": "Customer remediation"}
{"context": "The Royal Commission highlighted many failures the Australian banks needed to quickly remedy. ANZ is not immune from this challenge."}
{"context": "This year we announced an additional charge of $682 million as a result of an increase in our provisions for remediation work. We know this is real money and has a real impact on shareholders. But we also know it’s important to fix the mistakes of the past and return money owed to customers as quickly as possible."}
{"context": "We are currently resolving identified fee or interest discrepancies with over 3.4 million Australia Retail and Commercial customers. To date our Responsible Banking team has remediated over one million customer accounts."}
{"context": "If there is a positive from this work, it is that much of the time and resources being invested in remediating our systems and processes will make us a better bank for our customers and shareholders. It means the mistakes of the past are unlikely to be repeated and when issues arise they will be easier to fix."}
{"context": "Customers and community"}
{"context": "Our purpose of shaping a world where people and communities thrive guides our decisions. An example of this is the program we have in place to proactively contact more than one million customers to help them get more value from our products and services, including those eligible for Centrelink or Veterans’ Affairs benefits or those with persistent credit card debt. This is to make sure customers are using the best products given their individual circumstances and that they are aware of all the options available."}
{"context": "Another issue we care about is providing affordable and sustainable housing for Australians and New Zealanders. We do this by encouraging investment in the sector – including our role leading the largest social bond issuance for housing in Australia."}
{"context": "We also know we have a role in enhancing environmental sustainability and we are focusing our efforts on energy, water and waste."}
{"context": "We have committed to fund and facilitate $50 billion by 2025 towards sustainable solutions for our customers, including initiatives that help improve environmental sustainability, increase access to affordable housing and promote financial wellbeing."}
{"context": "This is not philanthropy. It’s really good business for our customers and shareholders given the growth opportunities available in the sector. It’s also a business we are good at given our network and capabilities and an area we expect to grow rapidly in the coming years as the world grapples with environmental challenges."}
{"context": "Changing how we reward our people"}
{"context": "This year we introduced wide-ranging reforms to the way we pay people. Variable remuneration is now a smaller part of our people’s take-home pay and these reduced bonuses are determined by the overall performance of the bank."}
{"context": "This is not about paying our people less. It is an industry-leading initiative that will positively enhance our culture and become an important point of differentiation. It also addresses the negative impact an over-emphasis on individual bonuses within a bank can have on customers and the community."}
{"context": "Redesigning how we reward our staff was one of the 16 key initiatives we announced as part of our initial response to the Royal Commission recommendations. As part of this, we also strengthened our accountability frameworks to ensure there are appropriate consequences for the small number of people who do not meet standards of behaviour or performance."}
{"context": "Finally, despite this difficult environment, we have made good progress this year and I’d like to thank the more than 39,000 people who turn up for ANZ and work hard every day for our customers. I’m confident we have the right strategy and team to deliver great, sustainable results in the future for our customers, our shareholders and the community."}

John had not transacted on the card since 2016 and had been making payments only slightly above the minimum monthly repayment amount."}

Also, it should create opportunities for business to leverage their expertise, experience and technology into new areas to serve their customers. Businesses that engage with the data sector will have the opportunity to offer better services, and a more precise product to meet customer needs. Their customers should have the opportunity to benefit from enhanced choice and convenience. The efficient use of data, in a secure ecosystem with a strong governance structure, could be tremendously beneficial for businesses and customers alike.”"}

{"context": "The housing market activity is improving off the back of the lower interest rates, and the removal of investor and interest only lending caps, but it is too soon to call a recovery."}
{"context": "Businesses remain cautious and are taking a ‘wait and see’ approach with the economy. Investment continues to be below long- term averages."}
{"context": "Momentum has returned in home lending with applications up 34% in the second half of 2019 (compared with the first half ), through improving turnaround times and greater clarity on lending policies, adjustments to lending caps and a major marketing campaign to restore confidence across our distribution channels. We are confident this will flow through to settlements."}

{"context": "The home loan portfolio, down 3%, was affected by slowing system credit growth, competition and more conservative home loan origination risk settings. Commercial Lending, also down 2%, was driven by lower volumes in Small Business Banking."}

{"context": "While the operating conditions were more challenging, Retail and Commercial both delivered balance sheet growth in 2019. Retail net loans and advances were up 4% (driven by Home Loan growth), and Commercial lending up 2%. Revenue for the division was however impacted by margin pressure from lower deposit margins and home loan mix changes."}

Appropriate consequences should reflect the severity of the issue and may include, for example, one or more of the following: coaching, counselling, formal warnings, impacts to performance and remuneration outcomes, impacts on promotion, application of malus and ultimately termination of employment for the most serious issues."}

MoneyMinded taught her about prioritising her spending and deciphering between ‘needs and wants’."}
{"context": "MoneyMinded has also changed her attitude to money. Taghrid is careful with her money, but she is also finding alternatives so she and her family are not missing out on enjoying life."}
{"context": "“I’m not cutting anything, I’m not suffering. But at the same time, if I need something, I have money to buy it in a different way. I cut my coffee, but I enrolled in a gym,” she said."}
{"context": "She also learned about the value of having ‘emergency money’. Since completing MoneyMinded Taghrid regularly transfers $50 into a specific savings account, ‘just like paying a bill’. With these savings she was able to buy a replacement car when hers broke down – before MoneyMinded she would have been without a car for several months."}
{"context": "Taghrid has clear financial goals now too – a short-term goal of saving for materials for her business and a longer-term goal for her family to buy a home."}

{"context": "Public policy debate"}
{"context": "It is important that we are a part of the communities in which we operate, and we provide many opportunities for our people to get involved through our community programs – volunteering, funding and participating in community projects, or donating through workplace giving."}
{"context": "We seek to contribute constructively to policy debate and understand the perspectives of our community’s elected representatives, policy makers and regulators. We contribute to debate on business, economic, social and environmental issues affecting our customers and shareholders."}
{"context": "The strength of our relationships with partners in the not-for-profit sector is key to our ability to support the delivery of much needed services to the community. Many of our partners work in areas aligned to our priority areas of financial wellbeing, housing and environmental sustainability."}
{"context": "We work in a collaborative and open way as members of associations that have similar interests and approaches to ours."}
{"context": "In 2019 our key membership payments were:"}

{"context": "$40,250"}
{"context": "Workplace giving"}
{"context": "Our workplace giving program enables employees in Australia to make contributions to around 30 charity partners through regular pre-tax payroll deductions. This year we introduced ‘double matching’ – for every dollar donated by an employee (up to $5,000 per employee in a tax year) through the program, ANZ donates two dollars."}
{"context": "Payment to the Australian Banking Association includes our annual fee as well as expenditure related to communications activity, contribution to the establishment of a not-for-profit Debt Repayment Service, industry initiatives in response to the Royal Commission’s work, and industry reform activity such as the new Banking Code of Practice."}
{"context": "Public policy advocacy"}
{"context": "Our employees in New Zealand and Fiji can also donate through payroll to their respective staff foundations (charitable trusts that provide small grants) and ANZ double matches donations."}
{"context": "We understand that some of our stakeholders are particularly interested in positions we hold on issues such as data security, privacy and climate change and our membership of industry associations that undertake advocacy on these issues."}
{"context": "Volunteering"}
{"context": "Our Volunteer Leave Policy, which applies to permanent, regular and fixed-term employees provides for at least one day of paid volunteer leave each year."}
{"context": "It is not the role of any association to represent solely ANZ’s, nor any other single member’s view. It is also not possible for industry associations to obtain a consensus on every issue. There is sometimes disagreement amongst members about the final positions taken by industry associations and even if we do not agree with it, we will participate in discussions. From time to time, we may take positions on certain matters not supported by the relevant industry association. For example, ANZ was the first major bank to support a ‘last resort’ compensation scheme for victims of misconduct. Such a scheme is now public policy."}

{"context": "Improving access to social and affordable housing for those most in need"}
{"context": "This year ANZ arranged bonds for both Australia’s National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (NHFIC) and Housing New Zealand Corporation (HNZ), aimed at increasing access and availability of social and affordable housing on both sides of the Tasman."}
{"context": "Well received by investors, the bonds – a A$315 million social bond for NHFIC and two wellbeing bonds for HNZ (NZ$500 million and NZ$600 million) – set benchmarks as the first ever capital markets issue for NHFIC and the first wellbeing bonds for HNZ."}
{"context": "According to ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott, “One of the areas in which we can impact the community is in the area of housing. This is not about charitable works, it’s about bringing the full force of ANZ, one of the largest financial institutions in the country to bear; to have an impact and to shape the world for good.”"}
{"context": "A relatively new type of financing, social bonds are structured so the proceeds fund a social purpose. In this case, owning a NHFIC or HNZ bond is an indirect investment into Australia and New Zealand’s social and affordable housing sector. The return is based on the credit-worthiness of the borrower who is responsible for directing the financing to social causes, with an obligation to report accordingly."}
{"context": "Partnering with NHFIC and HNZ allowed ANZ to join forces and draw on each organisation’s expertise in order to deliver better outcomes for a range of stakeholders."}
{"context": "Left to right: Nathan Dal Bon – Chief Executive Officer, National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation, Caryn Kakas – Head of Housing Strategy, Group Strategy, ANZ and Tessa Dann – Associate Director, Sustainable Finance, ANZ."}

{"context": "Our progress"}
{"context": "This year we have continued to strengthen our risk management capabilities, focusing on:"}
{"context": "Our Risk Management Framework"}
{"context": "The Board is responsible for establishing and overseeing the Group’s risk management framework. The Board has delegated authority to the Board Risk Committee (BRC) to develop and monitor compliance with the Group’s risk management policies. The Committee reports regularly to the Board on its activities."}
{"context": "Culture and conduct • We have initiated a programme of work to build out how we will measure, monitor and manage conduct risk to allow us to better understand and respond to the drivers of poor conduct. This has included introducing new accountability and consequence principles for employees found accountable for material failure and non-compliance as well as recognising positive risk behaviours in our annual performance and remuneration reviews."}
{"context": "We have raised employee awareness about our whistleblower processes and made it easier for them to ‘speak up’– including through initiatives such as the inaugural Whistleblower Awareness Week this year. Simplification • Investment has been made in our risk systems, including"}

{"context": "the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS), which sets out the Board’s expectations regarding the degree of risk that the Group is prepared to accept in pursuing its strategic objectives and its operating plan; and"}

The RMS includes: a description of each material risk; and an overview of how the RMF addresses each risk, with reference to the relevant policies, standards and procedures. It also includes information on how the Group identifies, measures, evaluates, monitors, reports and then either controls or mitigates material risks. The Group operates a Three Lines-of-Defence Model in regard to risk management that helps embed a culture where risk is everyone’s responsibility. The business – as the first line of defence – has day to day ownership of risks and controls and is accountable for identifying and managing its own risks. The Risk Function is the second line of defence, providing a strong and independent oversight of the work undertaken to manage the risk, as well as developing and maintaining the Risk Management Framework."}
{"context": "Non-financial risk • We have redesigned our non-financial risk framework in response to feedback that it was too complex. Significant work has been undertaken to simplify our language around operational risk, consolidate our framework documentation, and clarify the requirements and roles and responsibilities of our staff."}
{"context": "The final line of defence is Internal Audit and includes independent assurance that evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of both first and second line risk management approaches."}
{"context": "We have established a Royal Commission and Self-Assessment Oversight Group to provide oversight of the integrated approach and plans to address the Self-Assessment focus areas and Royal Commission ‘lessons’. This includes, for example, commissioning and reviewing reports on progress in addressing the Self- Assessment focus areas, our 16 Royal Commission commitments and actions by government to respond to the Royal Commission."}

{"context": "CUSTOMER STORY Sustainable finance market continues to grow"}
{"context": "Following the growth of green bonds in the past three to four years, the Australian and New Zealand sustainable finance market continues to accelerate with the emergence of loans in both green and sustainability-linked formats."}
{"context": "These loans are differentiated by how the proceeds are used. Green loans require borrowers to invest in ‘green’ assets such as green buildings, renewable energy or low carbon transport projects. Sustainability-linked loans can be used for general corporate purposes with pricing designed to incentivise improved sustainability performance – for example, reducing emissions and improving employee wellbeing."}
{"context": "In the past year, ANZ has arranged and funded the first ever sustainability linked loan in Australia for Adelaide Airport, and the first Climate Bonds Initiative certified green loan in Australia for Investa Commercial Property Fund."}
{"context": "We also acted as joint sustainability co-ordinator and bookrunner on a $1.4 billion sustainability-linked loan for Sydney Airport – the first syndicated facility of its kind in Australia as well as the largest in Asia Pacific and the airport sector to date. Pricing of the loan is attached to Sydney Airport’s ESG performance, as measured by an independent third party. Sustainability initiatives include investment in electric vehicles, an ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025 and cutting carbon emissions per passenger by 50 percent from 2010 levels by 2025."}
{"context": "In a first for the New Zealand market, we also led the successful completion of a NZ$50 million sustainability-linked loan for dairy company Synlait Milk Ltd."}
{"context": "“Linking our financial arrangements to our ESG performance made perfect sense”, said Nigel Greenwood, Synlait Chief Financial Officer. “It reinforces to our shareholders and stakeholders that we are committed to continuously improving our performance and disclosure, and aligns with our company purpose.”"}
{"context": "ANZ expects companies will become more receptive to these types of sustainable finance products as climate change and sustainable development move into the fore of their corporate strategies and risk assessment."}

{"context": "When calculating policy liabilities, the projected future cash flows on insurance contracts are discounted to reflect the present value of the obligation, with the impact of changes in the market discount rate each period being reflected in the Income Statement. ANZ includes the impact on the re-measurement of insurance contracts attributable to changes in market discount rates as an adjustment to statutory profit to remove the volatility attributable to changes in market interest rates which reverts to zero over the life of insurance contracts. With the sale completion of the OnePath Life (NZ) Ltd business, the 2019 financial year includes the reversal of life-to-date cash profit adjustments on the revaluation of policy liabilities sold increasing cash profit by $81 million. The Group enters into economic hedges to manage its interest rate and foreign exchange risk which, in accordance with accounting standards, result in fair value gains and losses being recognised within the Income Statement. ANZ removes the fair value adjustments from cash profit since the profit or loss resulting from the hedge transactions will reverse over time to match with the profit or loss from the economically hedged item as part of cash profit. This includes gains and losses arising from approved classes of derivatives not designated in accounting hedge relationships but which are considered to be economic hedges, including hedges of foreign currency debt issuances and foreign exchange denominated revenue and expense streams, primarily NZD and USD (and USD correlated), as well as ineffectiveness from designated accounting hedges. ANZ entered into a series of structured credit intermediation trades prior to the Global Financial Crisis with eight US financial guarantors. This involved selling credit default swaps (CDSs) as protection over specific debt structures and purchasing CDS protection over the same structures. ANZ has subsequently exited its positions with six US financial guarantors. The remaining two portfolios with a $0.3 billion notional value are being monitored with a view to reducing the exposures when ANZ deems it cost effective relative to the perceived risk associated with a specific trade or counterparty. On 3 January 2017, The Group announced that it had agreed to sell its 20% stake in Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank (SRCB). The impact of SRCB has been treated as an adjustment between statutory profit to cash profit. The rationale being the loss on reclassification to held for sale was expected to be largely offset by the release of reserve gains on sale completion within the 2017 year. The transaction was subsequently completed in the 2018 full year, and the entire impact of the transaction was recognised in cash profit."}

{"context": "Lending volumes decreased as a result of lower system growth, asset competition and more conservative home loan origination risk settings. Net interest margin decreased as a result of home loan mix changes and higher discounting, the impact of the official cash rate decreases on low-rate deposits, regulatory impact on credit card pricing and higher customer remediation, partially offset by home loans re-pricing. Other operating income decreased as the result of higher customer remediation, and lower fee income due to the removal of fees and lower volumes. Operating expenses were flat with higher inflation, higher compliance costs and increased technology infrastructure spend offset by productivity initiatives including workforce and branch optimisation. Credit impairment charges increased primarily due to an increase in collectively assessed credit impairment as a result of a weakening Australian economic outlook, partially offset by a higher recoveries and write-backs."}

Operating expenses decreased due to a reduction in FTE and related costs, and lower ongoing software amortisation charges, partially offset by inflation.

{"context": "New Zealand"}
{"context": "Lending and customer deposit volumes grew across all portfolios and funds under management increased during the period. Net interest margin decreased as a result of compressed deposit margins and home loan mix changes. Operating income decreased primarily due to the loss of income as the result of the OnePath Life (NZ) divestment, and an one-off insurance recovery in the prior period. Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher regulatory compliance spend, partly offset by the OnePath Life (NZ) divestment. Credit impairment charges increased primarily due to an increase in individually assessed impairment charges driven by lower write-backs and recoveries, and increase in collectively assessed impairment charges in Commercial driven by the release of an Agri economic cycle adjustment in 2018 followed by a new temporary overlay in 2019."}

The aligned dealer groups business consists of ADGs that operate under their own Australian Financial Services licences. The sale of the ADGs completed on 1 October 2018. On 17 October 2019 the Group announced it had agreed a revised sale price for its OnePath P&I business and ADG to IOOF of $850 million, being a $125 million reduction from the original sale price of $975 million announced in October 2017. The new price of $850 million, includes approximately $25 million that ANZ has already received for the sale of ADGs in October 2018. The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements. Subject to APRA approval the Group expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. The impact of the reduction in price has been reflected in the 2019 financial results."}

{"context": "Treasury shares adjustment"}
{"context": "ANZ shares held by the Group in Wealth Australia discontinued operations are deemed to be Treasury shares for accounting purposes. Dividends and realised and unrealised gains and losses from these shares are reversed as they are not permitted to be recognised as income for statutory reporting purposes. In deriving cash profit, these earnings are included to ensure there is no asymmetrical impact on the Group’s profits because the Treasury shares are held to support policy liabilities which are revalued through the Income Statement. With the sale completion of the life insurance business to Zurich, there are no further ANZ shares held by the Group in discontinued operations (2018: 15.5 million shares)."}
{"context": "Revaluation of policy liabilities"}
{"context": "When calculating policy liabilities, the projected future cash flows on insurance contracts are discounted to reflect the present value of the obligation, with the impact of changes in the market discount rate in each period being reflected in the Income Statement. ANZ includes the impact on the re-measurement of the insurance contract attributable to changes in market discount rates as an adjustment to statutory profit to remove the volatility attributable to changes in market interest rates which reverts to zero over the life of the insurance contract. With the sale completion of the life insurance business to Zurich, the 2019 financial year includes the reversal of the life-to-date cash profit adjustments on the revaluation of policy liabilities sold, reducing cash profit by $15 million."}

{"context": "1. BOARD RESPONSE TO FEEDBACK PROVIDED IN RELATION TO THE 2018 REMUNERATION REPORT"}
{"context": "At the AGM in 2018, while two thirds of shares voted were cast in favour of the Remuneration Report, one third were cast against and so ANZ recorded what is termed a ‘first strike’. The Board took this outcome very seriously and sought feedback from both our institutional and retail shareholders. A summary of the key feedback received and changes made this year is provided below."}
{"context": "SUMMARY"}
{"context": "Questions around whether variable remuneration is sufficiently variable and genuinely at risk. This was a particular focus in 2018 given the impact on ANZ of the Royal Commission and where ANZ recognised substantial customer remediation costs."}
{"context": "The Board has focused on ensuring that the 2019 variable remuneration awards appropriately reflect individual and overall performance outcomes."}
{"context": "At the start of each year, the Board sets performance objectives for the CEO and each of our Disclosed Executives that are intended to be stretching yet achievable. These contain a blend of both financial (weighted no more than 45%) and non-financial measures designed to focus executives on delivering sustainable long-term performance that supports both good customer and shareholder outcomes aligned to our long-term strategic objectives."}
{"context": "The CEO’s performance is assessed against a number of factors including the Group Performance Framework and individual strategic objectives. Although the Board assessed his performance as slightly below expectations, the Board exercised their discretion and applied a reduction to the CEO’s 2019 AVR outcome. This resulted in an award of 48% of maximum opportunity in recognition of the fact that as CEO he is ultimately accountable for overall performance."}
{"context": "This year’s VR outcomes for Disclosed Executives ranged from 0% to 74% (2018: 40% to 60%) and averaged 45% (2018: 51%) of maximum opportunity demonstrating the ‘at risk’ nature of variable remuneration. There is significant differentiation in outcomes – with two Disclosed Executives receiving less than 45% of maximum opportunity and one receiving no VR."}
{"context": "Include more rationale to help investors understand why the Board believes the remuneration outcomes are appropriate."}
{"context": "The variable remuneration structure and outcomes for the CEO and Disclosed Executives are the subject of considerable debate and evaluation by both the HR Committee and the Board. These decisions are not taken lightly or quickly."}
{"context": "In response to this feedback, the 2019 Remuneration Report aims to provide further clarity to help shareholders better understand both the process (how performance and remuneration outcomes are determined) and the rationale (why the Board believe this year’s outcomes are appropriate for the CEO and Disclosed Executives). Better explain how consequences are applied for executives for poor conduct/issues ‘on their watch’ that damaged customers and shareholders."}
{"context": "In 2019 we implemented a strengthened Accountability and Consequence Framework so that meaningful consequences are applied to executives and employees at all levels, where it is appropriate, for material risk events."}
{"context": "The Consequence Review Group (CRG), which is now chaired by the CEO, meets at least four times a year. The CRG reviews material risk events, and considers recommendations from each business regarding accountability and the application of consequences for significant Code of Conduct breaches and material risk and audit events. We have also expanded our disclosures in this report to provide more information on the number of employees where formal consequences have been applied in the 2019 financial year. See section 7."}
{"context": "The departure of the Group Executive and CEO, NZ was a clear and public example of the application of meaningful consequences this year. His employment ceased, he was paid no variable remuneration and all unvested deferred remuneration (~$7.4 million) was immediately forfeited. Use ‘face value’ rather than ‘fair value’ when determining the number of deferred share rights awarded to the CRO."}
{"context": "We have changed our approach and will award the CRO deferred share rights using the face value of the Company’s shares (rather than the fair value – which is the face value adjusted for the loss of dividends). In order to maintain the same opportunity value, the VR maximum opportunity percentage has been adjusted to 270% of fixed remuneration (previously 255%). This change maintains – it does not increase – the dollar value maximum opportunity, therefore the CRO would not receive greater VR for the same level of performance. Focus on maximum variable remuneration opportunity rather than target opportunity."}
{"context": "Variable remuneration outcomes are now primarily expressed as a percentage of maximum opportunity, and the value of performance rights shown using the face value of the rights at full (100%) vesting. This approach more clearly demonstrates the executives’ actual outcomes in comparison to the value they could be awarded if expectations were exceeded at the highest level. There is no change in practice or opportunity."}

{"context": "Four-year deferral: The deferral and performance period for the performance rights (excluding the CRO who receives deferred share rights) has been extended from three years to four years. This provides an additional year for the performance rights to remain at risk (subject to malus) and for the performance hurdles to be measured."}
{"context": "Vesting period: The deferred shares will be delivered over four years with staggered vesting (previously even vesting). See section 6.2."}
{"context": "For the CRO: The number of deferred share rights awarded will be determined using the face value (previously fair value), and these share rights will now be subject to a four-year deferral period (previously three years)."}
{"context": "The differing remuneration structure for the CRO is designed to preserve the independence of the role and to minimise any conflicts of"}
{"context": "interest in carrying out the risk control function across ANZ."}
{"context": "As a result of these changes, 68% of variable remuneration (AVR plus LTVR) for the CEO, 53% of VR for Disclosed Executives (other than the CRO), and 41% of VR for the CRO will be deferred for at least four years, noting that this is in excess of the BEAR minimum deferral requirement of 60% for the CEO and 40% for Disclosed Executives. See section 6.2 for more detail."}

Remuneration awarded includes any cash payments (e.g. fixed remuneration and cash variable remuneration) and the value of deferred shares and performance rights awarded for the year but which have not yet vested (i.e. the value which has not yet been received during the year). These tables also show the AVR/VR as a % of target and maximum opportunity – this % remains unchanged whether using the threshold or full vesting value of performance rights."}
{"context": "Fixed remuneration is largely unchanged year-on-year other than where executives have changed roles. Variable remuneration differs significantly both year-on-year and between different executives, and appropriately reflects the variability in Group and individual performance year-on-year.

{"context": "Performance"}
{"context": "With regard to AVR, the CEO is assessed 50% on the ANZ Group Performance Framework and 50% on achievement of individual strategic objectives aligned to ANZ’s strategy. Both the Group Performance Framework and individual strategic objectives are agreed by the Board at the start of the financial year and intended to be stretching."}
{"context": "Board assessment of performance on individual strategic objectives: Slightly Below Expectations"}
{"context": "The CEO consistently role modelled the ANZ culture and values in his actions throughout a challenging year for the banking sector. This included the content and manner of his testimony before the Royal Commission and also his handling of the Code of Conduct breach by the former Group Executive and CEO, NZ."}
{"context": "Weighting of financial metrics"}
{"context": "AVR: Financial metrics have a 35% weighting in the Group Performance Framework and therefore notionally have a 17.5% weighting in the CEO’s AVR. However, the CEO’s AVR is not formulaic – outcomes are moderated by the Risk and Reputation element of the Group Performance Framework and the Board’s judgement on the appropriate AVR considering all aspects of performance."}
{"context": "LTVR: 100% of the LTVR hurdles are based on TSR (both relative and absolute). ANZ’s view is that TSR is not purely a financial measure as it reflects a range of factors including investors’ judgement about the prospects of a company."}
{"context": "Work continued on rebuilding ANZ’s reputation following the Royal Commission last year. However, this was impacted by further remediation charges and challenges in our NZ business. In Australia Retail and Commercial, poor execution of changes to certain processes and procedures including technology transition saw customer loan assessment and approval times extend, leading to a loss of market share. Actions taken throughout mid calendar 2019 have improved these issues."}
{"context": "The CEO has continued to build on the key planks of the ANZ strategy – capital efficiency, productivity and simplification – to deliver long-term targeted growth. ANZ delivered a solid financial performance in 2019 – with capital well above APRA’s unquestionably strong Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) requirements, continued productivity savings and the completion of further asset/business disposals. While lending growth in the year was modest, delivery of the core aspects of the strategy positions ANZ well for the future."}
{"context": "At the end of the financial year, ANZ’s performance is assessed against the Group Performance Framework, and the CEO’s performance is assessed against his individual strategic objectives, the ANZ values (behaviours), delivery of the BEAR obligations and ANZ’s risk and compliance standards. In conducting the CEO’s performance assessment, the HR Committee seeks input from the Chairman, CRO (on risk management), CFO (on financial performance), Group Executive, Talent and Culture (GE T&C) (on talent and culture matters) and Group General Manager Internal Audit (GGM IA) (on internal audit matters)."}
{"context": "Around 25% of our people now work in new ways which is driving speed and productivity benefits. These changes are enhancing speed of delivery to customers and producing higher employee engagement results."}

Ongoing work to identify customers in need of remediation led to further remediation charges, which impacted financial performance."}

The Group uses cash profit as a measure of performance for the Group’s ongoing business activities, as this provides a basis to assess Group and Divisional performance against earlier periods and against peer institutions.

{"context": "Variable remuneration seeks to differentiate for performance and is designed to focus our CEO and Disclosed Executives on stretching performance objectives supporting our business strategy, and encourage the delivery of long-term stakeholder value."}
{"context": "The way variable remuneration operates differs somewhat between the CEO and Disclosed Executives. Namely:"}
{"context": "The CEO’s variable remuneration is comprised of AVR and LTVR (subject to shareholder approval), which provides consistency with external market practice, and LTVR reinforces his focus on achieving longer term strategic objectives and long-term stakeholder value creation."}
{"context": "Disclosed Executives are subject to one combined VR plan which enables us to: – provide the appropriate mix of short and long-term rewards (including performance hurdles) to drive performance, and attract and retain talent;"}
{"context": "By deferring a significant portion of variable remuneration (79% of maximum opportunity for the CEO, 75% for Disclosed Executives, 67% for the CRO and 40% for the Acting Group Executive and CEO, NZ), we seek to ensure alignment with shareholder interests to deliver on ANZ’s strategic objectives and ensure a focus on long-term value creation. Deferred variable remuneration has significant retention elements, and most importantly, can be adjusted downwards, including to zero, allowing the Board to hold executives accountable, individually or collectively, for the longer term impacts of their decisions and actions."}

Her VR will be delivered as 60% cash and 40% as shares deferred for four years (ensuring compliance with the BEAR)."}
{"context": "The remuneration mix is 27% fixed remuneration and 73% VR maximum opportunity.

{"context": "Deferred shares are ordinary shares, deferred over one to four years (deferred for four years for the Acting Group Executive and CEO, NZ). By deferring part of an executives’ remuneration over time (and it remaining subject to malus), we enable a substantial amount of their remuneration to be directly linked to delivering long-term shareholder value.

{"context": "Element"}
{"context": "Detail"}
{"context": "Performance rights hurdles"}
{"context": "The performance rights have TSR performance hurdles reflecting the importance of focusing on achieving longer term strategic objectives and aligning executives’ and shareholders’ interests. We will apply two TSR performance hurdles for the 2019 grants of performance rights:"}
{"context": "75% will be measured against a relative TSR hurdle, tranche 1."}
{"context": "25% will be measured against an absolute TSR hurdle, tranche 2."}
{"context": "TSR represents the change in value of a share plus the value of reinvested dividends paid. We regard it as the most appropriate long-term measure – it focuses on the delivery of shareholder value and is a well understood and tested mechanism to measure performance."}
{"context": "The combination of relative and absolute TSR hurdles provides balance to the plan by:"}
{"context": "Relative: rewarding executives for performance that exceeds that of comparator companies; and"}
{"context": "Absolute: ensuring there is a continued focus on providing positive growth – even when the market is declining."}
{"context": "The two hurdles measure separate aspects of performance:"}
{"context": "the relative TSR hurdle measures our TSR compared to that of the Select Financial Services comparator group, made up of core local and global competitors. This comparator group is chosen to broadly reflect the geographies and business segments in which ANZ competes for revenue; and"}
{"context": "the absolute Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) TSR hurdle provides executives with a more direct line of sight to the level of shareholder return to be achieved. It also provides a tighter correlation between the executives’ rewards and the shareholders’ financial outcomes."}
{"context": "We will measure ANZ’s TSR against each hurdle at the end of the four-year performance period to determine whether each tranche of performance rights become exercisable. We measure each tranche independently from the other – that is: one tranche may vest fully or partially but the other tranche may not vest."}
{"context": "Relative TSR hurdle for the 2019 grant"}
{"context": "The relative TSR hurdle is an external hurdle that measures our TSR against that of the Select Financial Services comparator group over four years. The Select Financial Services comparator group (unchanged from prior years) is made up of: Bank of Queensland Limited; Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited; Commonwealth Bank of Australia Limited; DBS Bank Limited; Macquarie Group Limited; National Australia Bank Limited; Standard Chartered PLC; Suncorp Group Limited; and Westpac Banking Corporation."}

{"context": "The Absolute CAGR TSR hurdle is an internal hurdle as to whether ANZ achieves or exceeds a threshold level of growth the Board sets at the start of the performance period."}
{"context": "The Board reviews and approves the absolute TSR targets each year for that year’s award. When reviewing the targets, the Board references ANZ’s assessed Cost of Capital. The Cost of Capital is determined using methodologies including the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The primary driver of the reduction in the Cost of Capital used in setting this year’s target is the reduction in the risk free rate (government bond yield) that has occurred in Australia and other developed economies in the last 12 months."}

{"context": "Calculating the number of performance rights"}
{"context": "The number of performance rights we grant is calculated using a face value basis – i.e. the full share price. Face value at full vesting is split into two tranches. Each tranche value is then divided by the market price (five trading day VWAP of ANZ shares at the start of the performance period) to determine the number of performance rights we award in each tranche."}
{"context": "Performance rights are allocated in November for Disclosed Executives and December for the CEO (subject to shareholder approval)."}
{"context": "Expensing performance rights"}
{"context": "ANZ engages PricewaterhouseCoopers to independently determine the fair value of performance rights, which is only used for expensing purposes. They consider factors including: the performance conditions, share price volatility, life of the instrument, dividend yield, and share price at grant date."}
{"context": "6.2.3b Deferred share rights – CRO (VR)"}
{"context": "The CRO receives deferred share rights instead of performance rights to preserve the independence of the role and to minimise any conflicts of interest in carrying out the risk control function across the organisation."}
{"context": "The CRO’s deferred share rights are subject to a time-based vesting hurdle of four years. The value the Board uses to determine the number of deferred share rights to be allocated to the CRO is the face value of the Company’s shares traded on the ASX at the time of grant (five trading day VWAP)."}
{"context": "6.3 MALUS (DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT OF PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED REMUNERATION) – BOARD DISCRETION"}
{"context": "All deferred remuneration we award to an employee is subject to ANZ’s on-going and absolute discretion to adjust this downward (malus) (including to zero) at any time."}
{"context": "ANZ may exercise this discretion, for example, where:"}
{"context": "there is a need to protect the financial soundness of ANZ or to meet regulatory requirements or there has been a material failure of risk management or controls within ANZ;"}
{"context": "the employee has acted fraudulently or dishonestly, failed to act with due care, skill and diligence, or failed to comply with ANZ policies (including the Code of Conduct), processes or directions;"}
{"context": "the employee is responsible or accountable, directly or indirectly, by virtue of their role or seniority for an occurrence/event which has had an adverse impact on ANZ;"}
{"context": "there has been misconduct and the employee was involved directly or indirectly, failed to take adequate steps, could be considered responsible due to their seniority, or the decision to award or grant the deferred remuneration was made on the basis of misinformation."}
{"context": "Further, where the CEO and/or Disclosed Executives of ANZ have failed to comply with their accountability obligations under the BEAR, their deferred remuneration will be reduced by an amount that is proportionate to the failure, as required by the BEAR."}
{"context": "An employee’s deferred remuneration is also subject to ANZ’s on-going and absolute discretion to further defer the vesting. Where ANZ exercises this discretion, the vesting date is postponed and will not vest unless and until ANZ determines it should vest."}
{"context": "Before any scheduled release of deferred remuneration, the Board (for the CEO and Disclosed Executives) and/or the CRG (for other employees) considers whether malus/downward adjustment or further deferral should be applied."}
{"context": "87"}
{"context": "7. ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONSEQUENCE FRAMEWORK"}
{"context": "This year we further strengthened the way we deal with material risk events through an enhanced Accountability and Consequence Framework."}
{"context": "The Consequence Review Group (CRG) is chaired by the CEO and members include the CRO, CFO, GE T&C and GGM IA. The CRG oversees the implementation and ongoing effectiveness of ANZ’s Accountability and Consequence Framework, being cognisant of its impact on the culture of ANZ. The CRG reviews material events, accountability and the application of suitable consequences (the HR Committee and Board determine accountability and consequences for the CEO and Disclosed Executives). Appropriate consequences are determined in light of the severity of the issue and may include, for example, one or more of the following: coaching, counselling, formal warnings, impacts to performance and remuneration outcomes, impacts on promotion, application of malus and ultimately termination of employment for the most serious issues. Our ongoing focus on accountability, consequences and driving a strong risk culture supports our customer commitment that when things go wrong, we fix them quickly and consistently hold executives, current (and former where we can), to account where appropriate."}
{"context": "In 2019 across the Group, 151 employees were terminated for breaches of our Code of Conduct. A further 516 employees received a formal disciplinary outcome, with managers required to apply impacts to their performance and remuneration outcomes as part of the annual review process."}
{"context": "ANZ announced in June 2019 that David Hisco would depart ANZ. The Board noted their concerns regarding the characterisation of certain transactions following an internal review of personal expenses. This was a clear and public example of the application of meaningful consequences. David’s employment was ceased, he was awarded no variable remuneration for 2019 and he immediately forfeited all unvested deferred remuneration which totalled around $7.4 million. This provided a clear message both internally and externally of the importance of doing the right thing and that this is expected of all our people regardless of seniority."}
{"context": "No malus was applied to the previously deferred remuneration of the CEO and Disclosed Executives during 2019. As disclosed in 2018 malus (downward adjustment) was applied to the unvested equity held by former Disclosed Executives."}
{"context": "We also seek to support a strong ‘speak up’ culture and ensure managers recognise exemplary risk and audit behaviours. The focus on speak up is being supported through our New Ways of Leading (NWOL) that are aligned with our purpose and values. NWOL focuses on five behaviours relevant for all employees and imperative for people leaders: be curious, create shared clarity, empower people, connect with empathy and grow people selflessly. We are incorporating culture into leader-led team activities to facilitate open, purposeful conversations about our culture and practices and create a psychologically safe environment for employees to speak up. We continue to raise employee awareness of, and promote the various ways that employees can speak up including through initiatives such as the Whistleblower Awareness Week."}
{"context": "At the senior leadership level, 30 current or former senior leaders (senior executives, executives and senior managers) had consequences applied in 2019 for Code of Conduct breaches or findings of accountability for a material event, or otherwise left the bank after an investigation had been initiated. The 30 employees represent ~1% of the senior leader population. The consequences applied included warnings, impacts to performance and/or remuneration outcomes and cessation of employment."}

{"context": "As disclosed in last year’s Remuneration Report, the NEDs who served on the Board in 2018 agreed to a 20% reduction of their Board fee for 2019 (20% reduction to the Chairman fee from $825,000 to $660,000, and 20% reduction to the NED member fee from $240,000 to $192,000) as a consequence for the shared accountability for the failures highlighted by the Royal Commission."}
{"context": "NEDs receive a base fee for being a Director of the Board, and additional fees for either chairing, or being a member of a Board Committee. The Chairman of the Board does not receive additional fees for serving on a Board Committee."}
{"context": "In setting Board and Committee fees, the Board considers: general industry practice, corporate governance principles, the responsibilities and risks attached to the NED role, the time commitment expected of NEDs on Group and Company matters, and fees paid to NEDs of comparable companies."}
{"context": "ANZ compares NED fees to a comparator group of Australian listed companies with a similar market capitalisation, with particular focus on the major financial services institutions.

Non monetary benefits generally consist of company-funded benefits (and the associated Fringe Benefits Tax) such as car parking, taxation services and costs met by the Company in relation to relocation and cessation. The total cash incentive relates to the cash component only. The relevant amortisation of the AVR/VR deferred components is included in share-based payments and has been amortised over the vesting period. The total AVR/VR was approved by the Board on 25 October 2019. 100% of the cash component of the AVR/VR awarded for the 2018 and 2019 years vested to the executive in the applicable financial year. Other cash and other equity allocations relate to employment arrangements such as compensation for bonus opportunity foregone and deferred remuneration forfeited, retention awards, and shares received in relation to the Employee Share Offer. For further details, see the individual footnotes for each relevant executive. For all Australian based executives, the 2018 and 2019 superannuation contributions reflect the Superannuation Guarantee Contribution based on the Maximum Contribution Base. From 31 August 2018, D Hisco commenced superannuation contributions to KiwiSaver where ANZ provides an employer contribution matching member contributions up to 4% of total gross pay (less employer superannuation contribution tax).

{"context": "Accrual relates to Retirement Allowance. As a result of being employed with ANZ before November 1992, M Hand is, and D Hisco was eligible to receive a Retirement Allowance on retirement, retrenchment, death, or resignation for illness, incapacity or domestic reasons. The Retirement Allowance is calculated as three months of preserved notional salary (which is 65% of fixed remuneration) plus an additional 3% of notional salary for each year of full-time service above 10 years less the total accrual value of long service leave (including taken and untaken). As required by AASB 2 Share-based payments, the amortisation value includes a proportion of the fair value (taking into account market-related vesting conditions) of all equity that had not yet fully vested as at the commencement of the financial year. The fair value is determined at grant date and is allocated on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period. The amount included as remuneration neither relates to, nor indicates, the benefit (if any) that the executive may ultimately realise if the equity becomes exercisable. Termination benefits reflect payment for accrued annual leave, long service leave and pay in lieu of notice in accordance with contract, payable on cessation. 2018 other equity allocations for M Carnegie relate to previously disclosed compensation for bonus opportunity foregone and deferred remuneration forfeited. K Corbally commenced in a Disclosed Executive role on 19 March 2018. So his 2018 remuneration reflects a partial service year. K Corbally's fixed remuneration was adjusted on 1 April 2019 based on a review of internal and external market relativities, and in recognition of the increase in regulatory activity and the broader risk environment. In relation to K Corbally's role before his appointment to the Group Executive Committee, in August 2016 the Board approved an equity retention award of $600,000 vesting in August 2019. Other equity allocations relate to this award."}

{"context": "A George's fixed remuneration was adjusted in May 2018 when she commenced in the expanded role of Deputy CEO and Group Executive, Wealth Australia. As disclosed in 2017, in relation to A George's role before her appointment to the Group Executive Committee, in July 2016 the Board approved a cash retention award of $500,000 with partial vesting in June 2017 ($250,000) and December 2017 ($250,000). M Hand commenced in a Disclosed Executive role on 29 December 2018. So his 2019 remuneration reflects a partial service year. M Hand's fixed remuneration was adjusted on 1 March 2019 on appointment to the Group Executive, Australia Retail and Commercial Banking role. Other cash and other equity allocations for M Jablko relate to previously disclosed compensation for bonus opportunity foregone and deferred remuneration forfeited. A Watson commenced in a Disclosed Executive role on 17 June 2019. So her 2019 remuneration reflects a partial service year. A Watson's fixed remuneration is paid in NZD and converted to AUD. In 2016 A Watson, D Hisco and F Ohlsson, and in 2018 and 2019 A Watson and D Hisco, were eligible to receive shares under the Employee Share Offer. That offer provides a grant of ANZ shares in each financial year to eligible employees subject to Board approval. See Note 31 Employee Share and Option Plans for further details on the Employee Share Offer."}
{"context": "D Hisco ceased employment 14 June 2019. Remuneration reflects up to his date of cessation (noting his annual fixed remuneration for 2019 remained unchanged at NZD 1.274 million). Share-based payments include the expensing treatment on cessation for unvested deferred remuneration (including reversals for forfeiture on cessation). D Hisco's fixed remuneration was paid in NZD and converted to AUD. Termination benefits reflect payment for accrued annual leave, long service leave and pay in lieu of notice in accordance with his contract, payable on cessation. Following an internal review it was determined that certain expense and allowances previously provided to D Hisco and categorised as business related would more appropriately be characterised as non-business related and included as non monetary benefits in the Remuneration Report. The 2018 comparative balances have been restated to increase non monetary benefits by $8,360 plus related Fringe Benefit Tax of $4,117. Similar items existed in the period between 2010-2017 which would have increased the non monetary benefits disclosed for D Hisco on average each year by approximately $44,580 plus related Fringe Benefit Tax of $21,956."}

The new price of $850 million includes approximately $25 million that ANZ has already received for the sale of ADGs in October 2018. The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements.

The Company is incorporated and domiciled in Australia. The address of the Company’s registered office and its principal place of business is ANZ Centre, 833 Collins Street, Docklands, Victoria, Australia 3008."}
{"context": "On 30 October 2019, the Directors resolved to authorise the issue of these financial statements."}
{"context": "Information in the financial statements is included only to the extent we consider it material and relevant to the understanding of the financial statements. A disclosure is considered material and relevant if, for example:"}

{"context": "the information relates to an aspect of the Group’s operations that is important to its future performance (qualitative factor); and"}
{"context": "the information is required under legislative requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, the Banking Act 1959 (Cth) or by the Group’s principal regulators, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)."}
{"context": "This section of the financial statements:"}
{"context": "outlines the basis upon which the Group’s financial statements have been prepared; and"}
{"context": "discusses any new accounting standards or regulations that directly impact the financial statements."}
{"context": "BASIS OF PREPARATION"}
{"context": "This financial report is a general purpose (Tier 1) financial report prepared by a ‘for profit’ entity, in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards (AASs) and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), the Corporations Act 2001, and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)."}
{"context": "We present the financial statements of the Group in Australian dollars, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. We have rounded values to the nearest million dollars ($m), unless otherwise stated, as allowed under the ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors Report) Instrument 2016/191. We measure the financial statements of each entity in the Group using the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates (the functional currency)."}
{"context": "BASIS OF MEASUREMENT"}
{"context": "We have prepared the financial information in accordance with the historical cost basis - except the following assets and liabilities which we have stated at their fair value:"}
{"context": "derivative financial instruments and in the case of fair value hedging, a fair value adjustment is made on the underlying hedged exposure;"}
{"context": "financial instruments held for trading;"}
{"context": "financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss;"}
{"context": "available-for-sale financial assets (prior to 1 October 2018);"}
{"context": "financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (applicable from 1 October 2018); and"}
{"context": "certain other assets and liabilities held for sale where the fair value less costs of disposal is less than their carrying value (excludes assets and liabilities held for sale which are exempt from this requirement)."}
{"context": "In accordance with AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts (AASB 1038) we have measured life insurance liabilities using the Margin on Services (MoS) model. In accordance with AASB 119 Employee Benefits (AASB 119) we have measured defined benefit obligations using the Projected Unit Credit Method."}
{"context": "DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS"}
{"context": "The aligned dealer groups business sold to IOOF Holdings Limited (IOOF) completed on 1 October 2018; the life insurance business sold to Zurich Financial Services Australia Limited completed on 31 May 2019; and the Wealth Australia pensions and investments business sold to IOOF and associated Group reclassification and consolidation impacts are treated as discontinued operations from a financial reporting perspective. These businesses qualify as discontinued operations, which are a subset of assets held for sale, as they represent a major line of business. The results of the divested businesses have been included in the ‘Profit/(Loss) from discontinued operations’ until their divestment date. The Balance Sheet is not restated when a business is reclassified as a discontinued operation."}

{"context": "ANZ 2018 ANNUAL REPORT"}
{"context": "NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)"}
{"context": "1. ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)"}
{"context": "BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION"}
{"context": "The consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries. An entity, including a structured entity, is considered a subsidiary of the Group when we determine that the Company has control over the entity. Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. We assess power by examining existing rights that give the Group the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity. We have eliminated, on consolidation, the effect of all transactions between entities in the Group."}
{"context": "FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION"}
{"context": "TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES Foreign currency transactions are translated into the relevant functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the relevant spot rate. Any foreign currency translation gains or losses that arise are included in profit or loss in the period they arise."}
{"context": "We measure translation differences on non-monetary items at fair value through profit or loss and report them as part of the fair value gain or loss on these items. We include any translation differences on non-monetary items classified as investment securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (applicable from 1 October 2018 ) and non-monetary items classified as available-for-sale financial assets in the available-for- sale revaluation reserve in equity (applicable prior to 1 October 2018)."}
{"context": "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS THAT HAVE A FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY THAT IS NOT AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS The financial statements of our foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars for consolidation into the Group Financial Statements using the following method:"}
{"context": "Foreign currency item"}
{"context": "Exchange rate used"}
{"context": "Assets and liabilities"}
{"context": "The reporting date rate"}
{"context": "Equity"}
{"context": "The initial investment date rate"}
{"context": "Income and expenses"}
{"context": "The average rate for the period – but if for a significant transaction we believe the average rate is not reasonable, then we use the transaction date rate"}
{"context": "Exchange differences arising from the translation of financial statements of foreign operations are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. When we dispose of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences are transferred to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on sale."}
{"context": "FIDUCIARY ACTIVITIES"}
{"context": "The Group provides fiduciary services to third parties including custody, nominee, trustee, administration and investment management services predominantly through the wealth businesses. This involves the Group holding assets on behalf of third parties and making decisions regarding the purchase and sale of financial instruments. If ANZ is not the beneficial owner or does not control the assets, then we do not recognise these transactions in these financial statements, except when required by accounting standards or another legislative requirement."}
{"context": "KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES"}
{"context": "In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made a number of judgements and applied estimates and assumptions about past and future events. Further information on the key judgements and estimates that we consider material to the financial statements are contained within the relevant notes to the financial statements."}

{"context": "108"}
{"context": "NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"}
{"context": "1. ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)"}
{"context": "ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED IN THE PERIOD"}
{"context": "AASB 9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (AASB 9)"}
{"context": "The Group has applied AASB 9 effective from 1 October 2018 (with the exception of the ‘own credit’ requirements relating to financial liabilities designated as measured at fair value, which were early adopted by the Group effective from 1 October 2013). In addition, the Group chose to early adopt AASB 2017-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (AASB 2017-6) effective from 1 October 2018. AASB 9 provides an accounting policy choice, which the Group has taken in current period, to continue to apply the AASB 139 hedge accounting requirements until the International Accounting Standards Board’s ongoing project on macro hedge accounting is completed."}
{"context": "AASB 9 and AASB 2017-6 stipulate new requirements for the impairment of financial assets, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and general hedge accounting. Details of the key requirements are outlined within the Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities sections on pages 125 and 144 respectively, and a reconciliation of the transitional impact of adopting the standard at 1 October 2018 is set out in Note 35."}
{"context": "AASB 15 REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (AASB 15)"}
{"context": "The Group adopted AASB 15 from 1 October 2018 which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements. The standard requires identification of distinct performance obligations within a contract, and allocation of the transaction price of the contract to those performance obligations. Revenue is then recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied. The standard also provides guidance on whether an entity is acting as a principal or an agent which impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis. In accordance with the transitional provisions of AASB 15, the Group has adopted the full retrospective transition approach. Under this approach, the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard has been recognised as an adjustment to opening retained earnings as at 1 October 2017 and comparative information for the 2018 reporting period has been restated."}
{"context": "The adoption of AASB 15 resulted in the following changes in accounting policy:"}
{"context": "Recognition of trail commission revenue: trail commission revenue previously recognised over time is now recognised at the time the Group initially distributes the underlying product to the customer where it is highly probable the revenue will not need to be reversed in future periods."}
{"context": "This policy change resulted in an increase to the opening balances of Other assets of $32 million, Deferred tax liabilities of $10 million and Retained earnings of $22 million as at 1 October 2017 to recognise revenue that qualifies for upfront recognition under AASB 15 but was not previously recognised under AASB 118 Revenue (AASB 118). The change did not impact net profit or earnings per share in the comparative periods."}
{"context": "Presentation: Certain credit card loyalty costs and other costs will be presented as operating expenses where the Group has assessed that it is acting as principal (rather than an agent). Previously these costs were presented as a reduction of other operating income. In addition, certain incentives received from card scheme providers related to card marketing activities will be presented as operating income where the Group has assessed that it is acting as principal (rather than an agent). Previously these incentives were presented as a reduction of operating expenses. The presentation of these costs under AASB 15 increased other operating income and operating expenses by $153 million in 2018. The changes did not impact net profit or earnings per share in the comparative periods."}
{"context": "A minor balance sheet reclassification associated with credit card loyalty programs is set out in Note 35."}
{"context": "ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT EARLY ADOPTED A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been published but are not mandatory for the financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2019, and have not been applied by the Group in preparing these financial statements. Further details of these are set out below."}
{"context": "GENERAL HEDGE ACCOUNTING"}
{"context": "AASB 9 introduces new hedge accounting requirements which more closely align accounting with risk management activities undertaken when hedging financial and non-financial risks. AASB 9 provides the Group with an accounting policy choice to continue to apply the AASB 139 hedge accounting requirements until the International Accounting Standards Board’s ongoing project on macro hedge accounting is completed. The Group currently applies the hedge accounting requirements of AASB 139."}
{"context": "AASB 16 LEASES (AASB 16)"}
{"context": "AASB 16 is effective for the Group from 1 October 2019 and replaces the previous standard AASB 117 Leases (AASB 117). AASB 16 primarily impacts the Group’s property and technology leases which were previously classified as operating leases. Under AASB 117, operating leases were not recognised on balance sheet and rent payments were expensed over the lease term."}
{"context": "Under AASB 16, lessees must recognise all leases (except for leases of low value assets and short term leases) on balance sheet under a single accounting model. Accordingly, the Group will recognise its right to use an underlying leased asset over the lease term as a right-of-use (ROU) asset, and its obligation to make lease payments as a lease liability. In the income statement, the Group will recognise depreciation expense on the ROU asset and interest expense on the lease liability. As a result, lease expenses will be higher in the early periods of a lease and lower in the later periods of the lease compared to the previous standard where expenses were constant over the lease term. Cumulative expenses over the life of a lease will not change."}

{"context": "ANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT"}
{"context": "NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)"}
{"context": "1. ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)"}
{"context": "The Group will apply the modified retrospective transition approach whereby initial lease liabilities are recognised based on the present value of remaining lease payments as of the transition date. The initial ROU asset recognised for certain large commercial and retail leases will be measured as if AASB 16 had always been applied to the leases. For all other leases, the initial ROU asset will be measured as equal to the initial lease liability. Based on this transition approach, the Group expects to recognise an increase in liabilities of $1.7 billion and an increase in assets of $1.6 billion. This is expected to result in a reduction to opening retained earnings of $82 million and an increase in deferred tax assets of $43 million as of 1 October 2019. Comparative information from prior periods will not be restated."}
{"context": "The implementation of AASB 16 requires management to make certain key judgements including the determination of lease terms, discount rates and identifying arrangements that contain a lease. These estimates may be refined as the Group finalises its implementation of the standard in the first half of the 2020 financial year."}
{"context": "AASB 17 INSURANCE CONTRACTS (AASB 17)"}
{"context": "The final version of AASB 17 was issued in July 2017 and is not effective for the Group until 1 October 2021. It will replace AASB 4 Insurance Contracts, AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts and AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts. AASB 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts."}
{"context": "The measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements under AASB 17 are significantly different from current accounting standards. Although the overall profit recognised in respect of insurance contracts will not change, it is expected that the timing of profit recognition will change."}
{"context": "The impact of AASB 17 is not expected to have material impact on the Group."}
{"context": "AASB INTERPRETATION 23 UNCERTAINTY OVER INCOME TAX TREATMENTS (INTERPRETATION 23)"}
{"context": "In July 2017 the AASB issued Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments. The Interpretation clarifies application of recognition and measurement requirements in AASB 112 Income Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments."}
{"context": "Interpretation 23 will apply to the Group from 1 October 2019, and is not expected to have a material impact on the Group."}
{"context": "REVISED CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK"}
{"context": "In June 2019 the AASB issued a revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting. The new Framework includes updated definitions and criteria for the recognition and derecognition of assets and liabilities. Additionally it introduces new concepts on measurement, including factors to consider when selecting a measurement basis. The revised Conceptual Framework will apply to the Group from 1 October 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Group."}
{"context": "INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK REFORM"}
{"context": "Interbank offered rates (IBORs), such as LIBOR, are a key reference rate for derivatives, loans and securities for global financial markets. In response to concerns about the transparency and liquidity of IBOR rates, regulators in a number of jurisdictions across the globe are well advanced in developing benchmark rates to phase out and replace IBORs, these projects are collectively known as ‘IBOR Reform’. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is also considering the financial reporting implications of IBOR reform which is expected to impact elements of financial instrument accounting, including hedge accounting, loan modifications, fair value methodologies and disclosures."}
{"context": "The IASB project is split into two phases: Phase 1 deals with pre-replacement issues (issues affecting financial reporting in the period before the replacement of IBOR’s); and Phase 2 deals with replacement issues (issues affecting financial reporting when existing IBOR’s are replaced)."}
{"context": "In September 2019, the IASB issued a final standard, Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 which focuses on ‘pre-rate replacement issues’ and provides exceptions to specific hedge accounting requirements under IAS 39 and IFRS 9 so that entities will be able to apply those hedge accounting requirements under an assumption that the interest rate benchmark is not altered as a result of the interest rate benchmark reform. In October 2019, AASB adopted these amendments in AASB 2019-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform."}
{"context": "Although the Group anticipates the new standard, once adopted, will provide certain relief in relation to hedge accounting requirements, for 30 September 2019 reporting purposes, it has considered the existing portfolio of hedge accounted relationships in light of:"}
{"context": "the significant uncertainty surrounding the method and timing of transition away from IBORs; and"}
{"context": "ongoing application and reliance in capital markets on IBOR’s for financial instrument pricing."}
{"context": "As result of the above factors, the Group has concluded that continuation of hedge accounting relationships for potentially impacted hedge relationship remains appropriate."}
{"context": "The Group is considering the new standard which is effective on 1 October 2020 but may be adopted earlier."}

{"context": "RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT"}
{"context": "NET INTEREST INCOME Interest Income and Expense We recognise interest income and expense for all financial instruments, including those classified as held for trading, assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (applicable from 1 October 2018), available-for-sale assets (applicable prior to 1 October 2018) or designated at fair value through profit or loss in net interest income. For assets held at amortised cost we use the effective interest rate method to calculate amortised cost. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the stream of estimated future cash receipts or payments over the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. For assets subject to prepayment, we determine their expected life on the basis of historical behaviour of the particular asset portfolio - taking into account contractual obligations and prepayment experience."}
{"context": "We recognise fees and costs, which form an integral part of the financial instrument (for example loan origination fees and costs), using the effective interest rate method. This is presented as part of interest income or expense depending on whether the underlying financial instrument is a financial asset or financial liability."}
{"context": "Major Bank Levy The Major Bank Levy Act 2017 (‘Levy’ or ‘Major bank levy’) applies a rate of 0.06% to certain liabilities of the Company. The Group has determined that the levy represents a finance cost for the Group and $363 million (2018: $355 million) is presented in interest expense in the Income Statement."}
{"context": "OTHER OPERATING INCOME Fee and Commission Revenue We recognise fee and commission revenue arising from contracts with customers (a) over time when the performance obligation is satisfied across more than one reporting period or (b) at a point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied immediately or is satisfied within one reporting period."}
{"context": "Lending fees exclude fees treated as part of the effective yield calculation of interest income. Lending fees include certain guarantee and commitment fees where the loan or guarantee is not likely to be drawn upon, and other fees charged for providing customers a distinct good or service that are recognised separately from the underlying lending product (including annual package fees that provide benefits on other ANZ products)."}
{"context": "Non lending fees includes fees associated with deposit and credit card accounts, interchange fees and fees charged for specific customer transactions such as international money transfers. Where the Group provides multiple goods or services to a customer under the same contract, the Group allocates the transaction price of the contract to distinct performance obligations based on the relative stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation. Revenue is recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied."}
{"context": "Commissions represent fees from third parties where ANZ acts as an agent by arranging a third party (e.g. an insurance provider) to provide goods and services to a customer. In such cases, ANZ is not primarily responsible for providing the underlying good or service to the customer. If the Group collects funds on behalf of a third party when acting as an agent, the Group only recognises the net commission it retains as revenue. When the commission is variable based on factors outside the control of the Group (e.g. a trail commission), revenue is only recognised if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of the variable amount will not be required in future periods."}
{"context": "Funds management income represent fees earned from customers for providing financial advice and fees for asset management services and advice provided to investment funds. Revenue is recognised either at the point the financial advice is provided or over the period in which the asset management services are delivered. Performance fees associated with funds management activities are only recognised when it becomes highly probable the performance hurdle will be achieved."}
{"context": "Net Foreign Exchange Earnings and Other Financial Instruments Income We recognise the following as net foreign exchange earnings and other financial instruments income:"}

{"context": "the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset (specifically whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest)."}
{"context": "The resultant financial asset classifications are as follows:"}
{"context": "Amortised cost: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest only and which are held in a business model whose objective is to collect their cash flows;"}
{"context": "FVOCI: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest only and which are held in a business model whose objective is to collect their cash flows or to sell the assets; and"}

{"context": "Movements in the price of the underlying variables, which cause the value of the contract to fluctuate, are reflected in the fair value of the derivative."}
{"context": "PURPOSE"}
{"context": "The Group’s derivative financial instruments have been categorised as following:"}
{"context": "Trading"}
{"context": "Derivatives held in order to:  Meet customer needs for managing their own risks.  Manage risks in the Group that are not in a designated hedge accounting relationship (balance sheet"}
{"context": "management)."}
{"context": "Undertake market making and positioning activities to generate profits from short-term fluctuations in prices or margins."}
{"context": "Designated in Hedging Relationships"}

{"context": "Hedges of the Group’s exposures to interest rate risk and currency risk.  Hedges of other exposures relating to non-trading positions."}
{"context": "TYPES"}
{"context": "The Group offers and uses four different types of derivative financial instruments:"}
{"context": "Forwards"}
{"context": "A contract documenting the rate of interest, or the currency exchange rate, to be paid or received on a notional principal amount at a future date."}
{"context": "Futures"}
{"context": "An exchange traded contract in which the parties agree to buy or sell an asset in the future for a price agreed on the transaction date, with a net settlement in cash paid on the future date without physical delivery of the asset."}
{"context": "Swaps"}
{"context": "A contract in which two parties exchange a series of cash flows for another."}
{"context": "Options"}
{"context": "A contract in which the buyer of the contract has the right - but not the obligation - to buy (known as a “call option”) or to sell (known as a “put option”) an asset or instrument at a set price on a future date. The seller has the corresponding obligation to fulfil the transaction to sell or buy the asset or instrument if the buyer exercises the option."}
{"context": "RISKS MANAGED"}
{"context": "The Group offers and uses the instruments described above to manage fluctuations in the following market factors:"}
{"context": "Foreign Exchange"}
{"context": "Currencies at current or determined rates of exchange."}
{"context": "Interest Rate"}
{"context": "Fixed or variable interest rates applying to money lent, deposited or borrowed."}

{"context": "Recognition"}
{"context": "Initially and at each reporting date, we recognise all derivatives at fair value. If the fair value of a derivative is positive, then we carry it as an asset, but if its value is negative, then we carry it as a liability."}
{"context": "Valuation adjustments are integral in determining the fair value of derivatives. This includes:"}
{"context": "a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) to reflect the counterparty risk and/or event of default; and"}
{"context": "a funding valuation adjustment (FVA) to account for funding costs and benefits in the derivatives portfolio."}
{"context": "Derecognition of assets and liabilities"}
{"context": "We remove derivative assets from our balance sheet when the contracts expire or we have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. We remove derivative liabilities from our balance sheet when the Group’s contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired."}
{"context": "Impact on the Income Statement"}
{"context": "How we recognise gains or losses on derivative financial instruments depends on whether the derivative is held for trading or is designated into a hedging relationship. For derivative financial instruments held for trading, gains or losses from changes in the fair value are recognised in profit or loss."}
{"context": "For an instrument designated into a hedging relationship, the recognition of gains or losses depends on the nature of the item being hedged. Refer to the previous table on page 129 for profit or loss treatment depending on the hedge type."}
{"context": "Sources of hedge ineffectiveness may arise from basis risk and differences in discounting between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The hedging instruments are discounted using Overnight Index Swaps discount curves which are not applied to the hedged items."}
{"context": "Hedge effectiveness"}
{"context": "To qualify for hedge accounting a hedge is expected to be highly effective. A hedge is highly effective only if the following conditions are met:"}
{"context": "the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the period for which the hedge is designated (prospective effectiveness); and"}
{"context": "the actual results of the hedge are within the range of 80-125% (retrospective effectiveness)."}
{"context": "The Group monitors hedge effectiveness on a regular basis but at a minimum at least at each reporting date."}
{"context": "KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES"}
{"context": "Judgement is required when we select the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of derivatives, particularly the selection of valuation inputs that are not readily observable, and the application of valuation adjustments to certain derivatives. Refer to Note 17 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities for further details."}

{"context": "The carrying value of equity securities at FVOCI / AFS equity securities is $1,221 million (2018: $1,095 million). This includes the Group’s $1,106 million (2018: $1,025 million) investment in the Bank of Tianjin (BoT)."}
{"context": "RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT"}
{"context": "Policy applicable from 1 October 2018"}
{"context": "Investment securities are those financial assets in security form (i.e. transferable debt or equity instruments) that are not held for trading purposes. By way of exception, bills of exchange (a form of security/transferable instrument) which are used to facilitate the Group’s customer lending activities are classified as Loans and advances (rather than Investment securities) to better reflect the substance of the arrangement."}
{"context": "Non-traded equity investments may be designated at FVOCI on an instrument by instrument basis. If this election is made, gains or losses are not reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss on disposal of the investment. However, gains or losses may be reclassified within equity."}
{"context": "Assets disclosed as Investment securities are subject to the general classification and measurement policy for Financial Assets outlined at the commencement of the Group’s financial asset disclosures on page 125. Additionally, expected credit losses associated with “Investment securities - debt securities at amortised cost” and “Investment securities - debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income” are recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting policy outlined in Note 13. For “Investment securities – debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income” the allowance for ECL is recognised in the FVOCI reserve in equity with a corresponding charge to profit or loss."}
{"context": "Policy applicable prior to 1 October 2018"}
{"context": "AFS assets comprise non-derivative financial assets which we designate as AFS since we do not hold them principally for trading purposes. They include both equity and debt securities. AFS assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and are revalued at least bi-annually. On revaluation, we include movements in fair value within the available-for-sale revaluation reserve in equity, except for certain items which are recognised directly in profit or loss, being interest on debt securities, dividends received, foreign exchange on debt securities and impairment charges."}
{"context": "When we sell the asset, any cumulative gain or loss from the available-for-sale revaluation reserve is recognised in profit or loss."}
{"context": "At each reporting date, we assess whether any AFS assets are impaired. We assess the impairment of any debt securities if an event has occurred which will have a negative impact on the asset’s estimated cash flows. For equity securities, we assess if there is a significant or prolonged decline in their fair value below cost."}
{"context": "If an AFS asset is impaired, then we remove the cumulative loss related to that asset from the available-for-sale revaluation reserve. We then recognise it in profit or loss for:"}
{"context": "debt instruments, as a credit impairment expense; and"}
{"context": "equity instruments, as a negative impact in other operating income."}
{"context": "We recognise any later reversals of impairment on debt securities in the profit or loss through the credit impairment charge line. However, we do not make any reversals of impairment for equity securities. To the extent previously impaired equity securities recover in value, gains are recognised directly in equity."}
{"context": "KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES"}
{"context": "Judgement is required when we select valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of assets not valued using quoted market prices, particularly the selection of valuation inputs that are not readily observable.

{"context": "Loans and advances are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and are facilities the Group provides directly to customers or through third party channels."}
{"context": "Loans and advances are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the loan or advance, which are primarily brokerage/mortgage origination fees which we amortise over the estimated life of the loan. Subsequently, we then measure loans and advances at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, net of any provision for credit impairment, or at fair value when they are specifically designated on initial recognition as fair value through profit or loss or when held for trading."}
{"context": "We classify contracts to lease assets and hire purchase agreements as finance leases if they transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the customer or an unrelated third party. We include these facilities in ‘Other’ in the table above."}
{"context": "The Group enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets that are recognised on its balance sheet. When the Group retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets remain on the Group’s balance sheet, however if substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred, the Group derecognises the asset."}
{"context": "If the risks and rewards are partially retained and control over the asset is lost, the Group derecognises the asset. If control over the asset is not lost, the Group continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement."}
{"context": "We separately recognise the rights and obligations retained, or created, in the transfer of assets and liabilities as appropriate."}

{"context": "RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT"}
{"context": "Policy applicable from 1 October 2018"}
{"context": "EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS IMPAIRMENT MODEL"}
{"context": "The measurement of expected credit losses reflects an unbiased, probability weighted prediction which evaluates a range of scenarios and takes into account the time value of money, past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions."}
{"context": "Expected credit losses are either measured over 12 months or the expected lifetime of the financial asset, depending on credit deterioration since origination, according to the following three-stage approach:"}
{"context": "Stage 1: At the origination of a financial asset, and where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, an allowance equivalent to 12 months ECL is recognised reflecting the expected credit losses resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months from the reporting date. For instruments with a remaining maturity of less than 12 months, expected credit losses are estimated based on default events that are possible over the remaining time to maturity."}
{"context": "Stage 2: Where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised reflecting expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. If credit risk were to improve in a subsequent period such that the increase in credit risk since origination is no longer considered significant, the exposure returns to a Stage 1 classification and a 12 month ECL applies."}
{"context": "Stage 3: Where there is objective evidence of impairment, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised."}
{"context": "Expected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for exposures in Stage 1 and Stage 2, and on either a collective or individual basis when transferred to Stage 3."}
{"context": "MEASUREMENT OF EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS"}
{"context": "ECL is calculated as the product of the following credit risk factors at a facility level, discounted to incorporate the time value of money:"}
{"context": "Probability of default (PD) - the estimate of the likelihood that a borrower will default over a given period;"}
{"context": "Exposure at default (EAD) - the expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and interest, expected additional drawdowns and accrued interest; and"}
{"context": "Loss given default (LGD) - the expected loss in the event of the borrower defaulting, expressed as a percentage of the facility's EAD, taking into account direct and indirect recovery costs."}
{"context": "These credit risk factors are adjusted for current and forward looking information through the use of macro-economic variables."}
{"context": "EXPECTED LIFE"}
{"context": "When estimating ECL for exposures in Stage 2 and 3, the Group considers the expected lifetime over which it is exposed to credit risk."}
{"context": "For non-retail portfolios, the Group uses the maximum contractual period as the expected lifetime for non-revolving credit facilities. For non-retail revolving credit facilities, such as corporate lines of credit, the expected life reflects the Group’s contractual right to withdraw a facility as part of a contractually agreed annual review, after taking into account the applicable notice period."}
{"context": "For retail portfolios, the expected lifetime is determined using behavioural term, taking into account expected prepayment behaviour and substantial modifications."}
{"context": "DEFINITION OF DEFAULT, CREDIT IMPAIRED AND WRITE-OFFS"}
{"context": "The definition of default used in measuring expected credit losses is aligned to the definition used for internal credit risk management purposes across all portfolios. This definition is also in line with the regulatory definition of default. Default occurs when there are indicators that a debtor is unlikely to fully satisfy contractual credit obligations to the Group, or the exposure is 90 days past due."}
{"context": "Financial assets, including those that are well secured, are considered credit impaired for financial reporting purposes when they default."}
{"context": "When there is no realistic probability of recovery, loans are written off against the related impairment allowance on completion of the Group’s internal processes and when all reasonably expected recoveries have been collected. In subsequent periods, any recoveries of amounts previously written-off are credited to credit impairment charge in the income statement."}

{"context": "13. ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)"}
{"context": "RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT"}
{"context": "MODIFIED FINANCIAL ASSETS"}
{"context": "If the terms of a financial asset are modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one for either credit or commercial reasons, an assessment is made to determine if the changes to the terms of the existing financial asset are considered substantial. This assessment considers both changes in cash flows arising from the modified terms as well as changes in the overall instrument risk profile; for example, changes in the principal (credit limit), term, or type of underlying collateral. Where a modification is considered non-substantial, the existing financial asset is not derecognised and its date of origination continues to be used to determine SICR. Where a modification is considered substantial, the existing financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at its fair value on the modification date, which also becomes the date of origination used to determine SICR for this new asset."}
{"context": "SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CREDIT RISK (SICR)"}
{"context": "Stage 2 assets are those that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination. In determining what constitutes a SICR, the Group considers both qualitative and quantitative information: i."}
{"context": "Internal credit rating grade"}
{"context": "For the majority of portfolios, the primary indicator of a SICR is a significant deterioration in the internal credit rating grade of a facility since origination and is measured by application of thresholds."}
{"context": "For non-retail portfolios, a SICR is determined by comparing the Customer Credit Rating (CCR) applicable to a facility at reporting date to the CCR at origination of that facility. A CCR is assigned to each borrower which reflects the probability of default of the borrower and incorporates both borrower and non-borrower specific information, including forward looking information. CCRs are subject to review at least annually or more frequently when an event occurs which could affect the credit risk of the customer."}
{"context": "For retail portfolios, a SICR is determined by comparing each facility’s scenario weighted lifetime probability of default at the reporting date to the scenario weighted lifetime probability of default at origination. The scenario weighted lifetime probability of default may increase significantly if:"}
{"context": "there has been a deterioration in the economic outlook, or an increase in economic uncertainty; or"}
{"context": "there has been a deterioration in the customer’s overall credit position, or ability to manage their credit obligations."}
{"context": "ii. Backstop criteria"}
{"context": "The Group uses 30 days past due arrears as a backstop criteria for both non-retail and retail portfolios. For retail portfolios only, facilities are required to demonstrate three to six months of good payment behaviour prior to being allocated back to Stage 1."}
{"context": "FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION"}
{"context": "Forward-looking information is incorporated into both our assessment of whether a financial asset has experienced a significant increase in credit risk since its initial recognition and in our estimate of ECL. In applying forward looking information for estimating ECL, the Group considers four probability-weighted forecast economic scenarios as follows:"}
{"context": "i."}
{"context": "Base case scenario"}
{"context": "The base case scenario is ANZ’s view of the most likely future macro-economic conditions. It reflects management’s assumptions used for strategic planning and budgeting, and also informs the Group Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) which is the process the Group applies in strategic and capital planning over a 3 year time horizon;"}
{"context": "ii. Upside and iii. Downside scenarios"}
{"context": "The upside and downside scenarios are fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions (that is, they are not based on the economic conditions prevailing at balance date) and are based on a combination of more optimistic (in the case of the upside) and pessimistic (in the case of the downside) economic events and uncertainty over long term horizons; and"}
{"context": "iv. Severe downside scenario"}
{"context": "The severe downside scenario is fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions and accounts for the potentially severe impact of less likely extremely adverse economic conditions. It reflects macro-economic conditions of a downturn economic event with a probability of occurrence once every 25 years."}
{"context": "The four scenarios are described in terms of macro-economic variables used in the PD, LGD and EAD models (collectively the ECL models) depending on the portfolio and country of the borrower. Examples of the variables include unemployment rates, GDP growth rates, house price indices, commercial property price indices and consumer price indices."}

{"context": "Probability weighting of each scenario is determined by management considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the base case scenario, as well as specific portfolio considerations where required. The Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO) is responsible for reviewing and approving the base case forecast scenario and the Credit and Market Risk Committee (CMRC) approves the probability weights applied to each scenario."}

{"context": "The Group recognises two types of impairment provisions for its loans and advances:"}
{"context": "Individual provisions for significant assets that are assessed to be impaired; and  Collective provisions for portfolios of similar assets that are assessed collectively for impairment."}
{"context": "The accounting treatment for each of them is detailed below:"}
{"context": "Individually"}
{"context": "Collectively"}
{"context": "Assessment"}
{"context": "If any impaired loans and advances exceed specified thresholds and an impairment event has been identified, then we assess the need for a provision individually."}
{"context": "To allow for any small value loans and advances where losses may have been incurred but not yet identified, and individually significant loans and advances that we do not assess as impaired, we assess them collectively in pools of assets with similar credit risk characteristics."}
{"context": "Impairment"}
{"context": "Loans and advances are assessed as impaired if we have objective evidence that we may not recover principal or interest payments (that is, a loss event has been incurred)."}
{"context": "We estimate the provision on the basis of historical loss experience for assets with similar credit risk characteristics to others in the respective collective pool. We adjust the historical loss experience based on current observable data – such as: changing economic conditions, the impact of the inherent risk of large concentrated losses within the portfolio and an assessment of the economic cycle."}
{"context": "Measurement"}
{"context": "We measure impairment loss as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and estimated future cash flows discounted to their present value at the asset’s original effective interest rate. We record the result as an expense in profit or loss in the period we identify the impairment and recognise a corresponding reduction in the carrying amount of loans and advances through an offsetting provision."}
{"context": "Uncollectable amounts"}
{"context": "If a loan or advance is uncollectable (whether partially or in full), then we write off the balance (and also any related provision for credit impairment). We write off unsecured retail facilities at the earlier of the facility becoming 180 days past due, or the customer’s bankruptcy or similar legal release from the obligation to repay the loan or advance. For secured facilities, write offs occur net of the proceeds determined to be recoverable from the realisation of collateral."}
{"context": "Recoveries"}
{"context": "If we recover any cash flows from loans and advances we have previously written off, then we recognise the recovery in profit or loss in the period the cash flows are received."}

{"context": "KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES"}
{"context": "Applicable from 1 October 2018"}
{"context": "When estimating the allowance for expected credit losses for loans and advances, we used management’s judgement in respect of the"}
{"context": "matters outlined below."}
{"context": "Key Judgements"}
{"context": "Determining when a significant increase in credit risk has occurred"}
{"context": "In the measurement of ECL, judgement is involved in setting the rules to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition of a loan, resulting in the financial asset moving from ‘stage 1’ to ‘stage 2’. This is a key area of judgement as transition from stage 1 to stage 2 increases the ECL calculation from an allowance based on the probability of default in the next 12 months, to an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses. Subsequent decreases in credit risk combined with transition from stage 2 to stage 1 may similarly result in significant changes in the ECL allowance."}
{"context": "Measuring both 12-month and lifetime credit losses"}
{"context": "The setting of precise trigger points requires judgement which may have a material impact upon the size of the ECL allowance. The Group monitors the effectiveness of SICR criteria on an ongoing basis. The PD, LGD, and EAD credit risk parameters used in determining ECL are point-in-time measures reflecting the relevant forward looking information determined by management. Judgement is involved in determining which forward-looking information variables are relevant for particular lending portfolios and for determining each portfolio’s point-in-time sensitivity."}
{"context": "In addition, judgement is required where behavioural characteristics are applied in estimating the lifetime of a facility to be used in measuring ECL. All other things being equal, an increase in the expected behavioural life will increase the amount of ECL."}
{"context": "Forecasting forward-looking scenarios"}
{"context": "Our forecast of forward looking information variables is established from a “base case” or most likely scenario that is used internally by management for planning and forecasting purposes."}
{"context": "The expected outcomes of key economic drivers for the base case scenario as at 30 September 2019 are as follows:"}
{"context": "Australia The unemployment rate is expected to remain essentially flat and GDP growth to improve modestly over the forecast period, with residential property values expected to improve after a period of decline. Commercial property prices are expected to decline slightly through the forecast period. Consumer price index growth is expected to rise from current levels. New Zealand GDP growth is forecast to improve modestly over the forecast period, with the unemployment rate remaining stable. Residential property values are expected to achieve modest levels of growth. Commercial property prices are expected to grow, however, the growth rate is expected to be modest through the forecast period. The consumer price index is expected to rise modestly. Rest of world GDP growth is forecast to taper lower in the near term due to uncertainty in the global outlook. Inflation is also expected to remain soft over the forecast period to 2020."}
{"context": "Probability weighting of each scenario"}
{"context": "Probability weighting of each scenario is determined by management considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the base case scenario, as well as specific portfolio considerations where required."}
{"context": "Management temporary adjustments"}
{"context": "Management temporary adjustments to the ECL allowance are adjustments we use in circumstances where we judge that our existing inputs, assumptions and model techniques do not capture all the risk factors relevant to our lending portfolios. Emerging local or global macroeconomic, microeconomic or political events, and natural disasters that are not incorporated into our current parameters, risk ratings, or forward-looking information are examples of such circumstances."}
{"context": "The use of management temporary adjustments may impact the amount of ECL recognised."}

{"context": "Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, or fair value through profit or loss when they are held for trading. Additionally, financial liabilities can be designated at FVTPL where:"}
{"context": "the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch which would otherwise arise;"}

{"context": "the financial liability contains one or more embedded derivatives unless:"}
{"context": "a) the embedded derivative does not significantly modify the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract, or"}
{"context": "b) the embedded derivative is closely related to the host financial liability."}
{"context": "Where financial liabilities are designated as measured at fair value, gains or losses relating to changes in the entity’s own credit risk are included in other comprehensive income, except where doing so would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. This section of AASB 9 was early adopted by the Group on 1 October 2013."}

For deposits and other borrowings designated at fair value we recognise the amount of fair value gain or loss attributable to changes in the Group’s own credit risk in other comprehensive income in retained earnings. Any remaining amount of fair value gain or loss we recognise directly in profit or loss. Once we have recognised an amount in other comprehensive income, we do not later reclassify it to profit or loss. Securities sold under repurchase agreements represent a liability to repurchase the financial assets that remain on our balance sheet since the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the Group. Over the life of the repurchase agreement, we recognise the difference between the sale price and the repurchase price and charge it to interest expense in the Income Statement."}

{"context": "OVERVIEW"}
{"context": "AN OVERVIEW OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK This overview is provided to aid the users of the financial statements to understand the context of the financial disclosures required under AASB 7. It should be read in conjunction with the Governance and Risk Management section."}
{"context": "The Board is responsible for establishing and overseeing the Group’s Risk Management Framework (RMF). The Board has delegated authority to the Board Risk Committee (BRC) to develop and monitor compliance with the Group’s risk management policies. The BRC reports regularly to the Board on its activities."}
{"context": "The Board approves the strategic objectives of the Group including:"}
{"context": "the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS), which sets out the Board’s expectations regarding the degree of risk that ANZ is prepared to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives and business plan; and"}
{"context": "the Risk Management Strategy (RMS), which describes ANZ’s strategy for managing risks and the key elements of the RMF that gives effect to this strategy. This includes a description of each material risk, and an overview of how the RMF addresses each risk, with reference to the relevant policies, standards and procedures. It also includes information on how ANZ identifies measures, evaluates, monitors, reports and controls or mitigates material risks."}
{"context": "The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and robust control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. At ANZ, risk is everyone’s responsibility."}
{"context": "The Group has an independent risk management function, headed by the Chief Risk Officer who:"}
{"context": "is responsible for overseeing the risk profile and the risk management framework;"}
{"context": "can effectively challenge activities and decisions that materially affect ANZ’s risk profile; and"}
{"context": "has an independent reporting line to the BRC to enable the appropriate escalation of issues of concern."}
{"context": "The Internal Audit Function reports directly to the Board Audit Committee (BAC). Internal Audit provides:"}
{"context": "an independent evaluation of the Group’s RMF annually that seeks to ensure compliance with, and the effectiveness of, the risk management framework;"}
{"context": "facilitation of a comprehensive review every three years that seeks to ensure that the appropriateness, effectiveness and adequacy of the risk management framework; and"}
{"context": "recommendations to improve the framework and/or work practices to strengthen the effectiveness of day to day operations."}
{"context": "152"}
{"context": "152"}
{"context": "NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"}
{"context": "16. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)"}
{"context": "CREDIT RISK"}
{"context": "CREDIT RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES Granting credit facilities to customers is one of the Group’s major sources of income. As this activity is also a principal risk, the Group dedicates considerable resources to its management. The Group assumes credit risk in a wide range of lending and other activities in diverse markets and in many jurisdictions. Credit risks arise from traditional lending to customers as well as from interbank, treasury, trade finance and capital markets activities around the world."}
{"context": "Our credit risk management framework ensures we apply a consistent approach across the Group when we measure, monitor and manage the credit risk appetite set by the Board. The Board is assisted and advised by the BRC in discharging its duty to oversee credit risk. The BRC:"}
{"context": "sets the credit risk appetite and credit strategies; and"}
{"context": "approves credit transactions beyond the discretion of executive management."}
{"context": "We quantify credit risk through an internal credit rating system (masterscales) to ensure consistency across exposure types and to provide a consistent framework for reporting and analysis. The system uses models and other tools to measure the following for customer exposures:"}
{"context": "Probability of Default (PD)"}
{"context": "Expressed by a Customer Credit Rating (CCR), reflecting the Group’s assessment of a customer’s ability to service and repay debt."}
{"context": "Exposure at Default (EAD)"}
{"context": "The expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and interest, expected additional draw downs and accrued interest at the time of default."}
{"context": "Loss Given Default (LGD)"}
{"context": "Expressed by a Security Indicator (SI) ranging from A to G. The SI is calculated by reference to the percentage of loan covered by security which the Group can realise if a customer defaults. The A-G scale is supplemented by a range of other SIs which cover factors such as cash cover and sovereign backing. For retail and some small business lending, we group exposures into large homogenous pools – and the LGD is assigned at the pool level."}
{"context": "Our specialist credit risk teams develop and validate the Group’s PD and LGD rating models. The outputs from these models drive our day-to-day credit risk management decisions including origination, pricing, approval levels, regulatory capital adequacy, economic capital allocation, and credit provisioning."}
{"context": "All customers with whom ANZ has a credit relationship are assigned a CCR at origination via either of the following assessment approaches:"}
{"context": "Large and more complex lending"}
{"context": "Retail and some small business lending"}
{"context": "Rating models provide a consistent and structured assessment, with judgement required around the use of out-of-model factors. We handle credit approval on a dual approval basis, jointly with the business writer and an independent credit officer."}
{"context": "Automated assessment of credit applications using a combination of scoring (application and behavioural), policy rules and external credit reporting information. If the application does not meet the automated assessment criteria, then it is referred out for manual assessment."}
{"context": "We use the Group’s internal CCRs to manage the credit quality of financial assets. To enable wider comparisons, the Group’s CCRs are mapped to external rating agency scales as follows:"}

{"context": "The Group has adopted AASB 9 effective from 1 October 2018 which has resulted in changes to the classification and measurement of financial assets, including the impairment of financial assets. The presentation of credit risk information for 2019 has been amended. Refer to Note 1 and 35 for further details on key requirements and impacts of the changes due to the adoption of AASB 9."}
{"context": "MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK For financial assets recognised on the balance sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount. In certain circumstances there may be differences between the carrying amounts reported on the balance sheet and the amounts reported in the tables below. Principally, these differences arise in respect of financial assets that are subject to risks other than credit risk, such as equity instruments which are primarily subject to market risk, or bank notes and coins."}
{"context": "For undrawn facilities, this maximum exposure to credit risk is the full amount of the committed facilities. For contingent exposures, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount the Group would have to pay if the instrument is called upon."}

{"context": "COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT"}
{"context": "We use collateral for on and off-balance sheet exposures to mitigate credit risk if a counterparty cannot meet its repayment obligations. Where there is sufficient collateral, an expected credit loss is not recognised. This is largely the case for certain lending products that are secured by corresponding investment for which the margin loans are utilised and for reverse repurchase agreements. For some products, the collateral provided by customers is fundamental to the product’s structuring, so it is not strictly the secondary source of repayment - for example, lending secured by trade receivables is typically repaid by the collection of those receivables. During the period there was no change in our collateral policies."}
{"context": "The nature of collateral or security held for the relevant classes of financial assets is as follows:"}
{"context": "Net loans and advances"}
{"context": "Loans - housing and personal"}
{"context": "Housing loans are secured by mortgage(s) over property and additional security may take the form of guarantees and deposits."}
{"context": "Personal lending (including credit cards and overdrafts) is predominantly unsecured. If we take security, then it is restricted to eligible vehicles, motor homes and other assets."}
{"context": "Loans - business"}
{"context": "Business loans may be secured, partially secured or unsecured. Typically, we take security by way of a mortgage over property and/or a charge over the business or other assets."}
{"context": "If appropriate, we may take other security to mitigate the credit risk, for example: guarantees, standby letters of credit or derivative protection."}
{"context": "Other financial assets"}
{"context": "Trading securities, Investment securities (from 1 October 2018), Available- for-sale assets (prior to 1 October 2018), Derivatives and Other financial assets"}
{"context": "For trading securities, we do not seek collateral directly from the issuer or counterparty. However, the collateral may be implicit in the terms of the instrument (for example, with an asset-backed security). The terms of debt securities may include collateralisation."}
{"context": "For derivatives, we typically terminate all contracts with the counterparty and settle on a net basis at market levels current at the time of a counterparty default under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreements."}
{"context": "Our preferred practice is to use a Credit Support Annex (CSA) to the ISDA so that open derivative positions with the counterparty are aggregated and cash collateral (or other forms of eligible collateral) is exchanged daily. The collateral is provided by the counterparty when their position is out of the money (or provided to the counterparty by ANZ when our position is out of the money)."}
{"context": "Off-balance sheet positions"}
{"context": "Undrawn and contingent facilities"}
{"context": "Collateral for off balance sheet positions is mainly held against undrawn facilities, and they are typically performance bonds or guarantees. Undrawn facilities that are secured include housing loans secured by mortgages over residential property and business lending secured by commercial real estate and/or charges over business assets."}

{"context": "16. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)"}
{"context": "MARKET RISK"}
{"context": "MARKET RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES Market risk stems from the Group’s trading and balance sheet management activities and the impact of changes and correlation between interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads and volatility in bond, commodity or equity prices."}
{"context": "The BRC delegates responsibility for day-to-day management of both market risks and compliance with market risk policies to the Credit & Market Risk Committee (CMRC) and the Group Asset & Liability Committee (GALCO)."}
{"context": "Within overall strategies and policies established by the BRC, business units and risk management have joint responsibility for the control of market risk at the Group level. The Market Risk team (a specialist risk management unit independent of the business) allocates market risk limits at various levels and monitors and reports on them daily. This detailed framework allocates individual limits to manage and control exposures using risk factors and profit and loss limits."}
{"context": "Management, measurement and reporting of market risk is undertaken in two broad categories:"}
{"context": "Traded Market Risk"}
{"context": "Non-Traded Market Risk"}
{"context": "Risk of loss from changes in the value of financial instruments due to movements in price factors for both physical and derivative trading positions. Principal risk categories monitored are:"}
{"context": "1. Currency risk – potential loss arising from changes in foreign exchange rates or their implied volatilities."}
{"context": "2. Interest rate risk – potential loss from changes in market interest rates or their implied volatilities."}
{"context": "Risk of loss associated with the management of non-traded interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange exposures. This includes interest rate risk in the banking book. This risk of loss arises from adverse changes in the overall and relative level of interest rates for different tenors, differences in the actual versus expected net interest margin, and the potential valuation risk associated with embedded options in financial instruments and bank products."}
{"context": "3. Credit spread risk – potential loss arising from a movement in margin or spread relative to a benchmark."}
{"context": "4. Commodity risk – potential loss arising from changes in commodity prices or their implied volatilities."}
{"context": "5. Equity risk – potential loss arising from changes in equity prices."}
{"context": "MEASUREMENT OF MARKET RISK We primarily manage and control market risk using Value at Risk (VaR), sensitivity analysis and stress testing."}
{"context": "VaR gauges the Group’s possible daily loss based on historical market movements."}
{"context": "The Group’s VaR approach for both traded and non-traded risk is historical simulation. We use historical changes in market rates, prices and volatilities over:"}
{"context": "the previous 500 business days, to calculate standard VaR, and  a 1-year stressed period, to calculate stressed VaR."}
{"context": "We calculate traded and non-traded VaR using one-day and ten-day holding periods. For stressed VaR, we use a ten-day period. Back testing is used to ensure our VaR models remain accurate."}
{"context": "ANZ measures VaR at a 99% confidence interval which means there is a 99% chance that a loss will not exceed the VaR for the relevant holding period."}

{"context": "Interest rate risk management Non-traded interest rate risk relates to the potential adverse impact of changes in market interest rates on the Group’s future net interest income. This risk arises from two principal sources, namely mismatches between the repricing dates of interest bearing assets and liabilities; and the investment of capital and other non-interest bearing liabilities in interest bearing assets. Interest rate risk is reported using VaR and scenario analysis (based on the impact of a 1% rate shock).

{"context": "KEY AREAS OF MEASUREMENT FOR LIQUIDITY RISK"}
{"context": "Scenario modelling of funding sources ANZ’s liquidity risk appetite is defined by a range of regulatory and internal liquidity metrics mandated by the Board. The metrics cover a range of scenarios of varying duration and level of severity."}

As part of meeting LCR requirements, the Group has a Committed Liquidity Facility (CLF) with the Reserve Bank of Australia. The CLF has been established to offset the shortage of available High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) in Australia and provides an alternative form of contingent liquidity. The total amount of the CLF available to a qualifying Australian Deposit-taking Institution is set annually by APRA. From 1 January 2019, ANZ’s CLF is $48.0 billion (2018 calendar year end: $46.9 billion)."}

{"context": "The Group carries a significant number of financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. In addition the Group also holds assets classified as held for sale which are measured at fair value less costs to sell. The fair value is the best estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date."}
{"context": "VALUATION The Group has an established control framework, including appropriate segregation of duties, to ensure that fair values are accurately determined, reported and controlled. The framework includes the following features:"}
{"context": "products are approved for transacting with external customers and counterparties only where fair values can be appropriately determined;"}
{"context": "quoted market prices used to value financial instruments are independently verified with information from external pricing providers;"}
{"context": "fair value methodologies and inputs are evaluated and approved by a function independent of the party that undertakes the transaction;"}

{"context": "valuation adjustments (such as funding valuation adjustments, credit valuation adjustments and bid-offer adjustments) are independently validated and monitored."}
{"context": "If the Group holds offsetting risk positions, then the Group uses the portfolio exception in AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement (AASB 13) to measure the fair value of such groups of financial assets and financial liabilities.

This mismatch arises as we measure the derivative financial instruments (which we acquired to mitigate interest rate risk of the assets or liabilities) at fair value through profit or loss."}
{"context": "Our approach ensures that we recognise the fair value movements on the assets or liabilities in profit or loss in the same period as the movement on the associated derivatives."}
{"context": "We may also designate certain loans and advances, certain deposits and other borrowings and debt issuances as fair value through profit or loss where they are managed on a fair value basis to align the measurement with how the instruments are managed."}

{"context": "The Group evaluates the material accuracy of the valuations incorporated in the financial statements as they can involve a high degree of judgement and estimation in determining the carrying values of financial assets and financial liabilities at the balance sheet date."}
{"context": "The majority of valuation models the Group uses employ only observable market data as inputs. However, for certain financial instruments, we may use data that is not readily observable in current markets. If we use unobservable market data, then we need to exercise more judgement to determine fair value depending on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation. Generally, we derive unobservable inputs from other relevant market data and compare them to observed transaction prices where available."}
{"context": "When establishing the fair value of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, the Group considers valuation adjustments in determining the fair value. We may apply adjustments (such as bid/offer spreads, credit valuation adjustments and funding valuation adjustments – refer Note 10 Derivative Financial Instruments) to the techniques used to reflect the Group’s assessment of factors that market participants would consider in setting fair value."}

These provisions involve judgements regarding the timing and outcome of future events, including estimates of expenditure required to satisfy such obligations. Where relevant, expert legal advice has been obtained and, in light of such advice, provisions and/or disclosures as deemed appropriate have been made."}
{"context": "In relation to customer remediation, determining the amount of the provisions, which represent management’s best estimate of the cost of settling the identified matters, requires the exercise of significant judgement. It will often be necessary to form a view on a number of different assumptions, including, the number of impacted customers, the average refund per customer, the associated remediation project costs, and the implications of regulatory exposures and customer claims having regard to their specific facts and circumstances. Consequently, the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions is reviewed on a regular basis against actual experience and other relevant evidence including expert legal advices and adjustments are made to the provisions where appropriate."}

{"context": "CAPITAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY"}
{"context": "ANZ’s capital management strategy aims to protect the interests of depositors, creditors and shareholders. We achieve this through an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) whereby ANZ conducts detailed strategic and capital planning over a 3 year time horizon. The process involves:"}
{"context": "forecasting economic variables, financial performance of ANZ’s divisions and the financial impact of new strategic initiatives to be implemented during the planning period;"}
{"context": "performing stress tests under different economic scenarios to determine the level of additional capital (‘stress capital buffer’) needed to absorb losses that may be experienced under an economic downturn;"}
{"context": "reviewing capital ratios and targets across various classes of capital against ANZ’s risk profile; and  developing a capital plan, taking into account capital ratio targets, current and future capital issuances requirements and options around capital products, timing and markets to execute the capital plan under differing market and economic conditions."}
{"context": "The capital plan is approved by the Board and updated as required. The Board and senior management are provided with regular updates of ANZ’s capital position. Any material actions required to ensure ongoing prudent capital management are submitted to the Board for approval. Throughout the year, the Group maintained compliance with all the regulatory requirements related to Capital Adequacy in the jurisdictions in which it operates."}
{"context": "REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT"}
{"context": "Australia As ANZ is an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) in Australia, it is primarily regulated by APRA under the Banking Act 1959 (Cth). ANZ must comply with the minimum regulatory capital requirements, prudential capital ratios and specific reporting levels that APRA sets and which are consistent with the global Basel III capital framework. This is the common framework for determining the appropriate level of bank regulatory capital as set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”). APRA requirements are summarised below:"}

{"context": "APRA also requires the ADI to hold additional CET1 buffers as follows:"}
{"context": "A capital conservation buffer (CCB) of 3.5% which is inclusive of the additional 1% surcharge for domestically systemically important banks (D-SIBs). APRA has determined that ANZ is a D-SIB."}
{"context": "A countercyclical capital buffer which is set on a jurisdictional basis. The requirement is currently set to zero for Australia."}
{"context": "ANZ reports to APRA on a Level 1 and Level 2 basis, and measures capital adequacy monthly on a Level 1 and Level 2 basis, and is not yet required to maintain capital on a Level 3 basis (APRA have yet to conclude required timing for Level 3 reporting)."}
{"context": "Life Insurance and Funds Management As required by APRA’s Prudential Standards, insurance and funds management activities are:"}
{"context": "de-consolidated for the purposes of calculating capital adequacy; and  excluded from the risk based capital adequacy framework."}
{"context": "We deduct the investment in these controlled entities 100% from CET1 capital, and if we include any profits from these activities in the Group’s results, then we exclude them from the determination of CET1 capital to the extent they have not been remitted to the Company."}

{"context": "27. STRUCTURED ENTITIES"}
{"context": "A Structured Entity (SE) is an entity that has been designed such that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in determining who controls the entity. SEs are generally established with restrictions on their ongoing activities in order to achieve narrow and well defined objectives."}
{"context": "SEs are classified as subsidiaries and consolidated when control exists. If the Group does not control a SE, then it is not consolidated. This note provides information on both consolidated and unconsolidated SEs."}
{"context": "The Group’s involvement with SEs is as follows:"}
{"context": "Type"}
{"context": "Details"}
{"context": "Securitisation"}
{"context": "The Group controls SEs established to securitise customer loans and advances that it has originated, in order to diversify sources of funding for liquidity management. Such transactions involve transfers to an internal securitisation (bankruptcy remote) vehicle used to create assets that are eligible for repurchase under agreements with the applicable central bank (these are known as ‘Repo eligible’). These internal securitisation SEs are consolidated. Refer to Note 28 Transfers of Financial Assets for further details."}
{"context": "The Group also establishes SEs on behalf of customers to securitise their loans or receivables. The Group may manage these securitisation vehicles or provide liquidity or other support. Additionally, the Group may acquire interests in securitisation vehicles set up by third parties through holding securities issued by such entities. In limited circumstances where control exists, the Group consolidates the SE."}
{"context": "Covered bond issuances"}
{"context": "Certain loans and advances have been assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs to provide security for issuances of debt securities by the Group. The Group retains control over these SEs and therefore they are consolidated. Refer to Note 28 Transfers of Financial Assets for further details."}
{"context": "Structured finance arrangements"}
{"context": "The Group is involved with SEs established:"}
{"context": "in connection with structured lending transactions to facilitate debt syndication and/or to ring-fence collateral; and"}
{"context": "to own assets that are leased to customers in structured leasing transactions."}
{"context": "The Group may manage the SE, hold minor amounts of the SE’s capital, or provide risk management products (derivatives) to the SE. In most instances, the Group does not control these SEs. In limited circumstances where control exists, the Group consolidates the SE."}
{"context": "Funds management activities"}
{"context": "The Group conducts investment management and other fiduciary activities as a responsible entity, trustee, custodian or manager for investment funds and trusts – including superannuation funds and wholesale and retail trusts (collectively ‘Investment Funds’). The Investment Funds are financed through the issuance of puttable units to investors and the Group considers them to be SEs. The Group’s exposure to Investment Funds is limited to receiving fees for services and derivatives entered into for risk management purposes. These interests do not create significant exposures to the funds that would allow the Group to control the funds. Therefore, the funds are not consolidated."}

{"context": "Securitisation and covered bond issuances"}
{"context": "The Group provides lending facilities, derivatives and commitments to these SEs and/or holds debt instruments that they have issued."}
{"context": "Structured finance arrangements"}
{"context": "The assets held by these SEs are normally pledged as collateral for financing provided. Certain consolidated SEs are financed entirely by the Group while others are financed by syndicated loan facilities in which the Group is a participant. The financing provided by the Group includes lending facilities where the Group’s exposure is limited to the amount of the loan and any undrawn amount. Additionally, the Group has provided Letters of Support to these consolidated SEs confirming that the Group will not demand repayment of the financing provided for the ensuing 12 month period."}
{"context": "The Group did not provide any non-contractual support to consolidated SEs during the year (2018: nil). Other than as disclosed above, the Group does not have any current intention to provide financial or other support to consolidated SEs."}
{"context": "UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES"}
{"context": "GROUP’S INTEREST IN UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES An ‘interest’ in an unconsolidated SE is any form of contractual or non-contractual involvement with a SE that exposes the Group to variability of returns from the performance of that SE. These interests include, but are not limited to: holdings of debt or equity securities; derivatives that pass-on risks specific to the performance of the SE; lending; loan commitments; financial guarantees; and fees from funds management activities."}
{"context": "For the purpose of disclosing interests in unconsolidated SEs:"}
{"context": "no disclosure is made if the Group’s involvement is not more than a passive interest - for example: when the Group’s involvement constitutes a typical customer-supplier relationship. On this basis, exposures to unconsolidated SEs that arise from lending, trading and investing activities are not considered disclosable interests - unless the design of the structured entity allows the Group to participate in decisions about the relevant activities (being those that significantly affect the entity’s returns)."}
{"context": "‘interests’ do not include derivatives intended to expose the Group to market-risk (rather than performance risk specific to the SE) or derivatives through which the Group creates, rather than absorbs, variability of the unconsolidated SE (such as purchase of credit protection under a credit default swap)."}

{"context": "The Group’s maximum exposure to loss represents the maximum amount of loss that the Group could incur as a result of its involvement with unconsolidated SEs if loss events were to take place — regardless of the probability of occurrence. This does not in any way represent the actual losses expected to be incurred. Furthermore, the maximum exposure to loss is stated gross of the effects of hedging and collateral arrangements entered into to mitigate ANZ’s exposure to loss."}

{"context": "the carrying amount plus the undrawn amount of any committed loans and advances."}
{"context": "Information about the size of the unconsolidated SEs that the Group is involved with is as follows:"}

{"context": "28. TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS"}
{"context": "In the normal course of business the Group enters into transactions where it transfers financial assets directly to third parties or to SEs. These transfers may give rise to the Group fully, or partially, derecognising those financial assets - depending on the Group’s exposure to the risks and rewards or control over the transferred assets. If the Group retains substantially all of the risk and rewards of a transferred asset, the transfer does not qualify for derecognition and the asset remains on the Group’s balance sheet in its entirety."}
{"context": "SECURITISATIONS Net loans and advances include residential mortgages securitised under the Group’s securitisation programs which are assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs to provide security for obligations payable on the notes issued by the SEs. The holders of the issued notes have full recourse to the pool of residential mortgages which have been securitised and the Group cannot otherwise pledge or dispose of the transferred assets."}
{"context": "In some instances the Group is also the holder of the securitised notes. In addition, the Group is entitled to any residual income of the SEs and sometimes enters into derivatives with the SEs. The Group retains the risks and rewards of the residential mortgages and continues to recognise the mortgages as financial assets. The obligation to pay this amount to the SE is recognised as a financial liability of the Group."}
{"context": "The Group is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with these securitisation SEs and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the SEs activities. The SEs are therefore consolidated by the Group."}
{"context": "COVERED BONDS The Group operates various global covered bond programs to raise funding in its primary markets. Net loans and advances include residential mortgages assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs associated with these covered bond programs. The mortgages provide security for the obligations payable on the issued covered bonds."}
{"context": "The covered bond holders have dual recourse to the issuer and the cover pool of assets. The issuer cannot otherwise pledge or dispose of the transferred assets, however, subject to legal arrangements it may repurchase and substitute assets as long as the required cover is maintained."}
{"context": "The Group is required to maintain the cover pool at a level sufficient to cover the bond obligations. In addition, the Group is entitled to any residual income of the covered bond SEs and enters into derivatives with the SEs. The Group retains the majority of the risks and rewards of the residential mortgages and continues to recognise the mortgages as financial assets. The obligation to pay this amount to the SEs is recognised as a financial liability of the Group."}
{"context": "The Group is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with the covered bond SEs and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the SEs activities. The SEs are therefore consolidated by the Group. The covered bonds issued externally are included within debt issuances."}
{"context": "REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS When the Group sells securities subject to repurchase agreements under which we retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, then those assets do not qualify for derecognition. An associated liability is recognised for the consideration received from the counterparty."}
{"context": "STRUCTURED FINANCE ARRANGEMENTS The Group arranges funding for certain customer transactions through structured leasing and commodity prepayment arrangements. These transactions are recognised on Group’s balance sheet as lease receivables or loans. At times, other financial institutions participate in the funding of these arrangements. This participation involves a proportionate transfer of the rights to the assets recognised by the Group. The participating banks have limited recourse to the leased assets or financed commodity and related proceeds. Where the Group continues to be exposed to some of the risks of the transferred assets through a derivative or other continuing involvement, the Group does not derecognise the lease receivable or loan. Instead, the Group recognises an associated liability representing its obligations to the participating financial institutions."}

On 17 October 2019, the Group announced it had agreed a revised sale price for its OnePath P&I business and ADGs to IOOF of $850 million, being a $125 million reduction from the original sale price of $975 million announced in October 2017. The new price of $850 million includes approximately $25 million that ANZ has already received for the sale of the ADGs in October 2018. The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements. Subject to APRA approval, the Group expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020.

The judgemental factors include determining: costs to sell, allocation of goodwill, indemnities provided under the sale contract and consideration received - particularly where elements of consideration are contingent in nature. Any impairment we record is based on the best available evidence of fair value compared to the carrying value before the impairment. The final sale price may be different to the fair value we estimate when recording the impairment. Management regularly assess the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions against actual outcomes and other relevant evidence and adjustments are made to fair value where appropriate.

{"context": "The main defined benefit superannuation schemes in which the Group participates operate under trust law and are managed and administered on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the relevant trust deed and rules and all relevant legislation. These schemes have corporate trustees, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group. The trustees are the legal owners of the assets, which are held separately from the assets of the Group, and are responsible for setting investment policy and agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the triennial actuarial valuation process."}
{"context": "The Group has defined benefit arrangements in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Philippines, Taiwan and United Kingdom. The defined benefit section of the ANZ Australian Staff Superannuation Scheme, the ANZ UK Staff Pension Scheme and the ANZ National Retirement Scheme in New Zealand are the three largest plans. They have been closed to new members since 1987, 2004 and 1991 respectively. None of the schemes had a material deficit, or surplus, at the last funding valuation. The Group has no present liability under any of the schemes’ trust deeds to fund a deficit (measured on a funding basis). A contingent liability of the Group may arise if any of the schemes were wound up."}

{"context": "an asset (capped to its recoverable amount) if the fair value of the assets is greater than the obligation."}
{"context": "In each reporting period, the movements in the net defined benefit liability are recognised as follows:"}

{"context": "Defined contribution superannuation schemes"}
{"context": "The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes. It also contributes (according to local law, in the various countries in which it operates) to Government and other plans that have the characteristics of defined contribution plans.

Where relevant, expert legal advice has been obtained and, in the light of such advice, provisions (refer to note 21) and/or disclosures as deemed appropriate have been made.

{"context": "REGULATORY AND CUSTOMER EXPOSURES In recent years there has been an increase in the number of matters on which the Group engages with its regulators. There have also been significant increases in the nature and scale of regulatory investigations and reviews, civil and criminal enforcement actions (whether by court action or otherwise), formal and informal inquiries, regulatory supervisory activities and the quantum of fines issued by regulators, particularly against financial institutions both in Australia and globally. The Group has received various notices and requests for information from its regulators as part of both industry-wide and Group-specific reviews and has also made disclosures to its regulators at its own instigation. The nature of these interactions can be wide ranging and, for example, currently include a range of matters including responsible lending practices, product suitability and distribution, interest and fees and the entitlement to charge them, customer remediation, wealth advice, insurance distribution, pricing, competition, conduct in financial markets and financial transactions, capital market transactions, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations, reporting and disclosure obligations and product disclosure documentation. There may be exposures to customers which are additional to any regulatory exposures. These could include class actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities. The outcomes and total costs associated with such reviews and possible exposures remain uncertain."}
{"context": "BANK FEES LITIGATION AND PERIODICAL PAYMENT REMEDIATION AND ASIC ACTION A litigation funder commenced a class action against the Company in 2010, followed by a second similar class action in March 2013. The applicants contended that certain exception fees (honour, dishonour and non-payment fees on transaction accounts and late payment and over-limit fees on credit cards) were unenforceable penalties and that various of the fees were also unenforceable under statutory provisions governing unconscionable conduct, unfair contract terms and unjust transactions. The claims in the March 2013 class action failed and have been dismissed."}
{"context": "The original claims in the 2010 class action have been dismissed. In 2017, a new claim was added to the 2010 class action, in relation to the Company’s entitlement to charge certain periodical payment non-payment fees. Part of the class of customers had already received remediation payments from the Company. An agreement to settle the claim was reached in December 2018. The settlement is subject to court approval."}
{"context": "In July 2019, ASIC commenced civil penalty proceedings against the Company in relation to the charging of fees for periodical payments in certain circumstances between August 2003 and February 2016. ASIC seeks civil penalties in respect of alleged false or misleading representations and unconscionable conduct. ASIC also alleges that the Company engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct and breached certain statutory obligations as a financial services licensee. The matter is at an early stage. The outcomes and total costs remain uncertain. The Company is defending the allegations."}
{"context": "BENCHMARK/RATE ACTIONS In July and August 2016, class action complaints were brought in the United States District Court against local and international banks, including the Company – one action relating to the bank bill swap rate (BBSW), and one action relating to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR) and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate (SOR). The class actions are expressed to apply to persons and entities that engaged in US-based transactions in financial instruments that were priced, benchmarked, and/or settled based on BBSW or SIBOR. The claimants seek damages or compensation in amounts not specified, and allege that the defendant banks, including the Company, violated US anti-trust laws and (in the BBSW case only) anti-racketeering laws, the Commodity Exchange Act, and unjust enrichment principles. The Company is defending the proceedings. The matters are at an early stage."}

{"context": "CAPITAL RAISING ACTIONS In June 2018, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions commenced criminal proceedings against the Company and a senior employee alleging that they were knowingly concerned in cartel conduct by the joint lead managers of the Company’s August 2015 underwritten institutional equity placement of approximately 80.8 million ordinary shares. The matter is at an early stage. The Company and its senior employee are defending the allegations."}
{"context": "In September 2018, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) commenced civil penalty proceedings against the Company alleging failure to comply with continuous disclosure obligations in connection with the Company’s August 2015 underwritten institutional equity placement. ASIC alleges the Company should have advised the market that the joint lead managers took up approximately 25.5 million ordinary shares of the placement. The matter is at an early stage. The Company is defending the allegations."}
{"context": "FRANCHISEE LITIGATION In February 2018, two related class actions were brought against the Company alleging breaches of contract and unconscionable conduct in relation to lending to 7-Eleven franchisees.

The Company provided warranties and certain indemnities relating to those businesses and, where it was anticipated that payments would be likely under the warranties or indemnities, made provisions to cover the anticipated liabilities. The issue below has not adversely impacted the reported results. All settlements and penalties to date have been covered within existing provisions."}
{"context": "In 1991 certain amounts were transferred from non-convertible Indian Rupee accounts maintained with Grindlays in India. These transactions may not have complied with the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973. Grindlays, on its own initiative, brought these transactions to the attention of the Reserve Bank of India. The Indian authorities served notices on Grindlays and certain of its officers in India and civil penalties have been imposed which are the subject of appeals. Criminal prosecutions are pending and will be defended. The amounts in issue are not material."}

{"context": "KEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued)"}
{"context": "ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES ($4,190M)"}
{"context": "Refer to the critical accounting estimates and judgements disclosures in relation to the allowance for expected credit losses in Note 13 to the Financial Report."}
{"context": "The Key Audit Matter AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9) was adopted by the Group on 1 October 2018. This is a key audit matter due to the significance of the loans and advances balance to the financial statements and the inherent complexity of the Group’s Expected Credit Loss (ECL) models (ECL models) used to measure ECL allowances. This new and complex accounting standard requires the Group to recognise ECLs on its loans and advances and off-balance sheet positions; the Group developed new models which are reliant on data as well as a number of estimates including the impact of multiple economic scenarios and other assumptions such as defining a significant increase in credit risk (SICR). This involves significant judgement and estimates and takes into account forward looking information reflecting potential future economic events."}
{"context": "AASB 9 requires the Group to measure ECLs on a forward-looking basis reflecting a range of future economic conditions, including key forward- looking assumptions such as forecast GDP and unemployment levels. Post-model adjustments to the ECL results are also made by the Group to address known ECL model limitations or emerging trends in the loan portfolios. We exercise significant judgement in challenging the economic scenarios used and the judgemental overlays the Group applied to the ECL results."}
{"context": "The criteria selected to identify a SICR, such as a decrease in customer credit rating (CCR), are key areas of judgement within the Group’s ECL methodology as these criteria determine if a forward-looking 12 month or lifetime allowance is recorded."}
{"context": "Separate from the ECL calculation, allowances for individually assessed loans exceeding specific thresholds are individually assessed by the Group. These specific allowances are established based on the expected future cash repayments and estimated proceeds from the value of the collateral held by the Group in respect of the loans."}
{"context": "How the matter was addressed in our audit Our audit procedures for the allowance for ECL and disclosures for the year ended 30 September 2019 included assessing the Group’s significant accounting policies against the requirements of the accounting standard. Additionally our procedures covered:"}
{"context": "We tested key controls in relation to:"}
{"context": "The Group’s ECL model governance and validation processes;"}
{"context": "The Group’s assessment and approval of the forward looking macroeconomic assumptions and scenario weightings through challenge applied by the Group’s internal governance processes; and"}
{"context": "Reconciliation of the data used in the ECL calculation process to gross balances recorded within the general ledger as well as source systems."}
{"context": "Testing the key controls over counterparty risk grading for wholesale loans (larger customer exposures are monitored individually). We tested the approval of new lending facilities against the Group’s lending policies, and controls over the monitoring of counterparty credit quality. This included testing controls over the identification of exposures showing signs of stress, either due to internal factors specific to the counterparty or external macroeconomic factors, and testing the timeliness of and the accuracy of counterparty risk assessments and risk grading against the requirements of the Group’s lending policies and regulatory requirements; and"}
{"context": "For retail loans, testing controls over the systems which record lending arrears, group exposures into delinquency buckets, and re-calculate individual allowances. We tested automated calculation and change management controls and evaluated the Group’s oversight of the portfolios, with a focus on controls over delinquency monitoring. We tested a sample of the level of allowances held against different loan products based on the delinquency profile and challenged assumptions made in respect of expected recoveries, including from collateral held."}
{"context": "We also tested relevant General Information Technology Controls (GITCs) over the key IT applications used by the Group in measuring ECL allowances as detailed in the IT Systems and Controls key audit matter below."}
{"context": "In addition to controls testing, our procedures included:"}
{"context": "Performing credit assessments of a sample of wholesale loans controlled by the Group’s specialist workout and recovery team assessed as higher risk or impaired, and a sample of other loans, focusing on larger exposures assessed by the Group as showing signs of deterioration, or in areas of emerging risk (assessed against external market conditions). We challenged the Group’s risk grading of the loan, assessment of loan recoverability, valuation of security and the impact on the credit allowance. To do this, we used the information on the Group’s loan file, understood the facts and circumstances of the case with the loan officer, and performed our own assessment of recoverability. Exercising our judgement, our procedures included using our understanding of relevant industries and the macroeconomic environment and comparing data and assumptions used by the Group in recoverability assessments to externally sourced evidence, such as commodity prices, publicly available audited financial statements and comparable external valuations of collateral held. Where relevant we assessed the forecast timing of future cash flows in the context of supporting valuations and approved business plans and challenged key assumptions implicit in the valuations;"}

{"context": "Working with KPMG Risk Consulting specialists, we assessed the accuracy of the Group’s ECL model predictions by re-performing, for a sample of loans, the ECL allowance and comparing this to the amount recorded by the Group;"}
{"context": "Working with KPMG Economic specialists, we challenged the Group’s forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions and scenarios incorporated in the Group’s ECL models. We compared the Group’s forecast GDP and unemployment rates to relevant publicly available macro-economic information, and considered other known variables and information obtained through our other audit procedures to identify contradictory indicators;"}
{"context": "Testing the implementation of the Group’s SICR methodology by re-performing the staging calculation for a sample of loans and comparing our expectation to actual staging applied on an individual account level, taking into consideration movements in CCR; and"}
{"context": "Assessing the accuracy of the data used in the ECL models by confirming a sample of data fields such as account balance and CCR to relevant source systems."}
{"context": "We also challenged key assumptions in the components of the Group’s post-model adjustments to the ECL allowance balance. This included:"}
{"context": "Evaluating underlying data used in concentration risk and economic cycle allowances by comparing underlying portfolio characteristics to recent loss experience, current market conditions and specific risks inherent in the Group’s loan portfolios;"}
{"context": "Assessing the requirement for other additional allowances considering the Group’s ECL model and data deficiencies identified by the Group’s ECL model validation processes, and"}

{"context": "VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD AT FAIR VALUE: - ASSETS HELD AT FAIR VALUE $243,888M - LIABILITIES HELD AT FAIR VALUE $130,346M"}
{"context": "Refer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures of fair values in Note 17 to the Financial Report."}
{"context": "The Key Audit Matter Financial instruments held at fair value on the Group’s balance sheet include investment securities, trading securities, derivative assets and liabilities, certain debt securities, and other assets and liabilities designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income. The instruments are mainly risk management products sold to customers and used by the Group to manage its own interest rate and foreign exchange risk."}
{"context": "The valuation of financial instruments held at fair value is considered a Key Audit Matter as:"}
{"context": "Financial instruments held at fair value are significant (25% of assets and 14% of liabilities);"}
{"context": "The significant volume and range of products transacted, in a number of international locations, increases the risk of inconsistencies in transaction management processes that could lead to inaccurate valuation;"}
{"context": "Determining the fair value of trading securities and derivatives involves a significant level of judgement by the Group, increasing the risk of error, and adding complexity to our audit. The level of judgement increases where internal models, as opposed to quoted market prices, are used to determine fair value of an instrument, or where inputs to the internal models, such as discount rates and measures of volatility, are not observable; or where there are a greater number of variables, including trade economic details and modelling assumptions, which feed into the internal models; and"}
{"context": "The valuation of certain derivatives held by the Group is sensitive to inputs including funding rates, probabilities of default loss given default. Both funding and credit risk are incorporated within the valuation of certain derivative instruments. This increased our audit effort in this area and necessitated the involvement of valuation specialists."}
{"context": "How the matter was addressed in our audit Our audit procedures for the valuation of financial instruments held at fair value included:"}
{"context": "Testing access rights and change management controls for key valuation systems;"}
{"context": "Testing interface controls, notably the completeness and accuracy of data transfers between transaction processing systems, key systems used to generate valuations and any related valuation adjustments, and the Group’s market risk management and finance systems to identify inconsistencies in transaction management and valuation processes across products and locations;"}

{"context": "Testing the Group’s data validation controls, such as those over key inputs in generating the fair value to market data where fair values were determined by front office teams."}
{"context": "We carried out testing over the valuation of financial instruments with both observable and unobservable inputs. Our specific testing involved valuation specialists and included:"}
{"context": "Re-performing the valuation of ‘level 1’ and ‘level 2’ investment securities and trading securities, which are primarily government, semi- government and corporate debt securities, by comparing the observable inputs, including quoted prices, to independently sourced market data;"}
{"context": "Using independent models, re-calculating the valuation of a sample, across locations, of derivative assets and liabilities where the fair value was determined using observable inputs. This included comparing a sample of observable inputs used in the Group’s derivative valuations to independently-sourced market data, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and volatilities;"}
{"context": "Where the fair value of derivatives and other financial assets and liabilities were determined using unobservable inputs (‘level 3’ instruments), challenging the Group’s valuation model by testing the key inputs used to comparable data in the market, including the use of proxy instruments and available alternatives. We compared the Group’s valuation methodology to industry practice and the criteria in the accounting standards; and"}
{"context": "Evaluating the appropriateness of the Group’s valuation methodology for derivative financial instruments, having regard to current and emerging derivative valuation practices across a range of peer institutions, and against the required criteria in the accounting standards. We tested adjustments made to valuations, particularly funding and credit valuation adjustments on un-collateralised derivatives. In particular, for a sample of individual counterparties, across locations, we tested key inputs to the credit valuation adjustment calculation, including the probability of default, against observable market data. Where proxies were used, we assessed the proxy against available alternatives, across a number of locations."}
{"context": "PROVISION FOR CUSTOMER REMEDIATION ($1,139M) Refer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures in Notes 21 and 33 to the Financial Report."}

{"context": "The Key Audit Matter As a major Australian bank, the group’s businesses utilise a large number of complex, interdependent Information Technology (IT) systems to process and record a high volume of transactions. Controls over access and changes to IT systems are critical to the recording of financial information and the preparation of a financial report which provides a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position and performance. The IT systems and controls, as they impact the financial recording and reporting of transactions, is a key audit matter and our audit approach could significantly differ depending on the effective operation of the Group’s IT controls. KPMG IT specialists were used throughout the engagement as a core part of our audit team."}
