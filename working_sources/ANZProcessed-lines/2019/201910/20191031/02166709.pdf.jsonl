{"context": "The Group announced a proposed 2019 Final Dividend of 80 cents per share, partially franked at 70%. New Zealand imputation credits of NZD 9 cents per share will also be attached."}
{"context": "Dividend Reinvestment Plan Neutralisation"}
{"context": "ANZ announced its intention to neutralise the impact of the shares allocated under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP). DRP participants do not need to take any action in respect of this in order to receive shares under the DRP."}
{"context": "The neutralisation of the DRP is expected to involve ANZ ordinary shares being purchased on-market during the DRP Pricing Period by a third party appointed by ANZ. To the extent that the on-market purchase is not able to be completed for any reason, then ANZ will issue new ordinary shares to meet its obligations under the DRP."}
{"context": "Franking Adjustments on ANZ Capital Notes"}
{"context": "Distributions paid on ANZ’s Capital Notes are required to be franked at the same level as the ordinary share dividend for the relevant half-year in which they are paid. As a result, distributions payable in the first half of the 2020 financial year will be franked at 70%."}
{"context": "However, holders of the Capital Notes will be paid an increased cash distribution amount to compensate them for the unfranked component of the distribution in accordance with their terms."}
{"context": "Further details of the adjustment to each distribution on the ANZ Capital Notes in that period will also be announced via ASX today."}
{"context": "Dividend, DRP & BOP Information"}
{"context": "For the 2019 Final Dividend, under the DRP and Bonus Option Plan (BOP) Terms and Conditions no discount will be applied when calculating the Acquisition Price used to determine the number of ANZ ordinary shares allocated."}
