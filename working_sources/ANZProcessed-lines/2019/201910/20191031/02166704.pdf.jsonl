{"context": "CEO COMMENTARY"}
{"context": "ANZ Chief Executive Officer Shayne Elliott said: “This has been a challenging year of slow economic growth, increased competition, regulatory change and global uncertainty."}
{"context": "“Despite the challenges, we maintained focus on improving customer experience, balance sheet strength and improving our culture and capability. In doing this, we significantly reduced the cost and risk of operating the bank even though strong headwinds impacted the sector. Investment was at record levels and we are a far stronger bank as a result of the progress made this year."}
{"context": "“Retail & Commercial in Australia had a difficult year. Along with increased remediation charges, intense competition and record low interest rates have had a significant impact on earnings. While yet to flow through to the balance sheet, management actions and operational improvements have seen a steady recovery in home loan applications in recent months. This momentum is expected to be maintained into 2020."}
{"context": "“The transformation of Institutional continued to provide prudent and diversified growth. While macro conditions had an impact on financial performance in the second half within Markets, the broader business is now generating returns above our cost of capital, providing important diversification given the lower growth in our home markets."}
{"context": "“New Zealand delivered a solid underlying result in an increasingly competitive environment. Compliance and remediation costs contributed to higher operating expenses. This was mainly driven by the complex work required to comply with new regulatory standards that all subsidiary banks be able to operate as stand-alone entities."}
{"context": "“In proposing the Final Dividend and franking level, the Board considered the bank’s strong capital position and its organic capital generation capacity. Our decision to reduce franking to a new base reflects the changed shape of our business as well as recognising how important the dividend, franking and predictability is to shareholders,” Mr Elliott said."}
{"context": "HIGHLIGHTS"}
{"context": "Business initiatives  Operational improvements and a targeted marketing campaign resulted in a greater than 30% increase in average applications for Australian home loans in the most recent half.  Capital benefits of $2.7 billion through completed sales of OnePath Life to Zurich Financial Services Australia, a 55% stake in our Cambodian joint-venture to J-Trust, the retail and small business franchise in Papua New Guinea to Kina Bank, and OnePath Life (NZ) to Cigna Corporation."}

{"context": "investment spend now expensed, with threshold for capitalisation of software development costs increasing to $20m in 1H16. Continues to be lowest of domestic peers."}
{"context": "DIVIDEND"}
{"context": "The Board recognises the importance of maintaining a stable dividend for many shareholders. This year it has assessed a proposed final dividend of 80 cents per share and franking of 70%, which is now appropriate given the changes to our business model, including the divestments of Wealth businesses in Australia, as well as the changing operating environment. This decision took into account ANZ’s strong capital position and its organic capital generation capacity."}
{"context": "2 ANZ’s progress against its sustainability targets are published on anz.com/cs 3 Executive Committee members excluded given subject to regulatory remuneration structures"}
{"context": "CREDIT QUALITY"}
{"context": "The total provision charge for the year was $795 million, up 16% from last year. The Group loss rate increased marginally to 13 bps (from 12 bps in 2018). Gross impaired assets reduced 5% year-on-year or $110 million to $2.0 billion. New impaired assets for the year were 2.0 billion, 5% lower than 2018. This was driven by a reduction in Institutional, which was partly offset by an increase in impairments for commercial businesses in Australia. While housing loans past due in Australia stabilised in the most recent quarter, we remain cautious given credit losses remain at historically low levels."}
{"context": "CAPITAL REVIEWS"}
{"context": "ANZ is engaging with both APRA and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) on their announced proposals that could lift the amount of capital required to support our New Zealand subsidiary. The impact of these changes depends on a number of factors and the final outcome remains uncertain. This includes the outcome of consultation, particularly the amount of capital required, the time allowed to achieve it, and the instruments permitted to be used. Given ANZ is in a strong capital position with organic generation capacity, management will maintain its focus on capital efficiency. The Board can consider further capital management actions once any regulatory changes are known in the coming months."}
{"context": "CUSTOMER REMEDIATION"}
{"context": "An additional charge of $559 million was announced in October as a result of an increase in provisions for remediation work, taking the total charge to $1.2 billion since 1H17. ANZ recognises the impact this has on both customers and shareholders. We are taking a proactive approach and are conducting detailed reviews across the Group. There are more than 1000 people4 working on remediation. We returned more than $100 million to impacted customers this financial year."}
{"context": "OUTLOOK"}
{"context": "Commenting on the outlook Mr Elliott said: “The Australian housing market is slowly recovering, however we expect challenging trading conditions to continue for the foreseeable future."}
{"context": "“We expect the operational improvements made to our Australian home loans business to help restore market share in our targeted segments. Record low interest rates and intense competition will continue to impact profitability."}
{"context": "“Geopolitical tensions will also place pressure on earnings given our exposure to global trade, although this can be managed through the diversification of our business. Increased compliance and remediation costs will also need to be closely managed over the foreseeable future."}
{"context": "“Capital efficiency will remain a focus, particularly as we manage the proposed changes impacting our business in New Zealand. While these changes are not final, we are starting from a strong capital position with solid organic generation capability."}
{"context": "“The environment has evolved as predicted. We have prepared well and our strong sense of purpose has us positioned to thrive in what will continue to be a tough period,” Mr Elliott said."}
