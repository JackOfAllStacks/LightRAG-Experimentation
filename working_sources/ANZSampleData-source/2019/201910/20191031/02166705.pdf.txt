STATUTORY TO CASH ADJUSTMENTS
Cash profit represents ANZ’s preferred measure of the result of the ongoing business activities of the Group, enabling readers to assess Group and Divisional performance against prior periods and against peer institutions.
To calculate cash profit, the Group excludes non-core items from statutory profit. Cash Profit continuing operations excludes the financial results of the Wealth Australia businesses being divested and associated Group reclassification and consolidation impacts treated as discontinued operations from a financial reporting perspective.

Lower lending volumes with slower system credit growth, competition and tighter home loan origination risk settings
NIM impacted by home loan mix changes and higher discounting, the impact of deposit rates and regulatory impact on credit card pricing. This was partially offset by home loans re-pricing
Other operating income impacted by removal of fees and lower volumes
Significant progress in 2H19 on lifting momentum in home loans with applications up half-on-half

 RBNZ capital proposal – Potential impact of NZ$6b to NZ$8b for ANZ NZ (from Sep-18).
Final impact depends on the outcome of the RBNZ consultation.

 APRA loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) – Total Capital requirements increased by 3% of
RWA (~$12b in Tier 2 based on Sep-19 position) by January 2024.
%
 Revisions to treatment of equity investments in subsidiaries - in the absence of any
offsetting management actions, this implies a reduction in ANZ’s Level 1 CET1 capital ratio of up to approximately $2.5b (75bps). However, ANZ believes that this outcome is unlikely and, post implementation of management actions, the net capital impact could be minimal.

INTERNATIONALLY COMPARABLE1 REGULATORY CAPITAL POSITION
APRA Level 2 CET1 – 30 September 2019
Corporate undrawn EAD and unsecured LGD adjustments
Australian ADI unsecured corporate lending LGDs and undrawn CCFs exceed those applied in many jurisdictions
Equity Investments & DTA
APRA requires 100% deduction from CET1 vs. Basel framework which allows concessional threshold prior to deduction
Mortgages
APRA requires use of 20% mortgage LGD floor vs. 10% under Basel framework. Additionally, APRA also requires a higher correlation factor vs 15% under Basel framework.
Specialised Lending
APRA requires supervisory slotting approach which results in more conservative risk weights than under Basel framework
IRRBB RWA
APRA includes in Pillar 1 RWA. This is not required under the Basel framework

Leverage ANZ compares equally well on leverage, however international comparisons are more difficult to make given the favourable treatment of derivatives under US GAAP
1. CET1 and leverage ratios are based on ANZ estimated adjustment for accrued expected future dividends where applicable. ANZ ratios are on an Internationally Comparable basis. All data sourced from company reports and ANZ estimates based on last reported half/full year results assuming Basel III capital reforms fully implemented 2. Includes adjustments for transitional AT1 where applicable. Exclude US banks as leverage ratio exposures are based on US GAAP accounting and therefore incomparable with other jurisdictions which are based on IFRS.

PROPERTY PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
Australian exposure increased by 2% HOH driven by higher lending to Funds and REITs in the Industrial sector partly offset by a decline in Residential lending given the slowdown in the residential property market. Retail exposure declined over the half and the Retail portfolio continues to be closely monitored owing to the weak operating environment
Slight decline in New Zealand exposure was driven by exchange rate movements and some significant repayments occurring during 2H FY19
APEA exposure remained stable for 2H19 with the portfolio concentrated on large well rated names in Singapore and Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Property market has seen a 1% index decline given current unrest. Market consensus estimates a decline as high of 10-20% if the protests continue through the year. The Hong Kong property portfolio remains subject to close monitoring of internal and external metrics

RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
OVERVIEW
Average qualifying pre-sales for Inner City Apartment
Development loans and corresponding LVRs were 101% and 52%, respectively as at Sep 19 (as compared to presales of 101% and LVR of 49% in Mar 19). These loans remain subject to tight parameters around LVR, presale debt cover and quantum of foreign purchaser presales. Overall appetite for Apartment Development has remained unchanged over the last half. The quality and experience of developers and builders remains a key selection criterion.
Outside of Inner City locations, development exposures are predominantly in the suburbs of the capital cities of the above listed states.
Residential Development projects continue to be closely monitored with level of oversight driven by progress of the project vs. plan, industry trends and emerging risks.

RESOURCES PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
Portfolio is skewed towards well capitalised and lower cost resource producers. • 32% of the book is less than one year duration. • • Investment grade exposures represent 79% of the portfolio vs. 68% at Sep 18. Increase in total coal mining exposure in FY19 primarily reflects mergers and acquisitions activity related to existing mines in 1H19, ie predominantly metallurgical coal assets sold by diversified miners to existing customers along with foreign currency exchange movements. Financing is mainly used to support continuing operations, and not mine expansions.
Thermal coal exposure is currently $838m. We expect our thermal coal exposure to decline over time, as it has since 2015 (reducing by 50% between FY15-FY19). Decreased exposure in 2H19 compared to 1H19 reflects ongoing portfolio management and application of ANZ policies. Our exposures to thermal coal are primarily concentrated in a small number of Australian-based miners.
Exposure to metallurgical coal mining (used for steel making) is currently $686m.

In July 2019 the APRA Monthly Authorised Deposit Institution Statistics (MADIS) publication replaced the APRA Monthly Banking Statistics (MBS) publication. Under the new publication, changes in the market cohort and changes in definitions impacted housing market share for ADIs when compared with the previous MBS publication. With respect to the housing categories, three noteworthy changes included: 
Inclusion of building societies, credit unions and other ADIs, resulting in an increase in FUM within the total system, consequently reducing market share of ADIs relative to market share under the MBS publication Change in the definition of what is included within the housing categories (for ANZ total housing reduced by $8.2b (June 2019) within the MADIS publication compared with the MBS publication) Changes to definition of Owner-Occupied and Investment housing based on housing purpose1


1.
APRA MADIS definition: Loans to households: Housing: Owner-occupied are loans to resident households for the purpose of housing, where the funds are used for a residential property that is occupied or to be occupied by the borrower(s) as their principal place of residence. The principal place of residence means the residential property at which an individual resides for the majority of the year. Loans to households: Housing: Investment are loans to resident households for the purpose of housing, where the funds are used for a residential property that is not owner-occupied.

AUSTRALIAN HOME LOANS
STRESS TESTING THE AUSTRALIAN MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO
ANZ conducts regular stress tests of its loan portfolios to meet risk management
objectives and satisfy regulatory requirements.
Stress tests are highly assumption-driven; results will depend on economic assumptions,
on modelling assumptions, and on assumptions about actions taken in response to the
economic scenario.
This illustrative recession scenario assumes significant reductions in consumer spending
and business investment, which lead to eight consecutive quarters of negative GDP
growth. This results in a significant increase in unemployment and material nationwide
falls in property prices.
Estimated portfolio losses under these stressed conditions are manageable and within the
Group’s capital base, with cumulative total losses at $2.7b over three years (net of LMI
recoveries).
The results have marginally improved from the stress test six months ago. Key reason for
the stressed losses reduction is the improved property price outlook and the impact of the
three rate cuts since May 2019, which are reflected in the underlying scenario.
1. Based on mortgage exposure at default and conditions as at 31 March 2019

ROYAL COMMISSION
OUR APPROACH, OUR RESPONSE
WE ARE RESPONDING TO THE ‘SPIRIT AND THE LETTER’ OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION.
Initial response
Committed in February 2019 to sixteen actions that we can take now including:

removing overdrawn and dishonour fees on our Pensioner Advantage account

improving our service to Indigenous customers in remote communities by setting up a dedicated phone service and giving them easier options to prove their identity
publishing principles to help family farming customers in financial distress
publishing principles on acting as a model litigant in disputes with our customers

implementing pay reforms that replace individual-based bonuses for most of our employees with an incentive based on the overall performance of the Group
Reviewed individual cases highlighted at the Commission and taken action where appropriate to resolve the matters
Reported to Government that we have made significant progress on the RC recommendations directed at banks, concerning distressed agricultural loans, remuneration of front line staff, the Sedgwick Review and changing culture and governance
Lessons from our experience

Identified eight lessons from our misconduct and failures to meet community standards and expectations to inform our response to the ‘spirit and letter’ of the Royal Commission
Now identifying measures that will allow us to be confident that these lessons have been acted on
Governance – aligned to the APRA self-assessment
Established a Royal Commission and Self-Assessment Oversight Group to oversee an integrated response to the Royal Commission and Self- Assessment. The Oversight Group is chaired by the Deputy Chief Executive Officer and includes the Group Chief Risk Officer
Constructive engagement with reform
Engaging constructively with Government and its agencies as they implement the recommendations directed at them
• Government has indicated that majority of its reforms will be consulted on and introduced into Parliament by the end of 2020
108
STRENGTHENING OUR RISK CULTURE
We have strengthened the way we deal with risk events through an enhanced Accountability and Consequence Framework, which is applicable to all of our people.

In 2019 across the Group, 151 employees were dismissed for breaches of our Code of Conduct. A further 516 employees received a formal disciplinary outcome, with managers required to apply impacts to their performance and remuneration outcomes as part of the annual review process.
At the senior leadership level, 30 current or former senior leaders (senior executives, executives and senior managers) received a consequence in 2019 for Code of Conduct breaches or findings of accountability for a material event, or otherwise left the bank after an investigation had been initiated.
The 30 employees represent ~ 1% of the senior leader population. The consequences applied included warnings, impacts to performance and/or remuneration outcomes and cessation of employment.

CUSTOMER EXAMPLE: BHP’S TRANSITION PLANNING
ANZ customer management informed by climate-related engagement
BHP has an integrated strategy including:
Targets to hold net operational emissions at or below FY2017 levels by FY2022 while continuing to grow their business.
We have identified carbon-intensive sectors most likely to be impacted by climate change
Active stewardship role working with customers, suppliers and other value chain participants to influence reductions in scope 3 including:
There are 100 of our largest emitting business customers in those sectors
A commitment to spend US$400m to develop technology to reduce emissions.
We are supporting these customers to establish, or strengthen their low carbon transition plans
We will use the results of this engagement to inform our risk assessment of customers in these sectors
HOW WE SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMERS – INCLUDING INCORPORATION OF CLIMATE-RISK MANAGEMENT
Training our staff to engage with customers on climate-risk
This year we provided training to over 1,000 bankers in our Institutional and Corporate businesses. The training covered:
how climate-related risks and opportunities might manifest for our customers
what elements we would expect to see in a robust transition plan
market and regulatory drivers that are focusing stakeholder attention on our customers
whether they have plans in place to manage their climate- related risks and opportunities
1. 2019 focus on ANZ staff managing specific higher carbon emitting customers
