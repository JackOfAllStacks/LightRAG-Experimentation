The Board delegates to the CEO, and through the CEO to senior management, via the ANZ Delegations of Authority Policy, the authority and responsibility to make decisions with the aim of achieving the approved strategies and financial objectives of ANZ. This Policy is reviewed regularly. ExCo generally meets each month and is responsible for delivering ANZ’s purpose, to shape a world where people and communities thrive. It does this by focusing on: ANZ also has a number of formally established management committees, each of which deals with particular sets of ongoing issues with defined decision-making authority. As part of implementing the Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR), individual accountability statements were developed and are maintained for ANZ’s Accountable Persons (all ANZ Directors and ExCo (other than the Group Executive, International) and the Group General Manager, Internal Audit). These contain a comprehensive statement of their individual responsibilities and acknowledgment of their accountability obligations under BEAR. All key stakeholders; Shaping ANZ’s culture and capabilities; and Prioritising ANZ’s efforts and allocation of resources.

The ANZ Board Reserved Powers and ANZ Delegations of Authority policy together comprise a comprehensive Delegations of Authority Framework that applies to all employees and contractors of ANZ and its controlled entities. 7 3.5 Board composition, selection and appointment ANZ reviews its Board composition regularly. The NBO Committee was created in 2019, with one of its duties being to assist the Board with all matters to do with reviewing Board composition. In assessing potential candidates and in undertaking reviews of the size and composition of the Board, the NBO Committee takes into account the guiding principle that the Board’s composition should reflect an appropriate mix having regard to such matters as: When considering potential candidates, the Board also notes that diversity has a much broader dimension and includes other matters such as age and cultural identity (for example, ethnicity and country of origin). The Committee also considers a candidate’s personal qualities, communication capabilities as well as ability to effectively challenge management, professional reputation and commitment to ethical behavior. skills/experience across the key areas identified in the ANZ Board Skills Matrix; The Committee also reviews and recommends the succession planning for, and the process for electing, the Chairman of the Board, as required. tenure; and diversity.

Board membership requirements as articulated in the Board Charter; and other considerations including ANZ’s strategic goals. The Board has an objective of maintaining at least 30% female membership of the Board, with a longer-term aspiration of having equal representation of females and males in its own composition.

Those criteria are set out in the Board Charter and are reviewed by the NBO Committee regularly against the ASX Governance Principles, the APRA Prudential Standards, and the other relevant requirements. Over and above the issue of independence, each Director has a continuing responsibility to determine whether he or she has a potential, or actual, conflict of interest in relation to any material matter which relates to the affairs of ANZ. Such a situation may arise from external associations, interests or personal relationships. The Audit Committee Charter sets additional independence criteria for Audit Committee members which is also considered. ANZ has a Directors’ Disclosure of Interest Protocol and Procedures for Handling Conflicts of Interest. It provides that a Director may not exercise any influence over the Board if an actual or potential conflict of interest exists. Further details of the criteria are set out on ANZ’s website at anz.com/corporategovernance The Protocol contains more information around ANZ’s approach to handling conflicts of interest, which is available on ANZ’s website at anz.com/corporategovernance. ANZ’s test for independence is whether a Director has a material relationship with ANZ. In summary, a relationship with ANZ is regarded as material if a reasonable person in the position of a Non-Executive Director of ANZ would expect there to be a real and sensible possibility that it would influence a Director’s mind in: 3.9 Outside commitments of Non-Executive Directors All Non-Executive Directors are required to notify the Chairman before accepting any new outside appointment. The Chairman reviews the proposed new appointment and considers the issue on an individual basis. making decisions on matters likely to come regularly before the Board or its Committees; objectively assessing information and advice given by management; setting policy for general application across ANZ; and The process the Chairman follows in carrying out this review, and the factors considered, are set out in the Outside Commitments of Non-Executive Directors document, which is available on ANZ’s website at anz.com/corporategovernance. generally carrying out the performance of his or her role as a Director. Directors are on the boards of companies and other organisations that have a commercial relationship with ANZ. Arrangements are in place (see Section 3.8) to seek to ensure that there are no independence issues arising from those relationships. If the Chairman proposes to accept a new outside appointment, the longest serving Non-Executive Director substitutes for the Chairman for the purpose of the review and approval process set out above. ANZ is comfortable with each of the outside commitments of the Non-Executive Directors. Directors’ biographies as set out in the Directors’ Report (in the 2019 Annual Report) and located on ANZ’s website at anz.com/directors highlight their major associations outside ANZ. The Board has reviewed each Non-Executive Director’s independence and concluded that each Non-Executive Director is independent. 10 4. Performance evaluations ANZ conducts performance evaluations of each Non-Executive Director, the Chairman of the Board, the Board and the Board Committees. Details of the evaluation processes are summarised below and set out in more detail in ANZ’s Board Renewal and Performance Evaluation Protocol, which is available on ANZ’s website at anz.com/corporategovernance. 4.1 Non-Executive Directors For the evaluation of Non-Executive Directors, the Chairman has a one-on-one meeting with the Non-Executive Director regarding their performance, including compliance with the Non-Executive Directors’ Code of Conduct. 4.2 Chairman of the Board ANZ’s longest serving Non-Executive Director facilitates the evaluation of the performance of the Chairman. This involves seeking input from each Director. 4.3 The Board On a periodic basis, the performance of the Board is evaluated using an independent external facilitator. ANZ expects this evaluation to occur approximately every three years. 4.4 Board Committees Each of the principal Board Committees conducts an annual self- assessment to evaluate the Committee’s performance using Guidelines approved by the NBO Committee. 4.5 Senior executives The Remuneration Report in the 2019 Annual Report sets out how the Board evaluates the performance of the CEO and other key senior executives, including how we assess Risk and Reputation, Financial and Discipline, Customer, and People and Culture measures. Relevant senior executive evaluations have been undertaken in respect of the 2019 financial year in accordance with this process. 4.6 2019 evaluation processes undertaken As at the time of this report, the 2019 financial year evaluations of the Chairman, Non-Executive Directors, the Board and Board Committees were being finalised and will be completed prior to the 2019 AGM. 5. Other information 5.1 Fit and proper person checks and BEAR suitability ANZ has processes that ensure individuals appointed to relevant senior positions have the appropriate fitness and propriety to properly discharge their prudential responsibilities. The framework is set out in ANZ’s Fit and Proper Policy for APRA Regulated Institutions. Before a new appointment is made to any of the following positions, the policy requires assessments to be carried out: each Director, relevant senior executives, and the APRA engagement partner of ANZ’s External Auditor. The Board carries out assessments of ANZ’s Non-Executive Directors, the Human Resources Committee assesses the CEO and key senior executives and the Audit Committee assesses the APRA engagement partner of ANZ’s External Auditor. The assessment includes: each individual providing attestations; the reviewer obtaining evidence of the individual’s material qualifications; and the reviewer checking the individual’s past — for example: for any criminal record, bankruptcy history and regulatory disqualifications. During the 2019 financial year, Annual Fit and Proper assessments were carried out for each Non-Executive Director, the CEO, key senior executives and the APRA engagement partner of ANZ’s External Auditor. The policy also sets out how the Board and Human Resources Committee assesses whether ANZ’s Accountable Persons are suitable to act in that capacity pursuant to the requirements of the BEAR. A Fit and Proper Policy summary with more information around the framework is available on ANZ’s website at anz.com/corporategovernance. 5.2 Appointment documentation Each new Non-Executive Director receives an appointment letter with a: Directors’ Handbook — the handbook includes information on a broad range of matters relating to the role of a Director, including information about all applicable policies; and Director’s Deed — each Director signs a Deed, currently in the form approved by shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting. The Deed covers a number of issues including indemnity, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, the right to obtain independent advice, confidentiality requirements and access to information. Each current Non-Executive Director received a letter at the commencement of their term which sets out the terms of their appointment. Formal letters are provided to senior executives setting out the terms of their appointment. 5.3 Induction for directors ANZ arranges an induction program which involves every new Director receiving information about: ANZ’s values and culture; the governance framework; the Non-Executive Directors’ Code of Conduct; Director related policies; Board and Committee policies, processes and key issues; financial management; and business operations. Directors are also briefed by senior management about matters concerning their areas of responsibility. 11 5.4 Directors right to independent advice To help Directors fulfill their responsibilities, each Director has the right (with the prior approval of the Chairman) to seek independent professional advice, at ANZ’s expense, about his or her responsibilities. In addition, the Board and each principal Committee may, at ANZ’s expense, and with the approval of the Chairman, obtain whatever professional advice it requires to assist in its work. 5.5 Meeting director share qualifications 6. Role of company secretaries The Board is responsible for appointing ANZ’s Company Secretaries. The Board has appointed two Company Secretaries. Profiles of ANZ’s Company Secretaries can be found in the Directors’ Report (in the 2019 Annual Report). One of them is the Group General Counsel, Ken Adams. He is responsible for the provision of legal services to ANZ globally. He works closely with the Chairman, Directors and senior management and is responsible to the Board for the Company Secretary’s Office. Within five years of each Non-Executive Director’s appointment, they must accumulate, and then maintain, a holding in ANZ shares that is equivalent to at least 100% of a Non-Executive Director’s base fee. The requirement for the Chairman is 200% of that fee. Each Non-Executive Director is in compliance with this requirement. 5.6 Non-Executive Director and senior executive remuneration The Company Secretary, Simon Pordage, is responsible for the operations of the Company Secretary’s Office including administering Board and Board Committee meetings and associated Board governance requirements for ANZ and its Australian subsidiaries, overseeing the relationship with ANZ’s Share Registrar and administering ANZ’s listed securities, including managing distributions, and communication and lodgment of information with, securities exchanges and corporate regulators. Information about the structure of the Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration and the remuneration of the CEO and other senior executives is set out in the Remuneration Report in the 2019 Annual Report. He is accountable directly to the Board, through the Chair, on all matters to do with the proper functioning of the Board. 5.7 Election at next Annual General Meeting He works closely with the Chair of the Board to develop and maintain ANZ’s corporate governance principles. As allowed by ANZ’s Constitution and the Corporations Act 2001, the Board may appoint a Non-Executive Director of ANZ at any time. But that person must retire at the next Annual General Meeting. If they wish to continue as a Director, they must seek election by shareholders at that Annual General Meeting. The Company Secretary is accountable directly to the Board, through the Chair, on all matters to do with the proper functioning of the Board. 5.8 Directors tenure and retirement ANZ’s Constitution requires a Non-Executive Director who wishes to continue in their role to seek re-election by shareholders every three years. This is consistent with the ASX Listing Rules. In addition, ANZ’s Board Renewal and Performance Evaluation Protocol requires Non-Executive Directors to retire when they have served three consecutive 3-year terms after first being elected by shareholders. 7. Board Committees 7.1 Membership and attendance Each of the principal Board Committees: However, in special circumstances, the Board may invite them to extend their tenure. is comprised solely of independent Non-Executive Directors — and has at least three members; has its own Charter; 5.9 Continuing education for directors ANZ Directors take part in a range of training and continuing education programs relating to their duties and responsibilities as Directors, in addition to a formal induction program. has the power to initiate any special investigations it considers necessary; and has the Board appoint one of its members as Chair. Each Committee also conducts its own continuing education sessions as appropriate and seeks to identify topics as part of their self-assessment. For example, the Audit Committee receives regular briefings on developments in accounting standards. Internal and external experts are engaged, as required, to conduct education sessions. Each year, the Board reviews Board Committee composition. The Chairman is an ex-officio member of each principal Board Committee and is Chair of the EESG Committee and NBO Committee. The CEO is invited to attend Board Committee meetings as appropriate. However, his presence is not automatic and he does not attend if his remuneration is being considered or discussed. Non-Executive Directors may, and are encouraged, to attend meetings of other Committees and are provided with papers for all meetings. Each Board Committee may, within the scope of its responsibilities, have unrestricted access to management, employees and information it considers relevant to the carrying out of its responsibilities under its Charter. Each Board Committee may require the attendance of any ANZ officer or employee, or request the attendance of any external party, at meetings as appropriate. 12 7.2 Audit Committee The Audit Committee is responsible for providing oversight and independent review of: ANZ’s financial reporting principles and policies, controls and procedures; the effectiveness of ANZ’s internal control and risk management framework; the effectiveness of ANZ’s internal control and risk management framework; the work of Internal Audit (IA) which reports directly to the Chair of the Audit Committee — see Section 8.1 of this Statement for more information about IA; the integrity of ANZ’s financial statements and their independent audit, and compliance with related legal and regulatory requirements; prudential supervision procedures and other regulatory requirements (including reporting requirements) to the extent they relate to financial reporting; and reports from major subsidiary audit committees.

Under the Committee Charter: each member of the Audit Committee must be appropriately financially literate; and collectively they must have the appropriate knowledge, skills and experience (including industry experience) to effectively discharge the Committee’s responsibilities. The Board determined Paula Dwyer (Chair) was a ‘financial expert’ under the definition set out in the Audit Committee Charter. Although the Board determined that Paula has the necessary attributes to be a ‘financial expert’ in accordance with those requirements, it is important to note that this does not give Paula additional responsibilities to those of other members of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee meets with the External Auditor and internal auditor without Management being present. The Chair of the Audit Committee meets separately and regularly with IA, the External Auditor and Management. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer is the executive responsible for assisting the Chair of the Committee in connection with the administration and efficient operation of the Committee.

Ethical and responsible decision-making 9.1 Codes of conduct 9.3 Whistleblower protection ANZ has two Codes of Conduct — the Employee Code and the Non-Executive Directors Code (the Codes). The Employee Code supports ANZ’s values and provides ANZ employees with a practical set of guiding principles to help them make fair, balanced and ethical decisions in their day-to-day work. The Non-Executive Directors Code recognises the different responsibilities that Directors have under law and enshrines the same values and principles as the Employee Code. ANZ has a strong values based culture that encourages openness, integrity and accountability. The Whistleblower Policy has been developed to ensure that all current and former employees, officers, associates, contractors and sub-contractors of the ANZ group, including relatives of those aforementioned individuals, can freely and without fear of detriment raise concerns regarding actual or suspected misconduct by ANZ, or anyone connected to the ANZ group, including contraventions of ANZ’s ethical and legal standards. The Codes require honesty, integrity, quality and trust. ANZ employees and Directors are required to demonstrate these behaviours and to comply with the Codes. The Codes are supported by a suite of policies that are reviewed regularly to ensure they reflect any changes in law and otherwise remain fit for purpose. Directors’ compliance with the Non-Executive Directors Code forms part of their usual annual performance review. A whistleblower can make a confidential disclosure under the Policy in a number of ways, including through a Whistleblower Protection Officer, the Whistleblower Program team, or anonymously via phone, email and web-based mechanisms operated by ANZ’s external whistleblower reporting service, operated by a third party provider (Deloitte). ANZ maintains confidentiality of all reports to the fullest extent possible and also protects whistleblowers from retaliation or victimization."}
