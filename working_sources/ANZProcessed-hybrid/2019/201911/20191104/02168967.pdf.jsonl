{"context": "2019 ANNUAL REVIEW"}
{"context": "Brian and Heather Coxon established BJ & HD Coxon Oyster Farmers in 1985 – a time when stocks were plentiful and business was booming. Since that time, the business has faced some difficult times. An ANZ customer for 10 years, Brian has appreciated the bank’s support through those times. “During the algae bloom in 2010 I went to ANZ and pleaded relief. We did not know when things would pick up. I am grateful for ANZ sticking with us through that time”. Brian recently found himself seeking the assistance of one of those agencies, reaching out to the Rural Financial Counselling Services (Southern NSW). The service, which is free, supports rural businesses through ongoing drought, poor production or anything else affecting their business and their life. Fast forward to 2019 and Brian’s business is once again facing difficulties, this time as a result of the drought impacting much of Australia. “When you’re doing it tough it’s all too hard, and the state you are in does not always lead to rational decisions,” says Brian. “The financial counsellor looks at you as a person, as well as a business.” “Oyster farming needs fresh water,” says Brian. “Famine on the land means famine in the sea. The oysters have poor growth, it’s difficult to maintain their condition and they’re harder to sell.” Last year in response to the drought ANZ donated $500,000 to the Financial Counselling Foundation for use by rural counselling agencies working in drought affected communities. Brian looks forward to building up the business again, but he doubts things will ever be as good as they were in 1985. “This business is mostly about loving the lifestyle. People who want to be on the water and love working outdoors in Australia’s oldest aquaculture industry.” Image: Brian Coxon"}

{"context": "Chairman’s message DAVID GONSKI, AC Challenging conditions continued in 2019 and our statutory profit of $6.0 billion was down 7% on the previous year. Cash profit from continuing operations (which excludes non-core items and the discontinued Wealth businesses from statutory profit) was $6.5 billion, flat when compared with the same time last year. Despite those tough conditions, we held our FY19 full year dividend at 160 cents with the final dividend of 80 cents franked at 70%. We recognise how important the dividend, franking and predictability is to shareholders. The Board’s decision to reduce franking to a new base reflects the changed shape of our business and the earnings in our Australian geography. This has been a difficult year for us and Australian banks generally. Intense competition, slow credit growth and increased regulation have combined with lower consumer confidence to create this. While this is reflected in our financial performance – particularly within our Australian Retail and Commercial business – the actions taken in recent years to improve the structure of our bank has us well-placed to meet the industry’s challenges. 4 These actions include returning our Institutional business to profitable growth as well as the progress we have made to simplify the products and services we offer our retail customers in Australia and New Zealand. We started early on our simplification agenda and this work continued throughout the year. Simplification continues to underpin improvement across ANZ. A major milestone was the completion of the sale of our Life Insurance business in Australia to Zurich Financial Services Australia and we have also made significant progress in the sale of our Pensions & Investments business to IOOF. Subject to approval from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), we expect to complete this transaction in the first quarter of 2020. Another highlight was the sale of some of our non-core assets outside of home markets, including our retail banking joint venture in Cambodia, our retail business in Papua New Guinea and our Life Insurance business in New Zealand. This continues the stronger focus on investments and resources in our core strategic retail and commercial businesses in Australia and New Zealand and our Institutional business in Asia Pacific. Unfortunately there have also been challenges. This year we have announced an additional charge of $682 million as a result of an increase in our provisions for remediation work. While our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Shayne Elliott addresses this in his CEO message, I want to assure shareholders that the Board understands the impact fixing the failures of the past has on shareholders and we are working proactively and as quickly as possible to remediate impacted customers. Our self-assessment During the year, APRA asked a range of banks, superannuation funds and insurance companies to take a closer look at their own behaviour and operations."}
{"context": "The self-assessment was a useful exercise where we identified many critical issues across culture, accountability and governance. As we outlined to APRA, the Board and executive team are determined to use this as an opportunity to deepen our self-awareness and to learn from our failings. Importantly, we do not see this as just a compliance measure but as an opportunity to make ANZ a more efficient, more sustainable bank. We will be a simpler, less complex bank once we have implemented our road map for change. We will have fewer products and more effective systems and processes. For customers, we will be easier to deal with and when things do go wrong we will be faster to resolve them. Critically, our regulator will recognise issues identified in our annual attestation are being resolved in a timelier manner and this will flow through to improvements in our comprehensive review."}
{"context": "ANZ recorded its ‘first strike’ last year when around 34% of shares were voted against our Remuneration Report. The Board took this result very seriously and shareholders will note there has been a significant differentiation this year in the remuneration awarded to our Disclosed Executives. Our Chair of the Human Resources Committee, Ilana Atlas, provides more detail in the Remuneration Report. You will note our CEO despite a solid personal performance, has had his remuneration impacted by the broader performance of the Group. In fact, variable remuneration for our Disclosed Executives ranged between 0 and 74% of maximum opportunity. We also enhanced our approach to accountability and consequence management during the year and will continue to hold people to account who fail to meet our standards."}
{"context": "We continued our focus on capital efficiency this year by returning excess capital to shareholders as a result of our simplification agenda. We did this while also maintaining capital levels above APRA’s ‘unquestionably strong’ requirements. In the financial year of 2019 we reduced shares on issue by 42 million (equivalent of $1.1 billion) as part of our $3 billion buy-back. That program concluded in March 2019."}
{"context": "While the Australian housing market is slowly recovering, we expect challenging trading conditions to continue for the foreseeable future. Record low interest rates in Australia and global trade tensions will continue to place pressure on earnings while increased compliance and remediation costs will be closely managed. Competition will also remain in focus with the recently announced inquiry into mortgage pricing. We have acknowledged we have not always done a good job in explaining our position and hope the inquiry enables the opportunity to provide facts on a complex matter. On the regulatory front, both APRA and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand have announced proposals that could lift the amount of capital required to support our New Zealand subsidiary. The final impact of these changes depend on a number of factors. This includes the outcome of consultation, particularly the amount of capital required, the time allowed to achieve it, and the instruments we are permitted to use. Management will maintain its focus on capital efficiency. However, our strong ongoing capital generation capacity will assist in meeting any additional capital requirements. Despite the industry’s challenges, I’m confident we have the team, the balance sheet and the oversight in place to execute effectively against a strategy that will benefit all our stakeholders. On behalf of the Board and myself, I thank our more than 39,000 people for their hard work in supporting our customers and our shareholders. David Gonski, AC CHAIRMAN 5 CEO’s message"}
{"context": "This has been a challenging year of slow economic growth, increased competition, regulatory change and global uncertainty."}
{"context": "The core of our strategy has not changed. Put simply, we will generate decent returns by improving the financial wellbeing of our customers. This year we continued to focus on balance sheet strength, improve our culture, simplify the business and rebuild our team’s capabilities. In doing this, we significantly reduced the cost and risk of operating the bank despite the strong headwinds facing the sector. We are determined to have the right people who listen, learn and adapt. We will put the best tools and insights into the hands of our customers and people. Importantly, we will concentrate our efforts on those particular things that add value to customers – and do them right the first time. This means we must continue to simplify our business, improve our customer proposition and invest in innovations that deliver better customer outcomes and improve the efficiency of our operations. Retail and commercial in Australia had a difficult year. Increased remediation charges, intense competition and record low interest rates have had a significant impact on earnings. 6 While yet to flow through to the balance sheet, management actions and operational improvements have seen a steady recovery in home loan applications in recent months. These volume improvements are expected to be maintained into 2020. New Zealand delivered a solid underlying result in a more competitive environment. As in Australia, compliance and remediation costs contributed to higher operating expenses, while a focus on operational efficiency offset inflation in business-as-usual expenses. There are challenges ahead in New Zealand, particularly in relation to the amount of capital we may be required to hold. However, we are well-advanced in our preparations to manage these proposed impacts in an orderly way. Institutional continued its transformation with a return to profitable growth. While macro conditions had an impact on financial performance in the second half, the business is now generating returns above our cost of capital that provides important diversification given the lower growth in our home markets."}
{"context": "The Royal Commission highlighted many failures the Australian banks needed to quickly remedy. ANZ is not immune from this challenge. This year we announced an additional charge of $682 million as a result of an increase in our provisions for remediation work. We know this is real money and has a real impact on shareholders. But we also know it’s important to fix the mistakes of the past and return money owed to customers as quickly as possible. We are currently resolving identified fee or interest discrepancies with over 3.4 million Australia Retail and Commercial customers. To date our Responsible Banking team has remediated over one million customer accounts. If there is a positive from this work, it is that much of the time and resources being invested in remediating our systems and processes will make us a better bank for our customers and shareholders. It means the mistakes of the past are unlikely to be repeated and when issues arise they will be easier to fix."}
{"context": "Another issue we care about is providing affordable and sustainable housing for Australians and New Zealanders. We do this by encouraging investment in the sector – including our role leading the largest social bond issuance for housing in Australia. We also know we have a role in enhancing environmental sustainability and we are focusing our efforts on energy, water and waste. We have committed to fund and facilitate $50 billion by 2025 towards sustainable solutions for our customers, including initiatives that help improve environmental sustainability, increase access to affordable housing and promote financial wellbeing. This is not philanthropy. It’s really good business for our customers and shareholders given the growth opportunities available in the sector. It’s also a business we are good at given our network and capabilities and an area we expect to grow rapidly in the coming years as the world grapples with environmental challenges."}
{"context": "This year we introduced wide-ranging reforms to the way we pay people. Variable remuneration is now a smaller part of our people’s take-home pay and these reduced bonuses are determined by the overall performance of the bank. This is not about paying our people less. It is an industry-leading initiative that will positively enhance our culture and become an important point of differentiation. It also addresses the negative impact an over-emphasis on individual bonuses within a bank can have on customers and the community. Redesigning how we reward our staff was one of the 16 key initiatives we announced as part of our initial response to the Royal Commission recommendations. As part of this, we also strengthened our accountability frameworks to ensure there are appropriate consequences for the small number of people who do not meet standards of behaviour or performance. Finally, despite this difficult environment, we have made good progress this year and I’d like to thank the more than 39,000 people who turn up for ANZ and work hard every day for our customers. I’m confident we have the right strategy and team to deliver great, sustainable results in the future for our customers, our shareholders and the community."}

Carolyn views Carman’s relationship with ANZ similar to any other partnership. Using our international footprint we have helped connect Carman’s to new markets, particularly in Asia, where there is an abundance of opportunity for Westernised products. “ANZ is a partner with us – the reality is ANZ is trying to make our business better. If our business is better, we are going to do more business with ANZ. We are all in this together.” “ANZ’s presence in Asia gives you introductions you would not have otherwise because of their connections. It is really impressive for an Australian bank to have that presence,” says Carolyn. There is much ANZ can learn from Carman’s success, particularly given Carolyn puts that success down to a focus on the customer and having an engaged and passionate workforce – both central elements of ANZ’s own strategy.

{"context": "APRA Self-Assessment The Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry (the Royal Commission) has had a profound impact on our organisation. We are determined to learn from our failures and build a bank that is worthy of the trust and respect of our customers and the community. In late 2018, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) asked a range of financial services companies, including ANZ, to examine through a Self-Assessment Report their behaviours and operations in the wake of highly publicised misconduct in the sector. The Commission’s report led us to further examine how we serve our customers. We identified eight lessons from our misconduct and failures to meet community standards and expectations. These lessons have informed our response to the ‘spirit and letter’ of the Royal Commission. We are now identifying measures that will allow us to be confident that these lessons have been acted on. We submitted our Self-Assessment Report to APRA in November 2018, and have since developed a ‘roadmap’ to act on the themes raised in that report. We identified five focus areas in which to concentrate our efforts to deliver better outcomes. These areas were identified both through the self-assessment as well as issues that were examined by the Royal Commission. Our first step was to identify which Commission recommendations we could quickly act on. This led to 16 initiatives to improve the treatment of our retail customers, small businesses and farmers in Australia.

We are developing a housing supply pipeline through direct engagement with our clients (new and existing), supporting innovative models to finance new supply. This includes: jointly arranging the inaugural bond issue of $315 million for the Commonwealth’s National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (NHFIC), the largest social bond for housing in Australia; and arranging the first wellbeing bonds in New Zealand for Housing New Zealand Corporation (NZ$500 million and NZ$600 million). We have also established a Housing Virtual Fund (the Fund) enabling us to accommodate non-conforming risk aspects of new housing models. Emerging housing models generally come with increased risk for the developer, the bank and the consumer, preventing innovative models from being brought to market at scale. The Fund ensures that we have a comprehensive internal review process, allowing us to utilise all of our expertise in understanding and managing risk. Support for first home buyers Our research shows that 64 percent of first home buyers are uncertain of what to do when it comes to buying their first property and they want someone they can trust to guide them through the process.1 In response, we are improving the skills of our frontline staff enabling them to provide tailored guidance and support to first home buyers.

We have also developed the most accurate property price predictor in the market to support customers in establishing the value of their future home. We have set aside NZ$100 million so our customers can enjoy warmer, healthier homes while potentially also keeping energy costs down. Last year we began offering our home loan customers (both owner-occupiers and investors) an interest- free home loan top-up (up to NZ$5,000). More than 1,800 interest-free home loans (to the value of NZ$6.3 million) have been drawn down as at 30 September 2019. The top-up offer was also extended to heat pumps in July 2019. In recognition of our commitment to this customer segment ANZ has been named Bank of The Year for First Home Buyers by Canstar for three years running (2017–2019). In addition, in April 2019 we launched a Healthy Home Loan Package, that includes discounts to standard home loan rates, as well as fee waivers across a range of accounts, for customers buying, building or renovating a home to 6 Homestar or above, in New Zealand. Industry insights During the year we have undertaken significant engagement with industry stakeholders to ensure that as an organisation we are directly linked to the housing policy agenda, offering market expertise to support government, customers and the community with relevant insights to inform decision-making. Thirty four customers are now on the package (funds under management of NZ$11.7 million) and we are working to identify existing eligible customers to transition them across to the package. Not only are there health benefits associated with more energy efficient homes but occupants may also have more disposable income because they are paying lower power bills. We have entered into a three-year partnership with CoreLogic to deliver a bi-annual housing affordability report.

We are currently resolving identified fee or interest discrepancies with over 3.4 million Retail and Commercial customers. To date our Australian Retail and Commercial Responsible Banking team has remediated over one million customer accounts5 and issued refunds of around $62 million. One way in which we measure the experience of our customers is through Net Promoter Score. Net Promotor Score enables us to gauge whether we are meeting customer needs and expectations and how we are performing relative to peers. It is measured by asking customers how likely they are to recommend ANZ (on a 0–10 scale) and is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors (those who give a score of 0–6) from the percentage of promoters (those who give a 9 or 10). In Wealth, the team has completed the first stage of a review to identify instances of inappropriate advice to customers. Over 7,000 advice cases, spanning more than a decade, were reviewed. In addition, the majority of remediation cases relating to ANZ Financial Planning ‘fee for no service’ have now been remediated. With respect to our Australian and New Zealand Retail and Commercial customers we failed to meet our target to improve our Net Promoter Score relative to peers. Our Institutional ranking remains at number one in both Australia and New Zealand. $ Wealth has remediated nearly 26,000 cases in total and made payments of $95.2m as at 30 September 2019. Over the 12 months to 30 September 2019, the Responsible Banking team has increased the number of dedicated remediation resources working on large scale customer remediation matters from around 150 to around 275 people. Managing customer complaints Listening to our customers and responding to their complaints in a timely, transparent and fair way is key to maintaining their confidence and trust in us. This year, both the Australian Financial Complaints Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission identified the need for significant improvement in our internal dispute resolution. High complaint volumes and lengthy delays in resolution were highlighted. We have established a detailed action plan which sets out the changes we need to make to improve our customers’ experience and we will keep stakeholders informed of our progress. Similarly, the team within Wealth has expanded from around 120 to around 170 over the same time period and is projected to increase to around 200 by December 2019. Our New Zealand business also has almost 60 dedicated remediation resources. These additional resources, together with an increase in infrastructure and capability, are enabling us to refund impacted customers in a scalable and repeatable way. For further information on our approach to complaints handling, complaint volumes and the role of our Customer Advocate refer to our 2019 ESG Supplement available at anz.com/cs in December. More than 500 people throughout the Australian Retail and Commercial business are also working on a number of smaller customer remediations, fixes and investigations. We are delivering an ongoing education program to share ‘lessons learnt’ and to highlight the impacts on customers when we fail to get it right. In creating a collective understanding of the root causes of our existing remediations, we continue to build a shared accountability for the prevention of future issues. 1.

Of the 2.8 million customers using our ANZ app, 36 percent are using mobile banking only – up 30 percent this year, demonstrating the significant shift in how customers are choosing to engage with us. We are implementing digital solutions to assist our customers to improve their financial wellbeing. We have developed new features in the ANZ app to help our customers work towards their financial objectives by setting and tracking goals. Currently in the pilot phase, new features include data-driven ‘nudges’ (messages) to customers via the app, with milestones and tips to help them meet their savings goals. This digital banking evolution brings both opportunities and challenges for ANZ. We are tailoring our products and services to the changing habits of our customers, who have told us they want more flexibility in their banking. Our digital technology now makes it possible for our customers to serve themselves, anywhere, anytime and we are adapting the way we operate to accommodate this.

{"context": "As our customers choose to move their banking to digital platforms we are focused on safeguarding their money and personal information. We have invested heavily in our cyber security capability, and are in a strong position to keep our systems, data and customers safe from the increasing pace, scale and sophistication of cyber-attacks. Open banking regulation came into force at the start of July in Australia, supporting the sharing of generic product data with third parties, with the aim of making it easier for customers to compare products. The sharing of customer specific data will start in early 2020. This will enable consumers to access data about themselves (personal, account and transaction data) and share it with accredited third parties of their choice. At the heart of open banking is trust in how open banking participants manage their customers’ data. We will continue to invest in our customers’ security and privacy, and apply our ethical principles to all data use and the outcomes that result. Recognising humans play a significant role in the security ‘ecosystem’, we are delivering comprehensive education programs for employees and customers, simplifying cyber security, and making it easier to understand and implement. This year we have developed workshops to help small businesses stay safe online, raised awareness of online scams and reached millions of customers through our campaign to help them protect their ‘virtual’ valuables. We are also helping to develop the cyber security curriculum for Australian high schools to ‘grow’ the next generation of cyber security workers. Our Data Ethics Principles put our customers’ interests first in how their data is collected, used and disclosed; and provide mechanisms for transparency and choice to help our customers understand and control their personal information. Promoting a culture where security is everyone’s business means we are better placed to protect our systems, data and our customers, and can actively contribute to digital innovation and the economic opportunities a secure online world offers. We will uphold these principles as the open banking regime begins, ensuring our customers can request the sharing of their data, while also maintaining control over where and how their data is used."}
{"context": "“The emerging Australian data economy, sustained by customer- driven data sharing frameworks, should give customers more control in sharing information with confidence. Also, it should create opportunities for business to leverage their expertise, experience and technology into new areas to serve their customers. Businesses that engage with the data sector will have the opportunity to offer better services, and a more precise product to meet customer needs. Their customers should have the opportunity to benefit from enhanced choice and convenience. The efficient use of data, in a secure ecosystem with a strong governance structure, could be tremendously beneficial for businesses and customers alike.” Scott Farrell, Chair of Open Banking Review ANZ was the first Australian bank to enable its customers to make high value payments (up to $25,000) via the ANZ app using their voice. Our voice ID technology allows customers to verify their identity using their voice, rather than a PIN or password. While still an emerging technology, we currently have almost one million customers in Australia registered for voice ID. To date there have been no instances of fraud from a voice biometric breach."}

{"context": "Performance1 In Australia credit growth is slowing, revenue growth is negligible, interest rates are at record lows and regulation has increased substantially. Competition too is intense, particularly in the home loan market. New competitors built to make the most of digital innovations to serve customers are also having an impact. The housing market activity is improving off the back of the lower interest rates, and the removal of investor and interest only lending caps, but it is too soon to call a recovery. Businesses remain cautious and are taking a ‘wait and see’ approach with the economy. Investment continues to be below long- term averages. Momentum has returned in home lending with applications up 34% in the second half of 2019 (compared with the first half ), through improving turnaround times and greater clarity on lending policies, adjustments to lending caps and a major marketing campaign to restore confidence across our distribution channels. We are confident this will flow through to settlements. More than half of our customers now bank digitally and the ANZ App has 2.8 million users making more than $380 million worth of transactions every day. Our ANZ Business Growth Program has created more than 1,300 jobs and participants have increased their revenue by 374% and profit by 461%. Through our network and insights, our customers continue to succeed in Asia and more than 200 have joined us for delegations to China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam and Japan. 2019 was a challenging year for Australia Retail and Commercial, impacted by continued margin erosion, lower average lending volumes (a combination of the external environment and ANZ conservative business settings) and reduction in fee Income. The home loan portfolio, down 3%, was affected by slowing system credit growth, competition and more conservative home loan origination risk settings. Commercial Lending, also down 2%, was driven by lower volumes in Small Business Banking. Customers grew by more than 130,000 in the year to 6.4 million, with 3.6 million customers now digitally active. Deposits also increased in 2019 to $208 billion, with Retail deposits up 1% and Commercial up 5%.

{"context": "Market conditions have been challenging, particularly in the second half of this financial year. This is due to a combination of record low interest rates, high liquidity, low volatility, and heightened geopolitical tensions. Institutional is focused on customers who value us, working within clear priority sectors, sharpening our geographic focus, simplifying products and technology and driving structural efficiencies. Institutional continued to deliver the benefits of a simpler and more disciplined business in 2019, reporting an increase in Cash Profit and growth in the balance sheet. Net Loans and Advances were up 10% while customer deposits grew 6%. China has been adapting to a slowing economy, while the inverted US Treasury yield curve sparked fears of a potential economic recession in the world’s largest economy. Shifts in trade and supply chains due to the US-China trade war have had a positive impact on some markets, particularly in South-East Asia, where ANZ has a presence. ANZ is also well prepared for Brexit with our European branch network and licensing arrangements meaning customers do not need to make changes or open new accounts in order to continue to bank with us in Europe. Following our decision to exit lower returning and non-core customer relationships, Institutional is now in the process of pivoting to responsible and disciplined growth. We have also maintained our focus on reducing costs and capital efficiency. This has delivered leading market positions across key geographies (#1 Australia & NZ, #5 Asia) and #1 in overall relationship quality for the second year running. The sale of Retail, Commercial and SME in Papua New Guinea completed in September 2019 has enabled the business to focus on Institutional banking. The sale of our stake in Royal Bank in Cambodia (completed in July 2019) was also an important step in our simplification strategy. Geographically, Australia, New Zealand and Asia Pacific, Europe & America all delivered profit growth, supported by strong customer revenue growth. Transaction Banking and Loans and Specialised Finance both increased revenue in 2019, up 8% and 7% respectively. Markets revenue was down marginally due to lower Balance Sheet revenue, while Franchise Sales and Franchise Trading both delivered stronger revenue outcomes. Focus on productivity contributed to another year of cost reductions, a result of lower full time equivalent staff, decrease in software amortisation and property efficiencies.

{"context": "The New Zealand economy remains sound with commodity prices remaining solid, population growth still strong and continued low unemployment. GDP growth, however, has slowed. Business and consumer confidence is down due to uncertainty in the international economic outlook. This has resulted in lower business investment and consumer spending. That has meant the historically low official cash rate environment has not provided the economic stimulus many had hoped for. The level of regulatory scrutiny is increasing on all financial services entities in New Zealand and this is increasing compliance costs for the business. The proposed RBNZ capital changes – which are intended to create a stronger and more robust banking industry and are expected to be made public in December 2019. We continued to progress our strategy of simplifying the business and improving customer experience. The OnePath Life insurance business sale was completed in November 2018, as well as other non-core ANZ New Zealand assets Paymark and ANZ Securities. Frontline sales incentives were removed in 2019 to give confidence to customers that any products and services they purchased were sold to them for the right reasons. In striving to be the best bank to help Kiwis own homes, we developed a market leading proposition that includes a “healthy homes” package to better insulate and heat houses. The Commercial and Agri, and Institutional parts of ANZ New Zealand had a major focus on environmental initiatives to assist customers in the economy. Our New Zealand business maintained a leading position in core banking products this year, with ~31% share of mortgages (August 2019), ~34% share of household deposits (August 2019) and ~24% share of KiwiSaver (June 2019). While the operating conditions were more challenging, Retail and Commercial both delivered balance sheet growth in 2019. Retail net loans and advances were up 4% (driven by Home Loan growth), and Commercial lending up 2%. Revenue for the division was however impacted by margin pressure from lower deposit margins and home loan mix changes. Customer deposits grew 3% and customer numbers grew modestly to 2.4 million, of which 1.5 million customers are digitally active. Digital sales were up ~4% and now account for ~ 30% of all retail sales. Within the Wealth unit, superannuation product Kiwisaver continued its strong growth, surpassing $14.5 billion in funds under management.

New Accountability and Consequence Principles set out when and how an accountability review will be conducted following a material risk or audit event, define the various categories of accountability (e.g. direct, indirect, collective) and provide guidelines for the relevant Group Executive to consider in determining appropriate consequences. Appropriate consequences should reflect the severity of the issue and may include, for example, one or more of the following: coaching, counselling, formal warnings, impacts to performance and remuneration outcomes, impacts on promotion, application of malus and ultimately termination of employment for the most serious issues. The Consequence Review Group (CRG), chaired by the CEO, oversees the implementation and ongoing effectiveness of the Accountability and Consequence Framework, being cognisant of its impact on the culture of ANZ. The CRG reviews material risk and audit events and associated accountability and consequences. Our ongoing focus on accountability, consequences and driving a strong risk culture supports our customer commitment that when things go wrong, we fix them quickly and consistently hold executives to account where appropriate. ‘Speak up’ culture We also seek to support a strong ‘speak up’ culture and ensure managers recognise exemplary risk and audit behaviours. The focus on ‘speak up’ is being supported through our New Ways of Leading (NWOL) that are aligned with our purpose and values. NWOL focuses on five behaviours relevant for all employees and imperative for people leaders: be curious, create shared clarity, empower people, connect with empathy and grow people selflessly. We are incorporating culture into leader-led team activities to facilitate open, purposeful conversations about our culture and practices and create a psychologically safe environment for employees to ‘speak up’. We continue to promote and raise employee awareness of the various ways that employees can ‘speak up’ including through initiatives such as the Whistleblower Awareness Week.

We are building the capabilities of our leaders through the introduction of a new leadership feedback survey giving our leaders tangible and actionable feedback on their strengths and development opportunities. We continue to track the demonstration of our NWOL behaviours and our people are telling us through the leadership and engagement surveys that they are seeing their leaders demonstrating improvements across all five behaviours. This year our efforts have focused on enabling social and economic participation through providing employment opportunities for people from under-represented groups (including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, people with disability and refugees). Overall, we are broadly on-track to meet our target to recruit >1,000 people from these groups by the end of FY20, reaching 734 since 2016. Employee engagement: 77% (up from 73% in 2018)1 Our Spectrum Program is designed to offer employment opportunities to the autism community (sometimes described as part of the neurodivergent community) to build fulfilling careers in areas such as cyber security, coding and testing. This year we welcomed additional participants and nearly half of our original cohort moved into permanent ongoing employment with ANZ. In addition, we are building the capabilities critical to delivering our strategy and to future-proofing our workforce, with a focus on investing in our pipeline of data and engineering talent with new roles and development opportunities in data analysis and science. ? 734 people employed from under-represented groups (since 2016) During the year we launched a new social learning platform – Our Way of Learning (OWL). Combining the functionality of a search engine and a social learning network, OWL offers employees free access to internal subject matter experts at ANZ and external content providers and user-generated content. OWL can be accessed by our people anywhere, anytime, and on any device. In 2019 our people undertook almost 1.5 million hours of learning to increase their skills and capabilities, including self-directed learning through OWL. We recognise that addressing the barriers preventing women from being fairly represented in senior roles is the key to closing our gender pay gap. We have a target in place to increase the representation of Women in Leadership to 34.1%2 by the end of the financial year 2020. This year representation has increased by 0.5% (up from 32% as at September 2018). Our progress is monitored monthly by the CEO and an Executive Committee. A summary of our policy position on Diversity and Inclusion can be found at anz.com/corporate governance. We continue to make strong progress in supporting our people’s safety and wellbeing. Our Health and Safety policy, and associated programs, ensure that we provide an environment that enables employees to participate fully in the workplace and perform at their best. This year we have increased our focus on employee wellbeing, encompassing the areas of mental, physical, social and financial wellbeing. We also provide opportunities for our people to contribute to the communities in which they live and work through our giving and volunteering programs. For further detail see page 30."}

{"context": "Social enterprise STREAT provides a bridge to employment for young people experiencing disadvantage. Since it was founded in 2009 it has helped more than 1,500 young people build stability and health back into their lives, while gaining work experience and hospitality qualifications from regular training across STREAT’s businesses. “We have seven cafes, a bakery, a coffee roastery and a daily catering business and we generate 80 percent of our own income through these businesses,” says Bec Scott OAM, STREAT co-founder and Chief Executive Officer. Having a large group of our employees within such close quarters of the café helps the young people with their work experience. “STREAT works to create healthy people and a healthy planet. When you buy a coffee from us you’re creating training and employment opportunities for marginalised young Victorians, helping create change in coffee farming communities around the world and saving tonnes of disposable paper cups going to landfill each year.” says Bec. STREAT’s newest location is a café housed inside ANZ’s campus at 839 Collins Street in Melbourne. Our decision to partner with a social enterprise was a deliberate and considered one. With the opening of our new building this year there was an opportunity to look at the tendering process differently and select a partner that aligned directly with our own values and purpose. Trainees completing STREAT’s six month intensive program will spend two shifts a week at one of STREAT’s cafés. Bec says a strong rapport is built within the office environment over that time and corporate staff often ask about the trainees after they graduate.

{"context": "MoneyMinded – changing attitudes to money Taghrid participated in MoneyMinded through the Brotherhood of St Laurence’s Stepping Stones program. Stepping Stones is a micro- enterprise program offered to women who have migrant, refugee or asylum seeker backgrounds. Originally from Lebanon, Taghrid arrived in Australia 10 years ago with her husband and one-year-old daughter. Keen to start her own business making special occasion cakes she took part in Stepping Stones, completing MoneyMinded in the process. MoneyMinded taught her about prioritising her spending and deciphering between ‘needs and wants’. MoneyMinded has also changed her attitude to money. Taghrid is careful with her money, but she is also finding alternatives so she and her family are not missing out on enjoying life. “I’m not cutting anything, I’m not suffering. But at the same time, if I need something, I have money to buy it in a different way. I cut my coffee, but I enrolled in a gym,” she said. She also learned about the value of having ‘emergency money’. Since completing MoneyMinded Taghrid regularly transfers $50 into a specific savings account, ‘just like paying a bill’. With these savings she was able to buy a replacement car when hers broke down – before MoneyMinded she would have been without a car for several months. Taghrid has clear financial goals now too – a short-term goal of saving for materials for her business and a longer-term goal for her family to buy a home. Image: MoneyMinded participant Taghrid 29"}

We contribute to debate on business, economic, social and environmental issues affecting our customers and shareholders.

This year we introduced ‘double matching’ – for every dollar donated by an employee (up to $5,000 per employee in a tax year) through the program, ANZ donates two dollars. Payment to the Australian Banking Association includes our annual fee as well as expenditure related to communications activity, contribution to the establishment of a not-for-profit Debt Repayment Service, industry initiatives in response to the Royal Commission’s work, and industry reform activity such as the new Banking Code of Practice."}
{"context": "Our employees in New Zealand and Fiji can also donate through payroll to their respective staff foundations (charitable trusts that provide small grants) and ANZ double matches donations. We understand that some of our stakeholders are particularly interested in positions we hold on issues such as data security, privacy and climate change and our membership of industry associations that undertake advocacy on these issues."}
{"context": "Our Volunteer Leave Policy, which applies to permanent, regular and fixed-term employees provides for at least one day of paid volunteer leave each year. It is not the role of any association to represent solely ANZ’s, nor any other single member’s view. It is also not possible for industry associations to obtain a consensus on every issue. There is sometimes disagreement amongst members about the final positions taken by industry associations and even if we do not agree with it, we will participate in discussions. From time to time, we may take positions on certain matters not supported by the relevant industry association. For example, ANZ was the first major bank to support a ‘last resort’ compensation scheme for victims of misconduct. Such a scheme is now public policy."}

{"context": "This year ANZ arranged bonds for both Australia’s National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (NHFIC) and Housing New Zealand Corporation (HNZ), aimed at increasing access and availability of social and affordable housing on both sides of the Tasman. Well received by investors, the bonds – a A$315 million social bond for NHFIC and two wellbeing bonds for HNZ (NZ$500 million and NZ$600 million) – set benchmarks as the first ever capital markets issue for NHFIC and the first wellbeing bonds for HNZ. According to ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott, “One of the areas in which we can impact the community is in the area of housing. This is not about charitable works, it’s about bringing the full force of ANZ, one of the largest financial institutions in the country to bear; to have an impact and to shape the world for good.” A relatively new type of financing, social bonds are structured so the proceeds fund a social purpose. In this case, owning a NHFIC or HNZ bond is an indirect investment into Australia and New Zealand’s social and affordable housing sector. The return is based on the credit-worthiness of the borrower who is responsible for directing the financing to social causes, with an obligation to report accordingly. Partnering with NHFIC and HNZ allowed ANZ to join forces and draw on each organisation’s expertise in order to deliver better outcomes for a range of stakeholders.

The family started apple farming in 1888 and the business has since evolved into a premium supplier of organic apples, cider and spirits. Over the years they have faced many challenges, including bushfires and the collapse of Tasmania’s apple export industry in 1973 (the result of Britain joining the European Common Market). In response, Ian Smith, a third-generation orchardist, built controlled-atmosphere cool stores and began exporting to Asia in How We Creat Value Icons the 1980s. More recently his son Andrew has converted the orchard into an organic farm, in the belief that growing food without the need for chemical fertilisers and pesticides is better for their land, their customers and the Tasmanian environment. Willie Smith’s has had a banking relationship with ANZ for more than 100 years. In June this year members of our Board and Executive visited the cider production facilities and packing shed, meeting with the workers and learning about what matters to them and their local community. “I have worked hard to evolve Willie Smiths into a vertically integrated agribusiness in the last twenty years. The key ingredients have been innovation, hard work and good relationships. I feel confident and comfortable in our working relationship with ANZ,” said Andrew. Supporting the agricultural sector is an important part of ANZ’s history, and banking customers like Willie Smith’s aligns with our focus on helping our customers grow their business sustainably.

{"context": "The successful delivery of the bank’s strategy is dependent on sound risk management. All of the bank’s activities involve – to varying degrees – the analysis, evaluation, acceptance and management of risks or a combination of risks. Sound risk management plays a critical role in positioning us to prepare for, and respond to, opportunities and challenges in our operating environment."}
{"context": "This year we have continued to strengthen our risk management capabilities, focusing on:"}
{"context": "The Board is responsible for establishing and overseeing the Group’s risk management framework. The Board has delegated authority to the Board Risk Committee (BRC) to develop and monitor compliance with the Group’s risk management policies. The Committee reports regularly to the Board on its activities. Culture and conduct • We have initiated a programme of work to build out how we will measure, monitor and manage conduct risk to allow us to better understand and respond to the drivers of poor conduct. This has included introducing new accountability and consequence principles for employees found accountable for material failure and non-compliance as well as recognising positive risk behaviours in our annual performance and remuneration reviews. We have raised employee awareness about our whistleblower processes and made it easier for them to ‘speak up’– including through initiatives such as the inaugural Whistleblower Awareness Week this year. Simplification • Investment has been made in our risk systems, including enhancing our data analytics to improve our ability to identify issues, and more swiftly understand the root causes. Standardisation and simplification of our wholesale risk practices and policies has helped significantly improve time responsiveness thereby delivering a better banker and customer experience. The key pillars of the Group’s risk management framework include: the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS), which sets out the Board’s expectations regarding the degree of risk that the Group is prepared to accept in pursuing its strategic objectives and its operating plan; and the Risk Management Statement (RMS), which describes the Group’s strategy for managing risks and a summary of the key elements of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) that give effect to that strategy. The RMS includes: a description of each material risk; and an overview of how the RMF addresses each risk, with reference to the relevant policies, standards and procedures. It also includes information on how the Group identifies, measures, evaluates, monitors, reports and then either controls or mitigates material risks. The Group operates a Three Lines-of-Defence Model in regard to risk management that helps embed a culture where risk is everyone’s responsibility. The business – as the first line of defence – has day to day ownership of risks and controls and is accountable for identifying and managing its own risks. The Risk Function is the second line of defence, providing a strong and independent oversight of the work undertaken to manage the risk, as well as developing and maintaining the Risk Management Framework. Non-financial risk • We have redesigned our non-financial risk framework in response to feedback that it was too complex. Significant work has been undertaken to simplify our language around operational risk, consolidate our framework documentation, and clarify the requirements and roles and responsibilities of our staff. The final line of defence is Internal Audit and includes independent assurance that evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of both first and second line risk management approaches. We have established a Royal Commission and Self-Assessment Oversight Group to provide oversight of the integrated approach and plans to address the Self-Assessment focus areas and Royal Commission ‘lessons’. This includes, for example, commissioning and reviewing reports on progress in addressing the Self- Assessment focus areas, our 16 Royal Commission commitments and actions by government to respond to the Royal Commission. “ Strong risk management is a necessity if we are to anticipate and navigate ANZ through a changing environment.” Kevin Corbally – Group Chief Risk Officer Links to 2019 Group Performance Framework We continue to operate in a dynamic and challenging external and regulatory environment placing significant demands on the Risk and Compliance function. There were no material breaches of our Group Risk Appetite Statement, and the number of adverse audits fell by a third with management demonstrating accountability for fixing issues in a timely and sustainable manner. While there were many positives from a risk perspective there were some non-financial risk shortcomings from a regulatory, customer and community perspective.

The risk landscape is continually evolving and we are therefore constantly reviewing issues to consider their materiality to the bank’s operations. Two risks we are currently seeking to understand further are: Cyber security risk: while not new, the increasing reliance we have on information security systems to hold our data and our customers’ data requires us to continually invest in and test the adequacy of our safeguards against evolving cyber attacks and new technology.

{"context": "Food, beverage and agriculture Energy: our engagement in this sector is initially focused on customers with thermal coal operations. Some customers see continuing strong demand for high-quality, low-cost Australian thermal coal that will be used in recently built or planned high efficiency, lower emissions (HELE) plants across Asia; their strategy is focused on developing high quality thermal coal assets and they are committed to improving their external disclosures. Other customers have undertaken scenario analysis (aligned with TCFD recommendations), revealing that some of their commodities perform worst under a low-carbon transition; in response they are directing limited expenditure to thermal coal and most of this is in maintenance capital rather than expansion. Some companies are also starting to work with their suppliers and customers to seek to reduce the emissions associated with the use of their mining commodities, ie ‘Scope 3’ emissions. Transport: a significant customer has ambitious plans to expand their electric vehicle fleet in Australia and is building a new distribution centre that will integrate rooftop solar and electric vehicle charging bays. They also plan to enter a renewable energy power purchase agreement (PPA) to lower their carbon footprint and shield themselves from price volatility. Buildings: a number of customers have established net-zero carbon targets that will be achieved largely through improved energy efficiency and onsite solar installations, setting time bound goals to achieve this by 2030. Food, beverage and agriculture: for many of our agribusiness and food producers, the physical risks of climate change (e.g., water availability and supply) represent the most material and immediate risk to their business, rather than transition risks. We have observed these customers are increasingly focused on managing climate-related risks by committing to reduce or remove deforestation from their operations and supply chains. 48"}

{"context": "Following the growth of green bonds in the past three to four years, the Australian and New Zealand sustainable finance market continues to accelerate with the emergence of loans in both green and sustainability-linked formats. These loans are differentiated by how the proceeds are used. Green loans require borrowers to invest in ‘green’ assets such as green buildings, renewable energy or low carbon transport projects. Sustainability-linked loans can be used for general corporate purposes with pricing designed to incentivise improved sustainability performance – for example, reducing emissions and improving employee wellbeing. In the past year, ANZ has arranged and funded the first ever sustainability linked loan in Australia for Adelaide Airport, and the first Climate Bonds Initiative certified green loan in Australia for Investa Commercial Property Fund. We also acted as joint sustainability co-ordinator and bookrunner on a $1.4 billion sustainability-linked loan for Sydney Airport – the first syndicated facility of its kind in Australia as well as the largest in Asia Pacific and the airport sector to date. Pricing of the loan is attached to Sydney Airport’s ESG performance, as measured by an independent third party. Sustainability initiatives include investment in electric vehicles, an ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025 and cutting carbon emissions per passenger by 50 percent from 2010 levels by 2025. In a first for the New Zealand market, we also led the successful completion of a NZ$50 million sustainability-linked loan for dairy company Synlait Milk Ltd. “Linking our financial arrangements to our ESG performance made perfect sense”, said Nigel Greenwood, Synlait Chief Financial Officer. “It reinforces to our shareholders and stakeholders that we are committed to continuously improving our performance and disclosure, and aligns with our company purpose.” ANZ expects companies will become more receptive to these types of sustainable finance products as climate change and sustainable development move into the fore of their corporate strategies and risk assessment."}

The increase in average interest earning assets reflects growth in Institutional banking portfolios and home loan growth in the New Zealand division. Other operating income decreased $163 million (-3%) largely as the result of net divestment impacts of $198 million, a $120 million decrease in net fee and commission income, and $130 million decrease primarily in other income attributable to realised losses on economic hedges against foreign currency denominated revenue streams (which offset favourable foreign currency translations elsewhere in the Group) and a reduction in income from the lenders mortgage insurance business. This was partially offset by higher Markets other operating income of $154 million, a $79 million increase in share of associate’s profit and a $52 million decrease in customer remediation within other operating income. Operating expenses decreased $330 million (-4%) primarily due to an accelerated software amortisation charge in the prior period of $251 million, lower restructuring expenses of $150 million, a reduction in expenses following the sale of OnePath Life (NZ) and Asia Retail and Wealth businesses of $60 million, lower Royal Commission legal costs of $40 million and lower FTE.

Sale to IOOF Holdings Limited (IOOF) On 17 October 2017, the Group announced it had agreed to sell its OnePath P&I and ADGs businesses to IOOF. The aligned dealer groups business consists of ADGs that operate under their own Australian Financial Services licences. The sale of the ADGs completed on 1 October 2018. On 17 October 2019 the Group announced it had agreed a revised sale price for its OnePath P&I business and ADG to IOOF of $850 million, being a $125 million reduction from the original sale price of $975 million announced in October 2017. The new price of $850 million, includes approximately $25 million that ANZ has already received for the sale of ADGs in October 2018. The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements. Subject to APRA approval the Group expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. The impact of the reduction in price has been reflected in the 2019 financial results. Sale to Zurich Financial Services Australia (Zurich) On 12 December 2017, ANZ announced that it had agreed to the sale of its life insurance business to Zurich and regulatory approval was obtained on 10 October 2018. The transaction was completed on 31 May 2019. Included in the ‘Cash loss from discontinued operations’ is: A $23 million loss ($81 million loss after tax) was recognised in the 2019 financial year. This is attributable to sale related adjustments and write-downs, the reversal of the life-to-date cash profit adjustments on the revaluation of policy liabilities sold to Zurich, partially offset by the recycling of gains previously deferred in equity reserves on sale completion. A $632 million loss (pre and post-tax) was recognised on the reclassification of Wealth Australia businesses to held for sale in the 2018 financial year; and Customer remediation which includes provisions for expected refunds to customers and related remediation costs associated with inappropriate advice or services not provided in the pensions and investments and life insurance businesses. An amount of $241 million pre-tax, $207 million post tax was recognised in the 2019 financial year (2018: $181m pre-tax, $127 million post-tax). ANZ’s lenders mortgage insurance, share investing, general insurance distribution and financial planning businesses which were previously part of the continuing operations of Wealth Australia now form part of the Australia Retail and Commercial division (previously named Australia division) and Wealth Australia ceases to exist as a continuing division."}
{"context": "ANZ shares held by the Group in Wealth Australia discontinued operations are deemed to be Treasury shares for accounting purposes. Dividends and realised and unrealised gains and losses from these shares are reversed as they are not permitted to be recognised as income for statutory reporting purposes. In deriving cash profit, these earnings are included to ensure there is no asymmetrical impact on the Group’s profits because the Treasury shares are held to support policy liabilities which are revalued through the Income Statement. With the sale completion of the life insurance business to Zurich, there are no further ANZ shares held by the Group in discontinued operations (2018: 15.5 million shares)."}
{"context": "When calculating policy liabilities, the projected future cash flows on insurance contracts are discounted to reflect the present value of the obligation, with the impact of changes in the market discount rate in each period being reflected in the Income Statement. ANZ includes the impact on the re-measurement of the insurance contract attributable to changes in market discount rates as an adjustment to statutory profit to remove the volatility attributable to changes in market interest rates which reverts to zero over the life of the insurance contract. With the sale completion of the life insurance business to Zurich, the 2019 financial year includes the reversal of the life-to-date cash profit adjustments on the revaluation of policy liabilities sold, reducing cash profit by $15 million. 2019 $m 2018 $m Statutory profit/(loss) from discontinued operations (343) (695)"}
