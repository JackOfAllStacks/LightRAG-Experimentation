    "2019 ANNUAL REPORT",
    "Brian and Heather Coxon established BJ & HD Coxon Oyster Farmers in 1985 – a time when stocks were plentiful and business was booming. Since that time, the business has faced some difficult times. An ANZ customer for 10 years, Brian has appreciated the bank’s support through those times. “During the algae bloom in 2010 I went to ANZ and pleaded relief. We did not know when things would pick up. I am grateful for ANZ sticking with us through that time”. Brian recently found himself seeking the assistance of one of those agencies, reaching out to the Rural Financial Counselling Services (Southern NSW). The service, which is free, supports rural businesses through ongoing drought, poor production or anything else affecting their business and their life. Fast forward to 2019 and Brian’s business is once again facing difficulties, this time as a result of the drought impacting much of Australia. “When you’re doing it tough it’s all too hard, and the state you are in does not always lead to rational decisions,” says Brian. “The financial counsellor looks at you as a person, as well as a business.” “Oyster farming needs fresh water,” says Brian. “Famine on the land means famine in the sea. The oysters have poor growth, it’s difficult to maintain their condition and they’re harder to sell.” Last year in response to the drought ANZ donated $500,000 to the Financial Counselling Foundation for use by rural counselling agencies working in drought affected communities. Brian looks forward to building up the business again, but he doubts things will ever be as good as they were in 1985. “This business is mostly about loving the lifestyle. People who want to be on the water and love working outdoors in Australia’s oldest aquaculture industry.” Image: Brian Coxon",

    "Chairman’s message DAVID GONSKI, AC Challenging conditions continued in 2019 and our statutory profit of $6.0 billion was down 7% on the previous year. Cash profit from continuing operations (which excludes non-core items and the discontinued Wealth businesses from statutory profit) was $6.5 billion, flat when compared with the same time last year. Despite those tough conditions, we held our FY19 full year dividend at 160 cents with the final dividend of 80 cents franked at 70%. We recognise how important the dividend, franking and predictability is to shareholders. The Board’s decision to reduce franking to a new base reflects the changed shape of our business and the earnings in our Australian geography. This has been a difficult year for us and Australian banks generally. Intense competition, slow credit growth and increased regulation have combined with lower consumer confidence to create this. While this is reflected in our financial performance – particularly within our Australian Retail and Commercial business – the actions taken in recent years to improve the structure of our bank has us well-placed to meet the industry’s challenges. 4 These actions include returning our Institutional business to profitable growth as well as the progress we have made to simplify the products and services we offer our retail customers in Australia and New Zealand. We started early on our simplification agenda and this work continued throughout the year. Simplification continues to underpin improvement across ANZ. A major milestone was the completion of the sale of our Life Insurance business in Australia to Zurich Financial Services Australia and we have also made significant progress in the sale of our Pensions & Investments business to IOOF. Subject to approval from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), we expect to complete this transaction in the first quarter of 2020. Another highlight was the sale of some of our non-core assets outside of home markets, including our retail banking joint venture in Cambodia, our retail business in Papua New Guinea and our Life Insurance business in New Zealand. This continues the stronger focus on investments and resources in our core strategic retail and commercial businesses in Australia and New Zealand and our Institutional business in Asia Pacific. Unfortunately there have also been challenges. This year we have announced an additional charge of $682 million as a result of an increase in our provisions for remediation work. While our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Shayne Elliott addresses this in his CEO message, I want to assure shareholders that the Board understands the impact fixing the failures of the past has on shareholders and we are working proactively and as quickly as possible to remediate impacted customers. Our self-assessment During the year, APRA asked a range of banks, superannuation funds and insurance companies to take a closer look at their own behaviour and operations.",
    "The self-assessment was a useful exercise where we identified many critical issues across culture, accountability and governance. As we outlined to APRA, the Board and executive team are determined to use this as an opportunity to deepen our self-awareness and to learn from our failings. Importantly, we do not see this as just a compliance measure but as an opportunity to make ANZ a more efficient, more sustainable bank. We will be a simpler, less complex bank once we have implemented our road map for change. We will have fewer products and more effective systems and processes. For customers, we will be easier to deal with and when things do go wrong we will be faster to resolve them. Critically, our regulator will recognise issues identified in our annual attestation are being resolved in a timelier manner and this will flow through to improvements in our comprehensive review.",
    "ANZ recorded its ‘first strike’ last year when around 34% of shares were voted against our Remuneration Report. The Board took this result very seriously and shareholders will note there has been a significant differentiation this year in the remuneration awarded to our Disclosed Executives. Our Chair of the Human Resources Committee, Ilana Atlas, provides more detail in the Remuneration Report. You will note our CEO despite a solid personal performance, has had his remuneration impacted by the broader performance of the Group. In fact, variable remuneration for our Disclosed Executives ranged between 0 and 74% of maximum opportunity. We also enhanced our approach to accountability and consequence management during the year and will continue to hold people to account who fail to meet our standards.",
    "We continued our focus on capital efficiency this year by returning excess capital to shareholders as a result of our simplification agenda. We did this while also maintaining capital levels above APRA’s ‘unquestionably strong’ requirements. In the financial year of 2019 we reduced shares on issue by 42 million (equivalent of $1.1 billion) as part of our $3 billion buy-back. That program concluded in March 2019.",
    "While the Australian housing market is slowly recovering, we expect challenging trading conditions to continue for the foreseeable future. Record low interest rates in Australia and global trade tensions will continue to place pressure on earnings while increased compliance and remediation costs will be closely managed. Competition will also remain in focus with the recently announced inquiry into mortgage pricing. We have acknowledged we have not always done a good job in explaining our position and hope the inquiry enables the opportunity to provide facts on a complex matter. On the regulatory front, both APRA and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand have announced proposals that could lift the amount of capital required to support our New Zealand subsidiary. The final impact of these changes depend on a number of factors. This includes the outcome of consultation, particularly the amount of capital required, the time allowed to achieve it, and the instruments we are permitted to use. Management will maintain its focus on capital efficiency. However, our strong ongoing capital generation capacity will assist in meeting any additional capital requirements. Despite the industry’s challenges, I’m confident we have the team, the balance sheet and the oversight in place to execute effectively against a strategy that will benefit all our stakeholders. On behalf of the Board and myself, I thank our more than 39,000 people for their hard work in supporting our customers and our shareholders. David Gonski, AC CHAIRMAN 5 CEO’s message",
    "This has been a challenging year of slow economic growth, increased competition, regulatory change and global uncertainty.",
    "The core of our strategy has not changed. Put simply, we will generate decent returns by improving the financial wellbeing of our customers. This year we continued to focus on balance sheet strength, improve our culture, simplify the business and rebuild our team’s capabilities. In doing this, we significantly reduced the cost and risk of operating the bank despite the strong headwinds facing the sector. We are determined to have the right people who listen, learn and adapt. We will put the best tools and insights into the hands of our customers and people. Importantly, we will concentrate our efforts on those particular things that add value to customers – and do them right the first time. This means we must continue to simplify our business, improve our customer proposition and invest in innovations that deliver better customer outcomes and improve the efficiency of our operations. Retail and commercial in Australia had a difficult year. Increased remediation charges, intense competition and record low interest rates have had a significant impact on earnings. 6 While yet to flow through to the balance sheet, management actions and operational improvements have seen a steady recovery in home loan applications in recent months. These volume improvements are expected to be maintained into 2020. New Zealand delivered a solid underlying result in a more competitive environment. As in Australia, compliance and remediation costs contributed to higher operating expenses, while a focus on operational efficiency offset inflation in business-as-usual expenses. There are challenges ahead in New Zealand, particularly in relation to the amount of capital we may be required to hold. However, we are well-advanced in our preparations to manage these proposed impacts in an orderly way. Institutional continued its transformation with a return to profitable growth. While macro conditions had an impact on financial performance in the second half, the business is now generating returns above our cost of capital that provides important diversification given the lower growth in our home markets.",
    "The Royal Commission highlighted many failures the Australian banks needed to quickly remedy. ANZ is not immune from this challenge. This year we announced an additional charge of $682 million as a result of an increase in our provisions for remediation work. We know this is real money and has a real impact on shareholders. But we also know it’s important to fix the mistakes of the past and return money owed to customers as quickly as possible. We are currently resolving identified fee or interest discrepancies with over 3.4 million Australia Retail and Commercial customers. To date our Responsible Banking team has remediated over one million customer accounts. If there is a positive from this work, it is that much of the time and resources being invested in remediating our systems and processes will make us a better bank for our customers and shareholders. It means the mistakes of the past are unlikely to be repeated and when issues arise they will be easier to fix.",
    "Another issue we care about is providing affordable and sustainable housing for Australians and New Zealanders. We do this by encouraging investment in the sector – including our role leading the largest social bond issuance for housing in Australia. We also know we have a role in enhancing environmental sustainability and we are focusing our efforts on energy, water and waste. We have committed to fund and facilitate $50 billion by 2025 towards sustainable solutions for our customers, including initiatives that help improve environmental sustainability, increase access to affordable housing and promote financial wellbeing. This is not philanthropy. It’s really good business for our customers and shareholders given the growth opportunities available in the sector. It’s also a business we are good at given our network and capabilities and an area we expect to grow rapidly in the coming years as the world grapples with environmental challenges.",
    "This year we introduced wide-ranging reforms to the way we pay people. Variable remuneration is now a smaller part of our people’s take-home pay and these reduced bonuses are determined by the overall performance of the bank. This is not about paying our people less. It is an industry-leading initiative that will positively enhance our culture and become an important point of differentiation. It also addresses the negative impact an over-emphasis on individual bonuses within a bank can have on customers and the community. Redesigning how we reward our staff was one of the 16 key initiatives we announced as part of our initial response to the Royal Commission recommendations. As part of this, we also strengthened our accountability frameworks to ensure there are appropriate consequences for the small number of people who do not meet standards of behaviour or performance. Finally, despite this difficult environment, we have made good progress this year and I’d like to thank the more than 39,000 people who turn up for ANZ and work hard every day for our customers. I’m confident we have the right strategy and team to deliver great, sustainable results in the future for our customers, our shareholders and the community.",

Within our Institutional business we are creating an integrated trade, cash and markets experience, while developing and appropriately scaling our capabilities across geographies to deliver connectivity for our customers. While our focus has evolved over the past four years, the strategic imperatives remain the same: creating a simpler, better balanced bank; focusing our efforts where we can carve out a winning position; building a superior everyday experience to compete in the digital age; and driving a purpose and values led transformation. Our strategy has driven significant improvement in our business over the past four years. We have strengthened our balance sheet, improved our culture, simplified the business and rebuilt our people’s capabilities.

We are determined to learn from our failures and build a bank that is worthy of the trust and respect of our customers and the community. In late 2018, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) asked a range of financial services companies, including ANZ, to examine through a Self-Assessment Report their behaviours and operations in the wake of highly publicised misconduct in the sector. The Commission’s report led us to further examine how we serve our customers. We identified eight lessons from our misconduct and failures to meet community standards and expectations. These lessons have informed our response to the ‘spirit and letter’ of the Royal Commission. We are now identifying measures that will allow us to be confident that these lessons have been acted on. We submitted our Self-Assessment Report to APRA in November 2018, and have since developed a ‘roadmap’ to act on the themes raised in that report. We identified five focus areas in which to concentrate our efforts to deliver better outcomes. These areas were identified both through the self-assessment as well as issues that were examined by the Royal Commission. Our first step was to identify which Commission recommendations we could quickly act on. This led to 16 initiatives to improve the treatment of our retail customers, small businesses and farmers in Australia. Some of the key commitments we have delivered on are: removing overdrawn and dishonour fees on our Pensioner Advantage account (available to eligible recipients of Centrelink or Veterans’ Affairs pensions)",

    "including how we are held to account, and how we manage and execute change",
    "implementing pay reforms that replace individual-based bonuses for most of our employees with an incentive based on the overall performance of the Group. In addition to progressing these 16 initiatives, Colin Neave, former Commonwealth Ombudsman and our first Customer Fairness Adviser (appointed in 2016), reviewed individual ANZ cases highlighted at the Royal Commission, taking action where appropriate to resolve matters.",
    "The majority of the recommendations in the Royal Commission final report require legislative change and we will continue to work with government as it implements those changes. Executive Committee members have been assigned ‘ownership’ of each focus area and they are responsible for monitoring performance. We have established a Royal Commission and Self-Assessment Oversight Group to oversee an integrated response to the Royal Commission and Self-Assessment. Further details of our self-assessment can be found on bluenotes at anz.com. 16",
    "Consistently delivering a positive customer experience enables us to create value for all of our stakeholders and is critical to our long-term success. We seek to treat our customers fairly and responsibly, providing them with suitable and appropriate products and services, supported by strong data protection. Links to 2019 Group Performance Framework We have identified three customer segments where we believe we can best achieve this: home owners, business owners and companies that move capital and goods across the region.",
    "We are committed to improving the customer experience, as highlighted by the implementation of 16 initiatives in Australia in response to the Royal Commission. There were some challenges during the year including technology stability issues, and a period of underperformance in respect of assessment and approval times relative to peers in home lending. Institutional performance in key customer satisfaction/relationship strength surveys continued to be a highlight, along with strong digital engagement with customers.

    "We are committed to fund and facilitate $1 billion of investment by 2023 to deliver around 3,200 more affordable, secure and sustainable homes to buy and rent in Australia. We are developing a housing supply pipeline through direct engagement with our clients (new and existing), supporting innovative models to finance new supply. This includes: jointly arranging the inaugural bond issue of $315 million for the Commonwealth’s National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (NHFIC), the largest social bond for housing in Australia; and arranging the first wellbeing bonds in New Zealand for Housing New Zealand Corporation (NZ$500 million and NZ$600 million). We have also established a Housing Virtual Fund (the Fund) enabling us to accommodate non-conforming risk aspects of new housing models. Emerging housing models generally come with increased risk for the developer, the bank and the consumer, preventing innovative models from being brought to market at scale. The Fund ensures that we have a comprehensive internal review process, allowing us to utilise all of our expertise in understanding and managing risk. Support for first home buyers Our research shows that 64 percent of first home buyers are uncertain of what to do when it comes to buying their first property and they want someone they can trust to guide them through the process.1 In response, we are improving the skills of our frontline staff enabling them to provide tailored guidance and support to first home buyers. We have: provided more than 3,300 frontline staff with Home Loan Coach training across Australia and New Zealand;",
    "According to research by the Building Research Association of New Zealand, about half of the homes built are unsuitable for the climate – they are not adequately insulated, have insufficient heating and are damp with visible signs of mould. “As New Zealand’s biggest home lender, housing is one area where we want to make a difference”, says Antonia Watson, Acting Chief Executive Officer, New Zealand. improved our First Home Coach training in Australia – nearly 800 of our frontline staff have completed this training; and provided Construction Coach training in New Zealand to support customers building or renovating a home – more than 220 frontline staff have received training. We have also developed the most accurate property price predictor in the market to support customers in establishing the value of their future home. We have set aside NZ$100 million so our customers can enjoy warmer, healthier homes while potentially also keeping energy costs down. Last year we began offering our home loan customers (both owner-occupiers and investors) an interest- free home loan top-up (up to NZ$5,000). More than 1,800 interest-free home loans (to the value of NZ$6.3 million) have been drawn down as at 30 September 2019. The top-up offer was also extended to heat pumps in July 2019. In recognition of our commitment to this customer segment ANZ has been named Bank of The Year for First Home Buyers by Canstar for three years running (2017–2019). In addition, in April 2019 we launched a Healthy Home Loan Package, that includes discounts to standard home loan rates, as well as fee waivers across a range of accounts, for customers buying, building or renovating a home to 6 Homestar or above, in New Zealand. Industry insights During the year we have undertaken significant engagement with industry stakeholders to ensure that as an organisation we are directly linked to the housing policy agenda, offering market expertise to support government, customers and the community with relevant insights to inform decision-making. Thirty four customers are now on the package (funds under management of NZ$11.7 million) and we are working to identify existing eligible customers to transition them across to the package. Not only are there health benefits associated with more energy efficient homes but occupants may also have more disposable income because they are paying lower power bills. We have entered into a three-year partnership with CoreLogic to deliver a bi-annual housing affordability report. The report provides in-depth market analysis of the Australian housing market for both buyers and renters. “When every dollar counts, a lower home loan rate might swing the decision to go the extra mile on health and sustainability measures.” says Antonia. 1.

    "Fair, responsible and efficient customer remediation is a focus for the bank, with significant investment being made across our Australia, Wealth and New Zealand Divisions. We are currently resolving identified fee or interest discrepancies with over 3.4 million Retail and Commercial customers. To date our Australian Retail and Commercial Responsible Banking team has remediated over one million customer accounts5 and issued refunds of around $62 million. One way in which we measure the experience of our customers is through Net Promoter Score. Net Promotor Score enables us to gauge whether we are meeting customer needs and expectations and how we are performing relative to peers. It is measured by asking customers how likely they are to recommend ANZ (on a 0–10 scale) and is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors (those who give a score of 0–6) from the percentage of promoters (those who give a 9 or 10). In Wealth, the team has completed the first stage of a review to identify instances of inappropriate advice to customers. Over 7,000 advice cases, spanning more than a decade, were reviewed. In addition, the majority of remediation cases relating to ANZ Financial Planning ‘fee for no service’ have now been remediated. With respect to our Australian and New Zealand Retail and Commercial customers we failed to meet our target to improve our Net Promoter Score relative to peers. Our Institutional ranking remains at number one in both Australia and New Zealand. $ Wealth has remediated nearly 26,000 cases in total and made payments of $95.2m as at 30 September 2019. Over the 12 months to 30 September 2019, the Responsible Banking team has increased the number of dedicated remediation resources working on large scale customer remediation matters from around 150 to around 275 people. Managing customer complaints Listening to our customers and responding to their complaints in a timely, transparent and fair way is key to maintaining their confidence and trust in us. This year, both the Australian Financial Complaints Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission identified the need for significant improvement in our internal dispute resolution. High complaint volumes and lengthy delays in resolution were highlighted. We have established a detailed action plan which sets out the changes we need to make to improve our customers’ experience and we will keep stakeholders informed of our progress. Similarly, the team within Wealth has expanded from around 120 to around 170 over the same time period and is projected to increase to around 200 by December 2019. Our New Zealand business also has almost 60 dedicated remediation resources. These additional resources, together with an increase in infrastructure and capability, are enabling us to refund impacted customers in a scalable and repeatable way. For further information on our approach to complaints handling, complaint volumes and the role of our Customer Advocate refer to our 2019 ESG Supplement available at anz.com/cs in December. More than 500 people throughout the Australian Retail and Commercial business are also working on a number of smaller customer remediations, fixes and investigations. We are delivering an ongoing education program to share ‘lessons learnt’ and to highlight the impacts on customers when we fail to get it right. In creating a collective understanding of the root causes of our existing remediations, we continue to build a shared accountability for the prevention of future issues. 1.

    "Offering customers more convenient and engaging banking solutions Fifteen years ago more than half of all banking transactions occurred within the branch network; today, that number is down to less than 10 percent. Of the 2.8 million customers using our ANZ app, 36 percent are using mobile banking only – up 30 percent this year, demonstrating the significant shift in how customers are choosing to engage with us. We are implementing digital solutions to assist our customers to improve their financial wellbeing. We have developed new features in the ANZ app to help our customers work towards their financial objectives by setting and tracking goals. Currently in the pilot phase, new features include data-driven ‘nudges’ (messages) to customers via the app, with milestones and tips to help them meet their savings goals. This digital banking evolution brings both opportunities and challenges for ANZ. We are tailoring our products and services to the changing habits of our customers, who have told us they want more flexibility in their banking. Our digital technology now makes it possible for our customers to serve themselves, anywhere, anytime and we are adapting the way we operate to accommodate this. Peak usage on the ANZ app is between 4–6pm, and even during our quietest time between 12–2am we are serving almost 100,000 customers. Of the 2.8 million customers using our ANZ app, 36 percent are using mobile banking only – up 30 percent this year With increasing digitalisation, a strong cyber security capability is critical",
    "As our customers choose to move their banking to digital platforms we are focused on safeguarding their money and personal information. We have invested heavily in our cyber security capability, and are in a strong position to keep our systems, data and customers safe from the increasing pace, scale and sophistication of cyber-attacks. Open banking regulation came into force at the start of July in Australia, supporting the sharing of generic product data with third parties, with the aim of making it easier for customers to compare products. The sharing of customer specific data will start in early 2020. This will enable consumers to access data about themselves (personal, account and transaction data) and share it with accredited third parties of their choice. At the heart of open banking is trust in how open banking participants manage their customers’ data. We will continue to invest in our customers’ security and privacy, and apply our ethical principles to all data use and the outcomes that result. Recognising humans play a significant role in the security ‘ecosystem’, we are delivering comprehensive education programs for employees and customers, simplifying cyber security, and making it easier to understand and implement. This year we have developed workshops to help small businesses stay safe online, raised awareness of online scams and reached millions of customers through our campaign to help them protect their ‘virtual’ valuables. We are also helping to develop the cyber security curriculum for Australian high schools to ‘grow’ the next generation of cyber security workers. Our Data Ethics Principles put our customers’ interests first in how their data is collected, used and disclosed; and provide mechanisms for transparency and choice to help our customers understand and control their personal information. Promoting a culture where security is everyone’s business means we are better placed to protect our systems, data and our customers, and can actively contribute to digital innovation and the economic opportunities a secure online world offers. We will uphold these principles as the open banking regime begins, ensuring our customers can request the sharing of their data, while also maintaining control over where and how their data is used.",
    "“The emerging Australian data economy, sustained by customer- driven data sharing frameworks, should give customers more control in sharing information with confidence. Also, it should create opportunities for business to leverage their expertise, experience and technology into new areas to serve their customers. Businesses that engage with the data sector will have the opportunity to offer better services, and a more precise product to meet customer needs. Their customers should have the opportunity to benefit from enhanced choice and convenience. The efficient use of data, in a secure ecosystem with a strong governance structure, could be tremendously beneficial for businesses and customers alike.” Scott Farrell, Chair of Open Banking Review ANZ was the first Australian bank to enable its customers to make high value payments (up to $25,000) via the ANZ app using their voice. Our voice ID technology allows customers to verify their identity using their voice, rather than a PIN or password. While still an emerging technology, we currently have almost one million customers in Australia registered for voice ID. To date there have been no instances of fraud from a voice biometric breach.",

    "“ While this year has had its challenges, I’m pleased our recent actions have restored momentum in our home loans business and with the progress we’ve made in fixing the failures of the past.” Mark Hand – Group Executive Australia Retail and Commercial Banking",
    "Performance1 In Australia credit growth is slowing, revenue growth is negligible, interest rates are at record lows and regulation has increased substantially. Competition too is intense, particularly in the home loan market. New competitors built to make the most of digital innovations to serve customers are also having an impact. The housing market activity is improving off the back of the lower interest rates, and the removal of investor and interest only lending caps, but it is too soon to call a recovery. Businesses remain cautious and are taking a ‘wait and see’ approach with the economy. Investment continues to be below long- term averages. Momentum has returned in home lending with applications up 34% in the second half of 2019 (compared with the first half ), through improving turnaround times and greater clarity on lending policies, adjustments to lending caps and a major marketing campaign to restore confidence across our distribution channels. We are confident this will flow through to settlements. More than half of our customers now bank digitally and the ANZ App has 2.8 million users making more than $380 million worth of transactions every day. Our ANZ Business Growth Program has created more than 1,300 jobs and participants have increased their revenue by 374% and profit by 461%. Through our network and insights, our customers continue to succeed in Asia and more than 200 have joined us for delegations to China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam and Japan. 2019 was a challenging year for Australia Retail and Commercial, impacted by continued margin erosion, lower average lending volumes (a combination of the external environment and ANZ conservative business settings) and reduction in fee Income. The home loan portfolio, down 3%, was affected by slowing system credit growth, competition and more conservative home loan origination risk settings. Commercial Lending, also down 2%, was driven by lower volumes in Small Business Banking. Customers grew by more than 130,000 in the year to 6.4 million, with 3.6 million customers now digitally active. Deposits also increased in 2019 to $208 billion, with Retail deposits up 1% and Commercial up 5%.

Our focused strategy is delivering results, and we’re staying vigilant in managing risks relating to geopolitics, global trade and consumer retail trends.” Mark Whelan – Group Executive Institutional",
    "Market conditions have been challenging, particularly in the second half of this financial year. This is due to a combination of record low interest rates, high liquidity, low volatility, and heightened geopolitical tensions. Institutional is focused on customers who value us, working within clear priority sectors, sharpening our geographic focus, simplifying products and technology and driving structural efficiencies. Institutional continued to deliver the benefits of a simpler and more disciplined business in 2019, reporting an increase in Cash Profit and growth in the balance sheet. Net Loans and Advances were up 10% while customer deposits grew 6%. China has been adapting to a slowing economy, while the inverted US Treasury yield curve sparked fears of a potential economic recession in the world’s largest economy. Shifts in trade and supply chains due to the US-China trade war have had a positive impact on some markets, particularly in South-East Asia, where ANZ has a presence. ANZ is also well prepared for Brexit with our European branch network and licensing arrangements meaning customers do not need to make changes or open new accounts in order to continue to bank with us in Europe. Following our decision to exit lower returning and non-core customer relationships, Institutional is now in the process of pivoting to responsible and disciplined growth. We have also maintained our focus on reducing costs and capital efficiency. This has delivered leading market positions across key geographies (#1 Australia & NZ, #5 Asia) and #1 in overall relationship quality for the second year running. The sale of Retail, Commercial and SME in Papua New Guinea completed in September 2019 has enabled the business to focus on Institutional banking. The sale of our stake in Royal Bank in Cambodia (completed in July 2019) was also an important step in our simplification strategy. Geographically, Australia, New Zealand and Asia Pacific, Europe & America all delivered profit growth, supported by strong customer revenue growth. Transaction Banking and Loans and Specialised Finance both increased revenue in 2019, up 8% and 7% respectively. Markets revenue was down marginally due to lower Balance Sheet revenue, while Franchise Sales and Franchise Trading both delivered stronger revenue outcomes. Focus on productivity contributed to another year of cost reductions, a result of lower full time equivalent staff, decrease in software amortisation and property efficiencies.

    "The New Zealand economy remains sound with commodity prices remaining solid, population growth still strong and continued low unemployment. GDP growth, however, has slowed. Business and consumer confidence is down due to uncertainty in the international economic outlook. This has resulted in lower business investment and consumer spending. That has meant the historically low official cash rate environment has not provided the economic stimulus many had hoped for. The level of regulatory scrutiny is increasing on all financial services entities in New Zealand and this is increasing compliance costs for the business. The proposed RBNZ capital changes – which are intended to create a stronger and more robust banking industry and are expected to be made public in December 2019. We continued to progress our strategy of simplifying the business and improving customer experience. The OnePath Life insurance business sale was completed in November 2018, as well as other non-core ANZ New Zealand assets Paymark and ANZ Securities. Frontline sales incentives were removed in 2019 to give confidence to customers that any products and services they purchased were sold to them for the right reasons. In striving to be the best bank to help Kiwis own homes, we developed a market leading proposition that includes a “healthy homes” package to better insulate and heat houses. The Commercial and Agri, and Institutional parts of ANZ New Zealand had a major focus on environmental initiatives to assist customers in the economy. Our New Zealand business maintained a leading position in core banking products this year, with ~31% share of mortgages (August 2019), ~34% share of household deposits (August 2019) and ~24% share of KiwiSaver (June 2019). While the operating conditions were more challenging, Retail and Commercial both delivered balance sheet growth in 2019. Retail net loans and advances were up 4% (driven by Home Loan growth), and Commercial lending up 2%. Revenue for the division was however impacted by margin pressure from lower deposit margins and home loan mix changes. Customer deposits grew 3% and customer numbers grew modestly to 2.4 million, of which 1.5 million customers are digitally active. Digital sales were up ~4% and now account for ~ 30% of all retail sales. Within the Wealth unit, superannuation product Kiwisaver continued its strong growth, surpassing $14.5 billion in funds under management. Focus in recent years on more conservative lending standards, together with a benign credit environment, contributed to provision charges remaining low this year.

    "During 2019 we have strengthened the way we deal with risk events through an enhanced Accountability and Consequence Framework, which is applicable to all of our people. New Accountability and Consequence Principles set out when and how an accountability review will be conducted following a material risk or audit event, define the various categories of accountability (e.g. direct, indirect, collective) and provide guidelines for the relevant Group Executive to consider in determining appropriate consequences. Appropriate consequences should reflect the severity of the issue and may include, for example, one or more of the following: coaching, counselling, formal warnings, impacts to performance and remuneration outcomes, impacts on promotion, application of malus and ultimately termination of employment for the most serious issues. The Consequence Review Group (CRG), chaired by the CEO, oversees the implementation and ongoing effectiveness of the Accountability and Consequence Framework, being cognisant of its impact on the culture of ANZ. The CRG reviews material risk and audit events and associated accountability and consequences. Our ongoing focus on accountability, consequences and driving a strong risk culture supports our customer commitment that when things go wrong, we fix them quickly and consistently hold executives to account where appropriate. ‘Speak up’ culture We also seek to support a strong ‘speak up’ culture and ensure managers recognise exemplary risk and audit behaviours. The focus on ‘speak up’ is being supported through our New Ways of Leading (NWOL) that are aligned with our purpose and values. NWOL focuses on five behaviours relevant for all employees and imperative for people leaders: be curious, create shared clarity, empower people, connect with empathy and grow people selflessly. We are incorporating culture into leader-led team activities to facilitate open, purposeful conversations about our culture and practices and create a psychologically safe environment for employees to ‘speak up’. We continue to promote and raise employee awareness of the various ways that employees can ‘speak up’ including through initiatives such as the Whistleblower Awareness Week. We have 39,060 full-time equivalent employees Application of consequences In 2019 across the Group, 151 employees were terminated for breaches of our Code of Conduct.

The changes include rebalancing the way we pay our people so that variable remuneration is a smaller part of take home pay. For the majority of employees, variable remuneration will be based on Group performance only (i.e. no individual bonuses). These changes will apply from financial year 2020, and are more closely aligned to our desired culture, with increased focus on collaboration and team performance, as well as individual growth and development. We are implementing the recommendations from Stephen Sedgwick’s ‘Retail Banking Remuneration Review’, which is focused on strengthening the alignment of retail bank incentives, sales practices and good customer outcomes. Recommendations that ANZ is delivering independently are 90% complete and will be fully implemented well ahead of the October 2020 deadline. We continue to work with industry to progress the recommendations for third parties and principles to underpin customer metrics. Management provides regular updates to the Board Human Resources Committee on progress. 23 12 7 25",
    "Diversity, inclusion and wellbeing We are creating an environment where our people can learn and grow every day, helping us to build organisational agility and capability to remain competitive. We are making progress on our priority to build an engaged, diverse and inclusive workforce. We want our workforce to reflect the communities we serve and believe that leveraging the diversity of our people will allow us to innovate and improve customer experience. We are building the capabilities of our leaders through the introduction of a new leadership feedback survey giving our leaders tangible and actionable feedback on their strengths and development opportunities. We continue to track the demonstration of our NWOL behaviours and our people are telling us through the leadership and engagement surveys that they are seeing their leaders demonstrating improvements across all five behaviours. This year our efforts have focused on enabling social and economic participation through providing employment opportunities for people from under-represented groups (including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, people with disability and refugees). Overall, we are broadly on-track to meet our target to recruit >1,000 people from these groups by the end of FY20, reaching 734 since 2016. Employee engagement: 77% (up from 73% in 2018)1 Our Spectrum Program is designed to offer employment opportunities to the autism community (sometimes described as part of the neurodivergent community) to build fulfilling careers in areas such as cyber security, coding and testing. This year we welcomed additional participants and nearly half of our original cohort moved into permanent ongoing employment with ANZ. In addition, we are building the capabilities critical to delivering our strategy and to future-proofing our workforce, with a focus on investing in our pipeline of data and engineering talent with new roles and development opportunities in data analysis and science. ? 734 people employed from under-represented groups (since 2016) During the year we launched a new social learning platform – Our Way of Learning (OWL). Combining the functionality of a search engine and a social learning network, OWL offers employees free access to internal subject matter experts at ANZ and external content providers and user-generated content. OWL can be accessed by our people anywhere, anytime, and on any device. In 2019 our people undertook almost 1.5 million hours of learning to increase their skills and capabilities, including self-directed learning through OWL. We recognise that addressing the barriers preventing women from being fairly represented in senior roles is the key to closing our gender pay gap. We have a target in place to increase the representation of Women in Leadership to 34.1%2 by the end of the financial year 2020. This year representation has increased by 0.5% (up from 32% as at September 2018). Our progress is monitored monthly by the CEO and an Executive Committee. A summary of our policy position on Diversity and Inclusion can be found at anz.com/corporate governance. We continue to make strong progress in supporting our people’s safety and wellbeing. Our Health and Safety policy, and associated programs, ensure that we provide an environment that enables employees to participate fully in the workplace and perform at their best. This year we have increased our focus on employee wellbeing, encompassing the areas of mental, physical, social and financial wellbeing. We also provide opportunities for our people to contribute to the communities in which they live and work through our giving and volunteering programs. For further detail see page 30.",

    "Social enterprise STREAT provides a bridge to employment for young people experiencing disadvantage. Since it was founded in 2009 it has helped more than 1,500 young people build stability and health back into their lives, while gaining work experience and hospitality qualifications from regular training across STREAT’s businesses. “We have seven cafes, a bakery, a coffee roastery and a daily catering business and we generate 80 percent of our own income through these businesses,” says Bec Scott OAM, STREAT co-founder and Chief Executive Officer. Having a large group of our employees within such close quarters of the café helps the young people with their work experience. “STREAT works to create healthy people and a healthy planet. When you buy a coffee from us you’re creating training and employment opportunities for marginalised young Victorians, helping create change in coffee farming communities around the world and saving tonnes of disposable paper cups going to landfill each year.” says Bec. STREAT’s newest location is a café housed inside ANZ’s campus at 839 Collins Street in Melbourne. Our decision to partner with a social enterprise was a deliberate and considered one. With the opening of our new building this year there was an opportunity to look at the tendering process differently and select a partner that aligned directly with our own values and purpose. Trainees completing STREAT’s six month intensive program will spend two shifts a week at one of STREAT’s cafés. Bec says a strong rapport is built within the office environment over that time and corporate staff often ask about the trainees after they graduate.

Over many years we have invested in community programs, including Saver Plus and MoneyMinded, which have been proven to be an important part of the financial inclusion story for lower- income people. These programs have helped to build financial skills and resilience, develop active savings habits and improve overall financial wellbeing.",
    "Saver Plus – developed by Brotherhood of St Laurence and ANZ in 2003, program participants open an ANZ savings account, set a savings goal and save towards it regularly over 10 months while also attending MoneyMinded financial education sessions. On reaching their goal, savings are matched by ANZ dollar for dollar, up to $500, which must be spent on education. Links to 2019 Group Performance Framework Since 2003, Saver Plus has reached over 43,600 lower-income participants and is expected to enable over $33 million of private sector funds to be invested in education by 2020. Regaining the trust of the community, government and other key stakeholders remains a major focus – our Reptrak community sentiment indicator improved over the 12 months to 58.8 but remains well below pre Royal Commission levels. We have retained high scores in a number of indices: MoneyMinded – this program supports adults with low levels of financial literacy and those on lower incomes across 21 markets, including Australia and New Zealand.

    "MoneyMinded – changing attitudes to money Taghrid participated in MoneyMinded through the Brotherhood of St Laurence’s Stepping Stones program. Stepping Stones is a micro- enterprise program offered to women who have migrant, refugee or asylum seeker backgrounds. Originally from Lebanon, Taghrid arrived in Australia 10 years ago with her husband and one-year-old daughter. Keen to start her own business making special occasion cakes she took part in Stepping Stones, completing MoneyMinded in the process. MoneyMinded taught her about prioritising her spending and deciphering between ‘needs and wants’. MoneyMinded has also changed her attitude to money. Taghrid is careful with her money, but she is also finding alternatives so she and her family are not missing out on enjoying life. “I’m not cutting anything, I’m not suffering. But at the same time, if I need something, I have money to buy it in a different way. I cut my coffee, but I enrolled in a gym,” she said. She also learned about the value of having ‘emergency money’. Since completing MoneyMinded Taghrid regularly transfers $50 into a specific savings account, ‘just like paying a bill’. With these savings she was able to buy a replacement car when hers broke down – before MoneyMinded she would have been without a car for several months. Taghrid has clear financial goals now too – a short-term goal of saving for materials for her business and a longer-term goal for her family to buy a home. Image: MoneyMinded participant Taghrid 29",
    "It is important that we are a part of the communities in which we operate, and we provide many opportunities for our people to get involved through our community programs – volunteering, funding and participating in community projects, or donating through workplace giving. We seek to contribute constructively to policy debate and understand the perspectives of our community’s elected representatives, policy makers and regulators. We contribute to debate on business, economic, social and environmental issues affecting our customers and shareholders. The strength of our relationships with partners in the not-for-profit sector is key to our ability to support the delivery of much needed services to the community.

    "Our workplace giving program enables employees in Australia to make contributions to around 30 charity partners through regular pre-tax payroll deductions. This year we introduced ‘double matching’ – for every dollar donated by an employee (up to $5,000 per employee in a tax year) through the program, ANZ donates two dollars. Payment to the Australian Banking Association includes our annual fee as well as expenditure related to communications activity, contribution to the establishment of a not-for-profit Debt Repayment Service, industry initiatives in response to the Royal Commission’s work, and industry reform activity such as the new Banking Code of Practice.",
    "Our employees in New Zealand and Fiji can also donate through payroll to their respective staff foundations (charitable trusts that provide small grants) and ANZ double matches donations. We understand that some of our stakeholders are particularly interested in positions we hold on issues such as data security, privacy and climate change and our membership of industry associations that undertake advocacy on these issues.",
    "Our Volunteer Leave Policy, which applies to permanent, regular and fixed-term employees provides for at least one day of paid volunteer leave each year. It is not the role of any association to represent solely ANZ’s, nor any other single member’s view. It is also not possible for industry associations to obtain a consensus on every issue. There is sometimes disagreement amongst members about the final positions taken by industry associations and even if we do not agree with it, we will participate in discussions. From time to time, we may take positions on certain matters not supported by the relevant industry association. For example, ANZ was the first major bank to support a ‘last resort’ compensation scheme for victims of misconduct. Such a scheme is now public policy.",
    "Refer to our 2019 ESG Supplement available at anz.com/cs in December for further disclosures, including historical data tables.

    "This year ANZ arranged bonds for both Australia’s National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (NHFIC) and Housing New Zealand Corporation (HNZ), aimed at increasing access and availability of social and affordable housing on both sides of the Tasman. Well received by investors, the bonds – a A$315 million social bond for NHFIC and two wellbeing bonds for HNZ (NZ$500 million and NZ$600 million) – set benchmarks as the first ever capital markets issue for NHFIC and the first wellbeing bonds for HNZ. According to ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott, “One of the areas in which we can impact the community is in the area of housing. This is not about charitable works, it’s about bringing the full force of ANZ, one of the largest financial institutions in the country to bear; to have an impact and to shape the world for good.” A relatively new type of financing, social bonds are structured so the proceeds fund a social purpose. In this case, owning a NHFIC or HNZ bond is an indirect investment into Australia and New Zealand’s social and affordable housing sector. The return is based on the credit-worthiness of the borrower who is responsible for directing the financing to social causes, with an obligation to report accordingly. Partnering with NHFIC and HNZ allowed ANZ to join forces and draw on each organisation’s expertise in order to deliver better outcomes for a range of stakeholders.

    "Willie Smith’s Organic Apples and Cider is a family-run business in Huonville, Tasmania. The family started apple farming in 1888 and the business has since evolved into a premium supplier of organic apples, cider and spirits. Over the years they have faced many challenges, including bushfires and the collapse of Tasmania’s apple export industry in 1973 (the result of Britain joining the European Common Market). In response, Ian Smith, a third-generation orchardist, built controlled-atmosphere cool stores and began exporting to Asia in How We Creat Value Icons the 1980s. More recently his son Andrew has converted the orchard into an organic farm, in the belief that growing food without the need for chemical fertilisers and pesticides is better for their land, their customers and the Tasmanian environment. Willie Smith’s has had a banking relationship with ANZ for more than 100 years. In June this year members of our Board and Executive visited the cider production facilities and packing shed, meeting with the workers and learning about what matters to them and their local community. “I have worked hard to evolve Willie Smiths into a vertically integrated agribusiness in the last twenty years. The key ingredients have been innovation, hard work and good relationships. I feel confident and comfortable in our working relationship with ANZ,” said Andrew. Supporting the agricultural sector is an important part of ANZ’s history, and banking customers like Willie Smith’s aligns with our focus on helping our customers grow their business sustainably.

    "The successful delivery of the bank’s strategy is dependent on sound risk management. All of the bank’s activities involve – to varying degrees – the analysis, evaluation, acceptance and management of risks or a combination of risks. Sound risk management plays a critical role in positioning us to prepare for, and respond to, opportunities and challenges in our operating environment.",
    "This year we have continued to strengthen our risk management capabilities, focusing on:",
    "The Board is responsible for establishing and overseeing the Group’s risk management framework. The Board has delegated authority to the Board Risk Committee (BRC) to develop and monitor compliance with the Group’s risk management policies. The Committee reports regularly to the Board on its activities. Culture and conduct • We have initiated a programme of work to build out how we will measure, monitor and manage conduct risk to allow us to better understand and respond to the drivers of poor conduct. This has included introducing new accountability and consequence principles for employees found accountable for material failure and non-compliance as well as recognising positive risk behaviours in our annual performance and remuneration reviews. We have raised employee awareness about our whistleblower processes and made it easier for them to ‘speak up’– including through initiatives such as the inaugural Whistleblower Awareness Week this year. Simplification • Investment has been made in our risk systems, including enhancing our data analytics to improve our ability to identify issues, and more swiftly understand the root causes. Standardisation and simplification of our wholesale risk practices and policies has helped significantly improve time responsiveness thereby delivering a better banker and customer experience. The key pillars of the Group’s risk management framework include: the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS), which sets out the Board’s expectations regarding the degree of risk that the Group is prepared to accept in pursuing its strategic objectives and its operating plan; and the Risk Management Statement (RMS), which describes the Group’s strategy for managing risks and a summary of the key elements of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) that give effect to that strategy. The RMS includes: a description of each material risk; and an overview of how the RMF addresses each risk, with reference to the relevant policies, standards and procedures. It also includes information on how the Group identifies, measures, evaluates, monitors, reports and then either controls or mitigates material risks. The Group operates a Three Lines-of-Defence Model in regard to risk management that helps embed a culture where risk is everyone’s responsibility. The business – as the first line of defence – has day to day ownership of risks and controls and is accountable for identifying and managing its own risks. The Risk Function is the second line of defence, providing a strong and independent oversight of the work undertaken to manage the risk, as well as developing and maintaining the Risk Management Framework. Non-financial risk • We have redesigned our non-financial risk framework in response to feedback that it was too complex. Significant work has been undertaken to simplify our language around operational risk, consolidate our framework documentation, and clarify the requirements and roles and responsibilities of our staff. The final line of defence is Internal Audit and includes independent assurance that evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of both first and second line risk management approaches. We have established a Royal Commission and Self-Assessment Oversight Group to provide oversight of the integrated approach and plans to address the Self-Assessment focus areas and Royal Commission ‘lessons’. This includes, for example, commissioning and reviewing reports on progress in addressing the Self- Assessment focus areas, our 16 Royal Commission commitments and actions by government to respond to the Royal Commission. “ Strong risk management is a necessity if we are to anticipate and navigate ANZ through a changing environment.” Kevin Corbally – Group Chief Risk Officer Links to 2019 Group Performance Framework We continue to operate in a dynamic and challenging external and regulatory environment placing significant demands on the Risk and Compliance function. There were no material breaches of our Group Risk Appetite Statement, and the number of adverse audits fell by a third with management demonstrating accountability for fixing issues in a timely and sustainable manner. While there were many positives from a risk perspective there were some non- financial risk shortcomings from a regulatory, customer and community perspective. Refer to our Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 98 for further detail. 44",

The risk landscape is continually evolving and we are therefore constantly reviewing issues to consider their materiality to the bank’s operations. Two risks we are currently seeking to understand further are: Cyber security risk: while not new, the increasing reliance we have on information security systems to hold our data and our customers’ data requires us to continually invest in and test the adequacy of our safeguards against evolving cyber attacks and new technology.

    "Food, beverage and agriculture Energy: our engagement in this sector is initially focused on customers with thermal coal operations. Some customers see continuing strong demand for high-quality, low-cost Australian thermal coal that will be used in recently built or planned high efficiency, lower emissions (HELE) plants across Asia; their strategy is focused on developing high quality thermal coal assets and they are committed to improving their external disclosures. Other customers have undertaken scenario analysis (aligned with TCFD recommendations), revealing that some of their commodities perform worst under a low-carbon transition; in response they are directing limited expenditure to thermal coal and most of this is in maintenance capital rather than expansion. Some companies are also starting to work with their suppliers and customers to seek to reduce the emissions associated with the use of their mining commodities, ie ‘Scope 3’ emissions. Transport: a significant customer has ambitious plans to expand their electric vehicle fleet in Australia and is building a new distribution centre that will integrate rooftop solar and electric vehicle charging bays. They also plan to enter a renewable energy power purchase agreement (PPA) to lower their carbon footprint and shield themselves from price volatility. Buildings: a number of customers have established net-zero carbon targets that will be achieved largely through improved energy efficiency and onsite solar installations, setting time bound goals to achieve this by 2030. Food, beverage and agriculture: for many of our agribusiness and food producers, the physical risks of climate change (e.g., water availability and supply) represent the most material and immediate risk to their business, rather than transition risks.

    "Following the growth of green bonds in the past three to four years, the Australian and New Zealand sustainable finance market continues to accelerate with the emergence of loans in both green and sustainability-linked formats. These loans are differentiated by how the proceeds are used. Green loans require borrowers to invest in ‘green’ assets such as green buildings, renewable energy or low carbon transport projects. Sustainability-linked loans can be used for general corporate purposes with pricing designed to incentivise improved sustainability performance – for example, reducing emissions and improving employee wellbeing. In the past year, ANZ has arranged and funded the first ever sustainability linked loan in Australia for Adelaide Airport, and the first Climate Bonds Initiative certified green loan in Australia for Investa Commercial Property Fund. We also acted as joint sustainability co-ordinator and bookrunner on a $1.4 billion sustainability-linked loan for Sydney Airport – the first syndicated facility of its kind in Australia as well as the largest in Asia Pacific and the airport sector to date. Pricing of the loan is attached to Sydney Airport’s ESG performance, as measured by an independent third party. Sustainability initiatives include investment in electric vehicles, an ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025 and cutting carbon emissions per passenger by 50 percent from 2010 levels by 2025. In a first for the New Zealand market, we also led the successful completion of a NZ$50 million sustainability-linked loan for dairy company Synlait Milk Ltd. “Linking our financial arrangements to our ESG performance made perfect sense”, said Nigel Greenwood, Synlait Chief Financial Officer. “It reinforces to our shareholders and stakeholders that we are committed to continuously improving our performance and disclosure, and aligns with our company purpose.” ANZ expects companies will become more receptive to these types of sustainable finance products as climate change and sustainable development move into the fore of their corporate strategies and risk assessment.",

The increase in average interest earning assets reflects growth in Institutional banking portfolios and home loan growth in the New Zealand division. Other operating income decreased $163 million (-3%) largely as the result of net divestment impacts of $198 million, a $120 million decrease in net fee and commission income, and $130 million decrease primarily in other income attributable to realised losses on economic hedges against foreign currency denominated revenue streams (which offset favourable foreign currency translations elsewhere in the Group) and a reduction in income from the lenders mortgage insurance business. This was partially offset by higher Markets other operating income of $154 million, a $79 million increase in share of associate’s profit and a $52 million decrease in customer remediation within other operating income. Operating expenses decreased $330 million (-4%) primarily due to an accelerated software amortisation charge in the prior period of $251 million, lower restructuring expenses of $150 million, a reduction in expenses following the sale of OnePath Life (NZ) and Asia Retail and Wealth businesses of $60 million, lower Royal Commission legal costs of $40 million and lower FTE. This was partially offset by higher customer remediation of $182 million within operating expenses, inflation, the impact of foreign currency translation and regulatory compliance spend in New Zealand.",

    "The financial results of the Wealth Australia businesses being divested and associated Group reclassification and consolidation impacts are treated as discontinued operations from a financial reporting perspective.

Sale to IOOF Holdings Limited (IOOF) On 17 October 2017, the Group announced it had agreed to sell its OnePath P&I and ADGs businesses to IOOF. The aligned dealer groups business consists of ADGs that operate under their own Australian Financial Services licences. The sale of the ADGs completed on 1 October 2018. On 17 October 2019 the Group announced it had agreed a revised sale price for its OnePath P&I business and ADG to IOOF of $850 million, being a $125 million reduction from the original sale price of $975 million announced in October 2017. The new price of $850 million, includes approximately $25 million that ANZ has already received for the sale of ADGs in October 2018. The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements. Subject to APRA approval the Group expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. The impact of the reduction in price has been reflected in the 2019 financial results. Sale to Zurich Financial Services Australia (Zurich) On 12 December 2017, ANZ announced that it had agreed to the sale of its life insurance business to Zurich and regulatory approval was obtained on 10 October 2018. The transaction was completed on 31 May 2019. Included in the ‘Cash loss from discontinued operations’ is: A $23 million loss ($81 million loss after tax) was recognised in the 2019 financial year. This is attributable to sale related adjustments and write-downs, the reversal of the life-to-date cash profit adjustments on the revaluation of policy liabilities sold to Zurich, partially offset by the recycling of gains previously deferred in equity reserves on sale completion. A $632 million loss (pre and post-tax) was recognised on the reclassification of Wealth Australia businesses to held for sale in the 2018 financial year; and Customer remediation which includes provisions for expected refunds to customers and related remediation costs associated with inappropriate advice or services not provided in the pensions and investments and life insurance businesses. An amount of $241 million pre-tax, $207 million post tax was recognised in the 2019 financial year (2018: $181m pre-tax, $127 million post-tax). ANZ’s lenders mortgage insurance, share investing, general insurance distribution and financial planning businesses which were previously part of the continuing operations of Wealth Australia now form part of the Australia Retail and Commercial division (previously named Australia division) and Wealth Australia ceases to exist as a continuing division.",
    "ANZ shares held by the Group in Wealth Australia discontinued operations are deemed to be Treasury shares for accounting purposes. Dividends and realised and unrealised gains and losses from these shares are reversed as they are not permitted to be recognised as income for statutory reporting purposes. In deriving cash profit, these earnings are included to ensure there is no asymmetrical impact on the Group’s profits because the Treasury shares are held to support policy liabilities which are revalued through the Income Statement. With the sale completion of the life insurance business to Zurich, there are no further ANZ shares held by the Group in discontinued operations (2018: 15.5 million shares).",
    "When calculating policy liabilities, the projected future cash flows on insurance contracts are discounted to reflect the present value of the obligation, with the impact of changes in the market discount rate in each period being reflected in the Income Statement. ANZ includes the impact on the re-measurement of the insurance contract attributable to changes in market discount rates as an adjustment to statutory profit to remove the volatility attributable to changes in market interest rates which reverts to zero over the life of the insurance contract. With the sale completion of the life insurance business to Zurich, the 2019 financial year includes the reversal of the life-to-date cash profit adjustments on the revaluation of policy liabilities sold, reducing cash profit by $15 million. 2019 $m 2018 $m Statutory profit/(loss) from discontinued operations (343) (695)",

    "Dear Shareholder, 2019 Remuneration Report – audited This was another challenging year despite the solid gains made in simplifying our business and addressing the difficulties facing our bank and the broader industry. We continued efforts to strengthen our balance sheet and we remain well capitalised, with costs held flat for the year. However, momentum issues within our Retail and Commercial business in Australia, along with challenges in New Zealand (NZ), impacted financial performance. All this has been taken into account when determining remuneration outcomes. Further customer remediation charges of $682 million were recorded this year impacted by historical issues. The Board acknowledges the impact this has on shareholders and this has impacted remuneration outcomes. As you may know, ANZ recorded a ‘first strike’ last year when around a third of shares were voted against our Remuneration Report. While two thirds of shares voted in favour, the Board took this result very seriously and has actively sought feedback from both our institutional and retail shareholders. We have provided additional information in this year’s report to help shareholders better understand the steps we have taken as a Board to respond to the concerns raised. This includes how executive performance has been assessed as well as improvements to accountability and consequence management. ANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT",
    "There has been significant differentiation this year in the remuneration awarded to our executives, reflecting different levels of performance among our most senior leaders. Our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Shayne Elliott, had a solid year where he demonstrated strong leadership in dealing with the challenges facing ANZ and the industry. However, as CEO he is accountable for the overall performance of the Group and as a result was awarded Annual Variable Remuneration (AVR) of 48% of his maximum opportunity. The Variable Remuneration (VR) outcomes for our Disclosed Executives ranged between 0% and 74% of maximum opportunity, demonstrating the ‘at-risk’ nature of their remuneration. As outlined in the Chief Executive’s report, we have also introduced wide-ranging reforms for financial year 2020 as to how we pay our people below our Disclosed Executives, replacing individual bonuses for the vast majority of employees with an incentive based on the overall performance of the Group. This is an industry leading initiative that addresses many of the concerns about ‘bonus culture’ raised in the final report of the Royal Commission. This year, we also strengthened the way we deal with material risks with an enhanced Accountability and Consequence Framework. 151 employees were terminated for breaches of our Code of Conduct with a further 516 employees having their performance and remuneration outcomes impacted.",
    "Your Board is committed to putting remuneration frameworks in place to help foster a culture of trust, integrity and ethical decision making. During 2020, we will undertake a comprehensive review of executive remuneration against Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration recommendations from our prudential regulator as well as the external environment. We will also consult with our stakeholders so that the way we reward our people is aligned with our culture and values as well as customer, shareholder and community standards. On behalf of the Board, I invite you to consider our Remuneration Report which will be presented to shareholders for adoption at the 2019 Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Brisbane.

BOARD RESPONSE TO FEEDBACK PROVIDED IN RELATION TO THE 2018 REMUNERATION REPORT At the AGM in 2018, while two thirds of shares voted were cast in favour of the Remuneration Report, one third were cast against and so ANZ recorded what is termed a ‘first strike’. The Board took this outcome very seriously and sought feedback from both our institutional and retail shareholders. A summary of the key feedback received and changes made this year is provided below.",
    "Questions around whether variable remuneration is sufficiently variable and genuinely at risk. This was a particular focus in 2018 given the impact on ANZ of the Royal Commission and where ANZ recognised substantial customer remediation costs. The Board has focused on ensuring that the 2019 variable remuneration awards appropriately reflect individual and overall performance outcomes. At the start of each year, the Board sets performance objectives for the CEO and each of our Disclosed Executives that are intended to be stretching yet achievable. These contain a blend of both financial (weighted no more than 45%) and non-financial measures designed to focus executives on delivering sustainable long-term performance that supports both good customer and shareholder outcomes aligned to our long-term strategic objectives. The CEO’s performance is assessed against a number of factors including the Group Performance Framework and individual strategic objectives. Although the Board assessed his performance as slightly below expectations, the Board exercised their discretion and applied a reduction to the CEO’s 2019 AVR outcome. This resulted in an award of 48% of maximum opportunity in recognition of the fact that as CEO he is ultimately accountable for overall performance. This year’s VR outcomes for Disclosed Executives ranged from 0% to 74% (2018: 40% to 60%) and averaged 45% (2018: 51%) of maximum opportunity demonstrating the ‘at risk’ nature of variable remuneration. There is significant differentiation in outcomes – with two Disclosed Executives receiving less than 45% of maximum opportunity and one receiving no VR. Include more rationale to help investors understand why the Board believes the remuneration outcomes are appropriate. The variable remuneration structure and outcomes for the CEO and Disclosed Executives are the subject of considerable debate and evaluation by both the HR Committee and the Board. These decisions are not taken lightly or quickly. In response to this feedback, the 2019 Remuneration Report aims to provide further clarity to help shareholders better understand both the process (how performance and remuneration outcomes are determined) and the rationale (why the Board believe this year’s outcomes are appropriate for the CEO and Disclosed Executives). Better explain how consequences are applied for executives for poor conduct/issues ‘on their watch’ that damaged customers and shareholders. In 2019 we implemented a strengthened Accountability and Consequence Framework so that meaningful consequences are applied to executives and employees at all levels, where it is appropriate, for material risk events. The Consequence Review Group (CRG), which is now chaired by the CEO, meets at least four times a year. The CRG reviews material risk events, and considers recommendations from each business regarding accountability and the application of consequences for significant Code of Conduct breaches and material risk and audit events. We have also expanded our disclosures in this report to provide more information on the number of employees where formal consequences have been applied in the 2019 financial year. See section 7. The departure of the Group Executive and CEO, NZ was a clear and public example of the application of meaningful consequences this year. His employment ceased, he was paid no variable remuneration and all unvested deferred remuneration (~$7.4 million) was immediately forfeited. Use ‘face value’ rather than ‘fair value’ when determining the number of deferred share rights awarded to the CRO. We have changed our approach and will award the CRO deferred share rights using the face value of the Company’s shares (rather than the fair value – which is the face value adjusted for the loss of dividends). In order to maintain the same opportunity value, the VR maximum opportunity percentage has been adjusted to 270% of fixed remuneration (previously 255%). This change maintains – it does not increase – the dollar value maximum opportunity, therefore the CRO would not receive greater VR for the same level of performance. Focus on maximum variable remuneration opportunity rather than target opportunity. Variable remuneration outcomes are now primarily expressed as a percentage of maximum opportunity, and the value of performance rights shown using the face value of the rights at full (100%) vesting. This approach more clearly demonstrates the executives’ actual outcomes in comparison to the value they could be awarded if expectations were exceeded at the highest level. There is no change in practice or opportunity. 68 2. WHO IS COVERED BY THIS REPORT 2.1 DISCLOSED EXECUTIVE AND NED CHANGES There were several changes to our Key Management Personnel (KMP) during the 2019 year: Lee Hsien Yang (former NED) retired at the 2018 AGM in December 2018. Lee Hsien Yang (former NED) retired at the 2018 AGM in December 2018. Fred Ohlsson stepped down as Group Executive, Australia in December 2018 to take an extended unpaid career-break, and Mark Hand subsequently acted in the role whilst the Australia Division structure was reviewed. Following a structure review, effective March 2019 Mark Hand and Maile Carnegie share responsibility for the financial performance of our business in Australia. Mark was appointed to the Group Executive, Australia Retail and Commercial Banking role and Maile’s role expanded to Group Executive, Digital and Australia Transformation. David Hisco (former Group Executive and CEO, NZ) departed ANZ in June 2019. Antonia Watson has been subsequently acting in the role. 2.2 KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL (KMP) The KMP whose remuneration is disclosed in this year’s report are: Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) – Current",

    "Received an Annual Variable Remuneration (AVR) award of 48% of maximum opportunity. This reflects performance against his individual objectives and the Group Performance Framework, and the exercise of Board discretion considering his accountability as CEO for the overall performance of the Group. Disclosed Executives – Mark Hand on appointment to the Group Executive, Australia Retail and Commercial Banking role to reflect his expanded responsibilities, and Kevin Corbally (CRO) based on a review of internal and external market relativities, and in recognition of the increase in regulatory activity and complexity of the risk environment. Subject to shareholder approval at the 2019 AGM, he will be awarded Long Term Variable Remuneration (LTVR) of $4.2 million (200% of fixed remuneration) which may vest in 2023 subject to meeting performance hurdles. Variable Remuneration (VR) outcomes for our Disclosed Executives averaged 45% of maximum opportunity, with substantial differentiation at an individual level ranging from 0% to 74% (40% to 60% in 2018). Received total remuneration of $4.09 million for 2019. Upon cessation of employment David Hisco (former Group Executive and CEO, NZ) forfeited all his unvested equity (~$7.4 million). He received his contracted and statutory entitlements to notice and untaken leave, and was not awarded any VR. Performance rights outcomes (CEO and Disclosed Executives) The performance rights awarded to the CEO and Disclosed Executives in November/December 2015 were tested in November 2018 against their three equal Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance hurdles. A total of 21.8% of the award vested and the remaining 78.2% lapsed. See section 5.4.3 for further details. Non-Executive Director (NED) fees There were no increases to NED fees in 2019 (or 2018). Rather, the Board decided to apply a 20% reduction to the Chairman and NED member fees for 2019. 4. OVERVIEW OF ANZ’S REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK 4.1 CHANGES TO THE CEO AND DISCLOSED EXECUTIVES’ REMUNERATION FRAMEWORKS MADE IN 2019 The following changes were made to the CEO and Disclosed Executives’ remuneration frameworks for 2019: Four-year deferral: The deferral and performance period for the performance rights (excluding the CRO who receives deferred share rights) has been extended from three years to four years. This provides an additional year for the performance rights to remain at risk (subject to malus) and for the performance hurdles to be measured. Vesting period: The deferred shares will be delivered over four years with staggered vesting (previously even vesting). See section 6.2. For the CRO: The number of deferred share rights awarded will be determined using the face value (previously fair value), and these share rights will now be subject to a four-year deferral period (previously three years).",
    "interest in carrying out the risk control function across ANZ. As a result of these changes, 68% of variable remuneration (AVR plus LTVR) for the CEO, 53% of VR for Disclosed Executives (other than the CRO), and 41% of VR for the CRO will be deferred for at least four years, noting that this is in excess of the BEAR minimum deferral requirement of 60% for the CEO and 40% for Disclosed Executives. See section 6.2 for more detail. 70 4.2 REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW The structure of our remuneration framework is aligned with our Reward Principles and has been designed to support ANZ’s purpose and strategy.

Performance rights face value at full vesting. 71 5. 2019 OUTCOMES We are mindful of the fact that variable remuneration (more broadly than it pertains to ANZ) has been the subject of much scrutiny with questions raised regarding whether it is truly at risk and sufficiently variable. Variable remuneration at ANZ is truly at risk and can range from zero to maximum opportunity, as evidenced by the outcomes in 2019. The variable remuneration outcomes for both the CEO and Disclosed Executives are the subject of considerable debate and evaluation by the HR Committee and the Board. These decisions are not taken lightly or quickly. The tables in sections 5.1 and 5.2 supplement, and are different to, the Statutory Remuneration table (see section 10.1) which presents the accounting expense for both vested and unvested awards in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards. 5.1 YEAR-ON-YEAR REMUNERATION AWARDED These tables show a year-on-year comparison of remuneration awarded to the CEO and Disclosed Executives for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 performance periods. Remuneration awarded includes any cash payments (e.g. fixed remuneration and cash variable remuneration) and the value of deferred shares and performance rights awarded for the year but which have not yet vested (i.e. the value which has not yet been received during the year). These tables also show the AVR/VR as a % of target and maximum opportunity – this % remains unchanged whether using the threshold or full vesting value of performance rights. Fixed remuneration is largely unchanged year-on-year other than where executives have changed roles. Variable remuneration differs significantly both year-on-year and between different executives, and appropriately reflects the variability in Group and individual performance year-on-year.

Kevin Corbally received a fixed remuneration increase from $900,000 to $1,000,000 on 1 April 2019. On commencing in his role as CRO, Kevin’s fixed remuneration was set below the market median for comparable roles in peer group companies and lower than that of his predecessor. With the significant increase in regulatory activity and complexity of the risk environment, and following a strong performance in his role and reviewing internal relativities, the Board considered the increase appropriate. 2019 CEO individual strategic objectives Lead and role model the culture and accountability required to transform ANZ to deliver better customer outcomes and long-term shareholder value",

    "With regard to AVR, the CEO is assessed 50% on the ANZ Group Performance Framework and 50% on achievement of individual strategic objectives aligned to ANZ’s strategy. Both the Group Performance Framework and individual strategic objectives are agreed by the Board at the start of the financial year and intended to be stretching. Board assessment of performance on individual strategic objectives: Slightly Below Expectations The CEO consistently role modelled the ANZ culture and values in his actions throughout a challenging year for the banking sector. This included the content and manner of his testimony before the Royal Commission and also his handling of the Code of Conduct breach by the former Group Executive and CEO, NZ.",
    "AVR: Financial metrics have a 35% weighting in the Group Performance Framework and therefore notionally have a 17.5% weighting in the CEO’s AVR. However, the CEO’s AVR is not formulaic – outcomes are moderated by the Risk and Reputation element of the Group Performance Framework and the Board’s judgement on the appropriate AVR considering all aspects of performance. LTVR: 100% of the LTVR hurdles are based on TSR (both relative and absolute). ANZ’s view is that TSR is not purely a financial measure as it reflects a range of factors including investors’ judgement about the prospects of a company. Work continued on rebuilding ANZ’s reputation following the Royal Commission last year. However, this was impacted by further remediation charges and challenges in our NZ business. In Australia Retail and Commercial, poor execution of changes to certain processes and procedures including technology transition saw customer loan assessment and approval times extend, leading to a loss of market share. Actions taken throughout mid calendar 2019 have improved these issues. The CEO has continued to build on the key planks of the ANZ strategy – capital efficiency, productivity and simplification – to deliver long-term targeted growth. ANZ delivered a solid financial performance in 2019 – with capital well above APRA’s unquestionably strong Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) requirements, continued productivity savings and the completion of further asset/business disposals. While lending growth in the year was modest, delivery of the core aspects of the strategy positions ANZ well for the future. At the end of the financial year, ANZ’s performance is assessed against the Group Performance Framework, and the CEO’s performance is assessed against his individual strategic objectives, the ANZ values (behaviours), delivery of the BEAR obligations and ANZ’s risk and compliance standards. In conducting the CEO’s performance assessment, the HR Committee seeks input from the Chairman, CRO (on risk management), CFO (on financial performance), Group Executive, Talent and Culture (GE T&C) (on talent and culture matters) and Group General Manager Internal Audit (GGM IA) (on internal audit matters). Around 25% of our people now work in new ways which is driving speed and productivity benefits. These changes are enhancing speed of delivery to customers and producing higher employee engagement results. The CEO has restructured accountability of the Group Executive Committee in 2019 to enhance success and strengthen succession – filling the gaps arising in the Australian business leadership and in dealing with the NZ business leadership issues including the cessation of the former Group Executive and CEO, NZ. 74",

The Board determined that an AVR outcome of 48% of maximum opportunity was appropriate for 2019. The 2019 AVR awarded to the CEO is 48% of maximum opportunity. Shayne Elliott has demonstrated strong leadership both within ANZ and the industry more broadly and delivered solid results for the Group.

    "At the start of each year, the Board sets stretching performance objectives in the form of Divisional Performance Frameworks for each of our Disclosed Executives, in alignment with the Group Performance Framework. Similar to the Group Performance Framework, the Divisional Performance Frameworks include the key elements of Financial and Discipline, Customer, and People and Culture, with Risk and Reputation acting as a modifier. The weighting of measures varies to reflect the responsibilities of each individual’s role. The Financial and Discipline element weightings range from 20% to 45%. 75 At the end of the financial year, the performance of each Disclosed Executive is assessed against their contribution to the Group Performance Framework, their Divisional Performance Framework, ANZ’s values (behaviours), delivery of BEAR obligations and ANZ’s risk and compliance standards. The HR Committee seeks input from the CEO, CRO (on risk management), CFO (on financial performance), GE T&C (on talent and culture matters) and GGM IA (on internal audit matters). Mark Whelan has been awarded 74% of maximum opportunity reflecting the delivery of strong financial results across Institutional, sound risk management, the continued transformation of this business, and the strong focus on culture. Alexis George has a broad role: she is Deputy CEO and also has responsibility for Operations and Services and Wealth Australia. Her VR outcome of 53% of maximum opportunity was impacted for Wealth remediation while also taking into account her strong performance across all aspects of her role. The HR Committee reviews and recommends to the Board for approval the overall performance outcomes for each Disclosed Executive.",
    "At the end of the financial year, the CEO and HR Committee also determine VR recommendations for each Disclosed Executive, which are ultimately approved by the Board. VR should and does vary year- on-year in line with performance – it is not guaranteed and may be adjusted up or down ranging from zero to a maximum opportunity. The average 2019 VR for Disclosed Executives is 45% of maximum opportunity. There is significant differentiation at an individual level ranging between 0% to 74% of maximum. The different VR outcomes reflect the relative performance of the different areas/ individuals, ensuring appropriate alignment between performance and reward. The outcomes also demonstrate the at risk nature of VR, showing that VR is truly variable, and that outcomes do vary significantly across the Disclosed Executives and also from year to year. To illustrate we note that: Mark Hand moved into leading Australia Retail and Commercial part way through the year. He is the right person to run this part of the business going forward and has already led a strong program of work to restore business momentum. However as Group Executive he is held accountable for the weaker performance of this business and has been awarded VR at 28% of maximum opportunity. David Hisco was in his role for eight and a half months of the year, however given the circumstances of his departure, was not awarded any VR (and he also immediately forfeited all unvested remuneration).

Individual variable remuneration outcomes are funded from the ANZIP pool for all eligible employees, including the CEO’s AVR and Disclosed Executives’ VR. At the end of each financial year, the HR Committee makes a recommendation to the Board for their approval on the size of the ANZIP variable remuneration pool for that year, including its allocation to each Division. The Board exercise their judgement to determine the appropriate pool size – it is not a formulaic outcome.",
    "When determining the size of the 2019 variable remuneration pool the HR Committee and Board considered a range of inputs. These included: our financial performance – a range of metrics are used including cash profit, economic profit and return on risk weighted assets. Economic profit, which is a risk adjusted measure and a strong indicator of shareholder value, is the primary financial driver but is balanced against other financial metrics and qualitative factors. – Solid financial performance with cash profit up 6%, while on a continuing operations basis cash profit is flat and economic profit down 1%. our performance against the ANZ Group Performance Framework. – Assessed overall as being below expectations in 2019 (as detailed in section 5.5.3). other relevant factors such as the overall operating environment, market competitive remuneration positioning, affordability, the quality of our results and prior year pools. ANZ substantially reduced the size of the ANZIP pool in 2018 decreasing it by around 23% compared to the prior financial year. In 2019, having considered all of the above inputs, the Board determined that a year-on-year increase of around 9% was appropriate, and recognising that the pool remains 15% below that of 2017. 77 5.5.2 ANZ Group Performance Framework The ANZ Group Performance Framework is approved by the Board at the start of each year and is designed around the following three key inputs: 1",

    "As managing risk appropriately is fundamental to the way ANZ operates, Risk and Reputation forms an integral part of the assessment, directly impacting the overall Group Performance Framework outcome (a modifier ranging from 0% to 110% of the Group Performance Assessment). Overall, ANZ’s performance was below expectations when considering the environment and the objectives we set ourselves. While we largely achieved the targets we set, more broadly we recognise we have much to do to regain community trust. The below table outlines ANZ’s focus areas in 2019 (aligned to the three key inputs), and provides a summary of performance outcomes for each of the key performance categories to inform the overall assessment for 2019. Performance against expectations is evaluated using a range of objective indicators and subjective considerations including management input on work undertaken, evidence of outcomes realised and lessons learned, and with consideration given to the operating, regulatory and competitive environment. 78 RISK & REPUTATION (MODIFIER 0% TO 110%) Risk & Reputation (modifier 0% to 110%) ANZ continues to operate in a dynamic and a challenging external and regulatory environment placing significant demands on the Risk and Compliance function. There were no material breaches of our Group Risk Appetite Statement, and the number of adverse audits fell by a third with management demonstrating accountability for fixing issues in a timely and sustainable manner. Strong leadership has been paramount, coupled with a focus on seeking to regain the trust of the community through our commitment to fair and responsible banking. A combination of management actions over several years together with the current relatively benign credit environment, delivered one of the lowest loss rates on record. While there were many positives from a risk perspective, our overall risk assessment was brought back to below expectations when balanced against some non-financial risk shortcomings from a regulatory, customer and community perspective and the work that still needs to be done to regain community trust. 2019 focus areas",

The Group uses cash profit as a measure of performance for the Group’s ongoing business activities, as this provides a basis to assess Group and Divisional performance against earlier periods and against peer institutions. We calculate cash profit by adjusting statutory profit for non-core items. Although cash profit is not audited, the external auditor has informed the Audit Committee that recurring adjustments have been determined on a consistent basis across each period presented. The table below provides ANZ’s financial performance, including cash profit, over the last five years. 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Statutory profit ($m) 7,493 5,709 6,406 6,400 5,953 Cash profit ($m, unaudited) 7,216 5,889 6,938 5,805 6,161 Cash profit – Continuing operations ($m, unaudited)1 7,216 5,889 6,809 6,487 6,470 Cash ROE (%) – Continuing operations (unaudited)1 14.0 10.3 11.7 11.0 10.9 Cash EPS – Continuing operations (unaudited)1 260.3 202.6 232.7 223.4 227.6 Share price at 30 September ($) (On 1 October 2014, opening share price was $30.74) 27.08 27.63 29.60 28.18 28.52 Total dividend (cents per share) 181 160 160 160 160 Total shareholder return (12 month %) (7.5) 9.2 13.1 0.6 9.2 1.

The outcomes for performance rights granted in November/December 2015 and tested in November 2018 are detailed in section 5.4.3. 6. EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION STRUCTURE AND DELIVERY There are two core components of remuneration at ANZ – fixed remuneration and at risk variable remuneration. – tie the full VR award to the performance of ANZ; and – defer VR over the short, medium and longer term. In structuring remuneration, the Board aims to find the right balance between fixed and variable remuneration (at risk), the way it is delivered (cash versus deferred remuneration) and appropriate time frames (the short, medium and long-term). Variable remuneration seeks to differentiate for performance and is designed to focus our CEO and Disclosed Executives on stretching performance objectives supporting our business strategy, and encourage the delivery of long-term stakeholder value. The way variable remuneration operates differs somewhat between the CEO and Disclosed Executives. Namely: The CEO’s variable remuneration is comprised of AVR and LTVR (subject to shareholder approval), which provides consistency with external market practice, and LTVR reinforces his focus on achieving longer term strategic objectives and long-term stakeholder value creation. Disclosed Executives are subject to one combined VR plan which enables us to: – provide the appropriate mix of short and long-term rewards (including performance hurdles) to drive performance, and attract and retain talent; By deferring a significant portion of variable remuneration (79% of maximum opportunity for the CEO, 75% for Disclosed Executives, 67% for the CRO and 40% for the Acting Group Executive and CEO, NZ), we seek to ensure alignment with shareholder interests to deliver on ANZ’s strategic objectives and ensure a focus on long-term value creation. Deferred variable remuneration has significant retention elements, and most importantly, can be adjusted downwards, including to zero, allowing the Board to hold executives accountable, individually or collectively, for the longer term impacts of their decisions and actions.",

For the time spent in this acting role, her fixed remuneration has been set at NZ$800,000 per annum (from 17 June 2019) and her VR maximum opportunity has been increased to 300% of fixed remuneration (her remuneration mix is therefore 25% fixed remuneration and 75% VR maximum opportunity).

By deferring part of an executives’ remuneration over time (and it remaining subject to malus), we enable a substantial amount of their remuneration to be directly linked to delivering long-term shareholder value. We grant deferred shares in respect of performance for the 1 October to 30 September financial year in late November each year. We calculate the number of deferred shares to be granted based on the VWAP of the shares traded on the ASX in the week leading up to and including the date of grant. For disclosure and expensing purposes, we use the one day VWAP to determine the fair value. In some cases (generally due to regulatory or tax reasons), we may grant deferred share rights to executives instead of deferred shares. Each deferred share right entitles the holder to one ordinary share. 6.2.3a Performance rights – CEO (LTVR) and Disclosed Executives (VR) excluding the CRO and Acting Group Executive and CEO, NZ A performance right is a right to acquire one ordinary ANZ share at nil cost – as long as time and performance hurdles are met. The future value of performance rights may range from zero to an indeterminate value. The value depends on our performance against the hurdles and on the share price at the time of exercise. 3 2 0 2 v o N 85 The performance rights have a four-year performance period. For the 2019 grant, the performance period is from 22 November 2019 to 21 November 2023. A four-year performance period provides sufficient time for longer term performance to be reflected. More detail relating to the 2019 performance rights is provided below.",
    "The performance rights have TSR performance hurdles reflecting the importance of focusing on achieving longer term strategic objectives and aligning executives’ and shareholders’ interests. We will apply two TSR performance hurdles for the 2019 grants of performance rights: 75% will be measured against a relative TSR hurdle, tranche 1. 25% will be measured against an absolute TSR hurdle, tranche 2. TSR represents the change in value of a share plus the value of reinvested dividends paid. We regard it as the most appropriate long-term measure – it focuses on the delivery of shareholder value and is a well understood and tested mechanism to measure performance. The combination of relative and absolute TSR hurdles provides balance to the plan by: Relative: rewarding executives for performance that exceeds that of comparator companies; and Absolute: ensuring there is a continued focus on providing positive growth – even when the market is declining. The two hurdles measure separate aspects of performance: the relative TSR hurdle measures our TSR compared to that of the Select Financial Services comparator group, made up of core local and global competitors. This comparator group is chosen to broadly reflect the geographies and business segments in which ANZ competes for revenue; and the absolute Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) TSR hurdle provides executives with a more direct line of sight to the level of shareholder return to be achieved. It also provides a tighter correlation between the executives’ rewards and the shareholders’ financial outcomes. We will measure ANZ’s TSR against each hurdle at the end of the four-year performance period to determine whether each tranche of performance rights become exercisable. We measure each tranche independently from the other – that is: one tranche may vest fully or partially but the other tranche may not vest. Relative TSR hurdle for the 2019 grant The relative TSR hurdle is an external hurdle that measures our TSR against that of the Select Financial Services comparator group over four years. The Select Financial Services comparator group (unchanged from prior years) is made up of: Bank of Queensland Limited; Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited; Commonwealth Bank of Australia Limited; DBS Bank Limited; Macquarie Group Limited; National Australia Bank Limited; Standard Chartered PLC; Suncorp Group Limited; and Westpac Banking Corporation. If our TSR when compared to the TSR of the comparator group is less than the 50th percentile reaches at least the 50th percentile, but is less than the 75th percentile",
    "is nil is 50% plus 2% for every one percentile increase above the 50th percentile reaches or exceeds the 75th percentile is 100% Absolute TSR hurdle for the 2019 grant The Absolute CAGR TSR hurdle is an internal hurdle as to whether ANZ achieves or exceeds a threshold level of growth the Board sets at the start of the performance period. The Board reviews and approves the absolute TSR targets each year for that year’s award. When reviewing the targets, the Board references ANZ’s assessed Cost of Capital. The Cost of Capital is determined using methodologies including the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The primary driver of the reduction in the Cost of Capital used in setting this year’s target is the reduction in the risk free rate (government bond yield) that has occurred in Australia and other developed economies in the last 12 months.",

    "When calculating performance against TSR, we: • reduce the impact of share price volatility – by using an averaging calculation over a 90-day period for start and end values; ensure an independent measurement – by engaging the services of an external organisation, Mercer Consulting (Australia) Pty Ltd, to calculate ANZ’s performance against the TSR hurdles; and test the performance against the relevant hurdle once only at the end of the four-year performance period – the rights lapse if the performance hurdle is not met – there is no retesting.",
    "The number of performance rights we grant is calculated using a face value basis – i.e. the full share price. Face value at full vesting is split into two tranches. Each tranche value is then divided by the market price (five trading day VWAP of ANZ shares at the start of the performance period) to determine the number of performance rights we award in each tranche. Performance rights are allocated in November for Disclosed Executives and December for the CEO (subject to shareholder approval).",
    "ANZ engages PricewaterhouseCoopers to independently determine the fair value of performance rights, which is only used for expensing purposes. They consider factors including: the performance conditions, share price volatility, life of the instrument, dividend yield, and share price at grant date. 6.2.3b Deferred share rights – CRO (VR) The CRO receives deferred share rights instead of performance rights to preserve the independence of the role and to minimise any conflicts of interest in carrying out the risk control function across the organisation. The CRO’s deferred share rights are subject to a time-based vesting hurdle of four years. The value the Board uses to determine the number of deferred share rights to be allocated to the CRO is the face value of the Company’s shares traded on the ASX at the time of grant (five trading day VWAP). 6.3 MALUS (DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT OF PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED REMUNERATION) – BOARD DISCRETION All deferred remuneration we award to an employee is subject to ANZ’s on-going and absolute discretion to adjust this downward (malus) (including to zero) at any time. ANZ may exercise this discretion, for example, where: there is a need to protect the financial soundness of ANZ or to meet regulatory requirements or there has been a material failure of risk management or controls within ANZ; the employee has acted fraudulently or dishonestly, failed to act with due care, skill and diligence, or failed to comply with ANZ policies (including the Code of Conduct), processes or directions; the employee is responsible or accountable, directly or indirectly, by virtue of their role or seniority for an occurrence/event which has had an adverse impact on ANZ; there has been misconduct and the employee was involved directly or indirectly, failed to take adequate steps, could be considered responsible due to their seniority, or the decision to award or grant the deferred remuneration was made on the basis of misinformation. Further, where the CEO and/or Disclosed Executives of ANZ have failed to comply with their accountability obligations under the BEAR, their deferred remuneration will be reduced by an amount that is proportionate to the failure, as required by the BEAR. An employee’s deferred remuneration is also subject to ANZ’s on-going and absolute discretion to further defer the vesting. Where ANZ exercises this discretion, the vesting date is postponed and will not vest unless and until ANZ determines it should vest.",
    "87 7. ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONSEQUENCE FRAMEWORK This year we further strengthened the way we deal with material risk events through an enhanced Accountability and Consequence Framework. The Consequence Review Group (CRG) is chaired by the CEO and members include the CRO, CFO, GE T&C and GGM IA. The CRG oversees the implementation and ongoing effectiveness of ANZ’s Accountability and Consequence Framework, being cognisant of its impact on the culture of ANZ. The CRG reviews material events, accountability and the application of suitable consequences (the HR Committee and Board determine accountability and consequences for the CEO and Disclosed Executives). Appropriate consequences are determined in light of the severity of the issue and may include, for example, one or more of the following: coaching, counselling, formal warnings, impacts to performance and remuneration outcomes, impacts on promotion, application of malus and ultimately termination of employment for the most serious issues. Our ongoing focus on accountability, consequences and driving a strong risk culture supports our customer commitment that when things go wrong, we fix them quickly and consistently hold executives, current (and former where we can), to account where appropriate. In 2019 across the Group, 151 employees were terminated for breaches of our Code of Conduct. A further 516 employees received a formal disciplinary outcome, with managers required to apply impacts to their performance and remuneration outcomes as part of the annual review process. ANZ announced in June 2019 that David Hisco would depart ANZ. The Board noted their concerns regarding the characterisation of certain transactions following an internal review of personal expenses. This was a clear and public example of the application of meaningful consequences. David’s employment was ceased, he was awarded no variable remuneration for 2019 and he immediately forfeited all unvested deferred remuneration which totalled around $7.4 million. This provided a clear message both internally and externally of the importance of doing the right thing and that this is expected of all our people regardless of seniority. No malus was applied to the previously deferred remuneration of the CEO and Disclosed Executives during 2019. As disclosed in 2018 malus (downward adjustment) was applied to the unvested equity held by former Disclosed Executives. We also seek to support a strong ‘speak up’ culture and ensure managers recognise exemplary risk and audit behaviours. The focus on speak up is being supported through our New Ways of Leading (NWOL) that are aligned with our purpose and values. NWOL focuses on five behaviours relevant for all employees and imperative for people leaders: be curious, create shared clarity, empower people, connect with empathy and grow people selflessly. We are incorporating culture into leader-led team activities to facilitate open, purposeful conversations about our culture and practices and create a psychologically safe environment for employees to speak up. We continue to raise employee awareness of, and promote the various ways that employees can speak up including through initiatives such as the Whistleblower Awareness Week. At the senior leadership level, 30 current or former senior leaders (senior executives, executives and senior managers) had consequences applied in 2019 for Code of Conduct breaches or findings of accountability for a material event, or otherwise left the bank after an investigation had been initiated. The 30 employees represent ~1% of the senior leader population. The consequences applied included warnings, impacts to performance and/or remuneration outcomes and cessation of employment. SENIOR LEADER CONSEQUENCES IN 20191",
    "Where employees role model the ANZ values and exemplary risk management we also seek to recognise and reward this, including through our annual Performance and Remuneration Review. 1. Individuals are included under all categories that are relevant meaning one individual may be reflected in multiple categories. 8. NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR (NED) REMUNERATION 8.1 REMUNERATION STRUCTURE The Board reviewed NED fees for 2019 and determined once again not to increase their fees (which remain unchanged from 2016). As disclosed in last year’s Remuneration Report, the NEDs who served on the Board in 2018 agreed to a 20% reduction of their Board fee for 2019 (20% reduction to the Chairman fee from $825,000 to $660,000, and 20% reduction to the NED member fee from $240,000 to $192,000) as a consequence for the shared accountability for the failures highlighted by the Royal Commission. NEDs receive a base fee for being a Director of the Board, and additional fees for either chairing, or being a member of a Board Committee. The Chairman of the Board does not receive additional fees for serving on a Board Committee. In setting Board and Committee fees, the Board considers: general industry practice, corporate governance principles, the responsibilities and risks attached to the NED role, the time commitment expected of NEDs on Group and Company matters, and fees paid to NEDs of comparable companies. ANZ compares NED fees to a comparator group of Australian listed companies with a similar market capitalisation, with particular focus on the major financial services institutions. This is considered an appropriate group, given similarity in size, nature of work and time commitment by NEDs. 88 23 12 7 To maintain NED independence and impartiality: NED fees are not linked to the performance of the Group; and NEDs are not eligible to participate in any of the Group’s variable remuneration arrangements. The current aggregate fee pool for NEDs of $4 million was approved by shareholders at the 2012 AGM. The annual total of NEDs’ fees, including superannuation contributions, is within this agreed limit. This table shows the NED fee policy structure for 2019: Board1, 2 Board fee after reduction1, 2",

REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE 9.1 THE HUMAN RESOURCES (HR) COMMITTEE 9.1.2 Link between remuneration and risk 9.1.1 Role of the HR Committee The HR Committee supports the Board on remuneration and other HR matters. It reviews the remuneration policies and practices of the Group, and monitors market practice and regulatory and compliance requirements in Australia and overseas. To further reflect the importance of the link between remuneration and risk: the Board had two NEDs (in addition to the Chairman) in 2019 who served on both the HR Committee and the Risk Committee; and The HR Committee has a strong focus on the relationship between business performance, risk management and remuneration, aligned with our business strategy. The chairs of the Risk and Audit Committees are members of the HR Committee and often the full Board is in attendance for specific HR Committee meetings. During the year the HR Committee met on six occasions and reviewed and approved, or made recommendations to the Board on matters including: the HR Committee has free and unfettered access to risk and financial control personnel (the CRO and CFO attend HR Committee meetings for specific agenda items). 9.1.3 External advisors provided information but not recommendations The HR Committee can engage independent external advisors as needed. remuneration for the CEO and other key executives (broader than those disclosed in the Remuneration Report) covered by the ANZBGL Remuneration Policy and ANZ NZ Remuneration Policy, and fees for the NEDs; the design of significant variable remuneration plans – for example: the ANZIP – and the progress of the implementation of changes in Divisional Business Unit Incentive Plans in response to the industry-wide Retail Remuneration Review by Stephen Sedgwick AO; Throughout the year, the HR Committee and management received information from the following external providers: Aon, Ashurst, EY, Mercer Consulting (Australia) Pty Ltd, Morrow Sodali and PricewaterhouseCoopers. This information related to market data, market practices, legislative requirements and the interpretation of governance and regulatory requirements. During the year, ANZ did not receive any remuneration recommendations from external consultants about the remuneration of KMP. the design and implementation of Reimagining Reward – an organisational-wide change to our approach to remuneration, performance management and recognition, which supports positive risk culture and includes the redesign of how we manage and reward our people to better focus on the interests of our customers, and the long-term health of our bank and team, rather than individual outcomes; ANZ employs in-house remuneration professionals who provide recommendations to the HR Committee and the Board. The Board made its decisions independently, using the information provided and with careful regard to ANZ’s strategic objectives, purpose and values, risk appetite and the ANZBGL Remuneration Policy and Principles. 9.2 INTERNAL GOVERNANCE the ANZ Group Performance Framework (annual objectives setting and assessment) and annual variable remuneration spend; performance and reward outcomes for key senior executives, including the consideration of malus/downward adjustment; 9.2.1 Hedging prohibition All deferred equity must remain at risk until it has fully vested. Accordingly, executives and their associated persons must not enter into any schemes that specifically protect the unvested value of equity allocated. If they do so, then they forfeit the relevant equity. key senior executive appointments and terminations; 9.2.2 CEO and Disclosed Executives’ shareholding guidelines the effectiveness of the ANZBGL Remuneration Policy and changes to the policy to incorporate the BEAR requirements; We expect the CEO and each Disclosed Executive to, over a five-year period: succession plans for key senior executives; accumulate ANZ shares to the value of 200% of their fixed culture and governance including endorsing a new culture accountability model and the strengthened Accountability and Consequence Framework; and culture and governance including endorsing a new culture accountability model and the strengthened Accountability and Consequence Framework; and maintain this shareholding level while they are an executive of ANZ. diversity, inclusion, and employee engagement.

For this purpose, shareholdings include all vested and unvested equity that is not subject to performance hurdles. Based on equity holdings as at 30 September 2019, the CEO and all Disclosed Executives: who have been with us for at least five years, meet this requirement; and who have been with us for less than five years, are on track to meet it. 90 9.2.3 CEO and Disclosed Executives’ contract terms and equity treatment The details of the contract terms and also the equity treatment on termination (in accordance with the Conditions of Grant) relating to the CEO and Disclosed Executives are below.

Non monetary benefits generally consist of company-funded benefits (and the associated Fringe Benefits Tax) such as car parking, taxation services and costs met by the Company in relation to relocation and cessation. The total cash incentive relates to the cash component only. The relevant amortisation of the AVR/VR deferred components is included in share-based payments and has been amortised over the vesting period. The total AVR/VR was approved by the Board on 25 October 2019. 100% of the cash component of the AVR/VR awarded for the 2018 and 2019 years vested to the executive in the applicable financial year. Other cash and other equity allocations relate to employment arrangements such as compensation for bonus opportunity foregone and deferred remuneration forfeited, retention awards, and shares received in relation to the Employee Share Offer. For further details, see the individual footnotes for each relevant executive. For all Australian based executives, the 2018 and 2019 superannuation contributions reflect the Superannuation Guarantee Contribution based on the Maximum Contribution Base. From 31 August 2018, D Hisco commenced superannuation contributions to KiwiSaver where ANZ provides an employer contribution matching member contributions up to 4% of total gross pay (less employer superannuation contribution tax). A Watson also participates in KiwiSaver. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. Accrual relates to Retirement Allowance. As a result of being employed with ANZ before November 1992, M Hand is, and D Hisco was eligible to receive a Retirement Allowance on retirement, retrenchment, death, or resignation for illness, incapacity or domestic reasons. The Retirement Allowance is calculated as three months of preserved notional salary (which is 65% of fixed remuneration) plus an additional 3% of notional salary for each year of full-time service above 10 years less the total accrual value of long service leave (including taken and untaken). As required by AASB 2 Share-based payments, the amortisation value includes a proportion of the fair value (taking into account market-related vesting conditions) of all equity that had not yet fully vested as at the commencement of the financial year. The fair value is determined at grant date and is allocated on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period. The amount included as remuneration neither relates to, nor indicates, the benefit (if any) that the executive may ultimately realise if the equity becomes exercisable. Termination benefits reflect payment for accrued annual leave, long service leave and pay in lieu of notice in accordance with contract, payable on cessation. 2018 other equity allocations for M Carnegie relate to previously disclosed compensation for bonus opportunity foregone and deferred remuneration forfeited. K Corbally commenced in a Disclosed Executive role on 19 March 2018. So his 2018 remuneration reflects a partial service year. K Corbally's fixed remuneration was adjusted on 1 April 2019 based on a review of internal and external market relativities, and in recognition of the increase in regulatory activity and the broader risk environment. In relation to K Corbally's role before his appointment to the Group Executive Committee, in August 2016 the Board approved an equity retention award of $600,000 vesting in August 2019. Other equity allocations relate to this award. 92 LONG-TERM",

    "2,195,484 A George's fixed remuneration was adjusted in May 2018 when she commenced in the expanded role of Deputy CEO and Group Executive, Wealth Australia. As disclosed in 2017, in relation to A George's role before her appointment to the Group Executive Committee, in July 2016 the Board approved a cash retention award of $500,000 with partial vesting in June 2017 ($250,000) and December 2017 ($250,000). M Hand commenced in a Disclosed Executive role on 29 December 2018. So his 2019 remuneration reflects a partial service year. M Hand's fixed remuneration was adjusted on 1 March 2019 on appointment to the Group Executive, Australia Retail and Commercial Banking role. Other cash and other equity allocations for M Jablko relate to previously disclosed compensation for bonus opportunity foregone and deferred remuneration forfeited. A Watson commenced in a Disclosed Executive role on 17 June 2019. So her 2019 remuneration reflects a partial service year. A Watson's fixed remuneration is paid in NZD and converted to AUD. In 2016 A Watson, D Hisco and F Ohlsson, and in 2018 and 2019 A Watson and D Hisco, were eligible to receive shares under the Employee Share Offer. That offer provides a grant of ANZ shares in each financial year to eligible employees subject to Board approval. See Note 31 Employee Share and Option Plans for further details on the Employee Share Offer. D Hisco ceased employment 14 June 2019. Remuneration reflects up to his date of cessation (noting his annual fixed remuneration for 2019 remained unchanged at NZD 1.274 million). Share-based payments include the expensing treatment on cessation for unvested deferred remuneration (including reversals for forfeiture on cessation). D Hisco's fixed remuneration was paid in NZD and converted to AUD. Termination benefits reflect payment for accrued annual leave, long service leave and pay in lieu of notice in accordance with his contract, payable on cessation. Following an internal review it was determined that certain expense and allowances previously provided to D Hisco and categorised as business related would more appropriately be characterised as non-business related and included as non monetary benefits in the Remuneration Report. The 2018 comparative balances have been restated to increase non monetary benefits by $8,360 plus related Fringe Benefit Tax of $4,117. Similar items existed in the period between 2010-2017 which would have increased the non monetary benefits disclosed for D Hisco on average each year by approximately $44,580 plus related Fringe Benefit Tax of $21,956. 11. 16. 12. 13. 14. 17. F Ohlsson concluded in his role 28 December 2018. Remuneration reflects up to his date of conclusion in role (noting his annual fixed remuneration for 2019 remained unchanged at $1 million). 15. 93 10.2 EQUITY HOLDINGS For the equity granted to the CEO and Disclosed Executives in November/December 2018, all deferred shares were purchased on the market. For deferred share rights and performance rights, we will determine our approach to satisfying awards closer to the time of vesting. 10.2.1 CEO and Disclosed Executives equity granted, vested, exercised/sold and lapsed/forfeited The table below sets out details of deferred shares and rights that we granted to the CEO and Disclosed Executives: during the 2019 year; or in prior years and that then vested, were exercised/sold or which lapsed/were forfeited during the 2019 year.",

The information below forms part of this Directors’ Report: Principal activities on page 8 Operating and financial review on pages 52 to 64 Dividends on page 63 Information on the Directors, Company Secretaries and Directors’ meetings on pages 32 to 42 Remuneration report on pages 66 to 98 Significant changes in state of affairs There has been no significant changes in the Group’s state of affairs. Events since the end of the financial year On 17 October the Group announced it had agreed a revised price for the sale of its OnePath P&I business and ADGs to IOOF of $850 million, being a $125 million reduction from the original sale price of $975 million announced in October 2017. The new price of $850 million includes approximately $25 million that ANZ has already received for the sale of ADGs in October 2018. The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements. Subject to APRA approval, the Group expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. The impact of the reduction in price has been reflected in the 2019 financial results. Other than the matter above, there have been no significant events from 30 September 2019 to the date of signing this report. Political donations Our policy is that we will make an annual donation to the two major federal parties to support the democratic process in Australia. In the 2019 calendar year, we donated $100,000 to the Liberal Party of Australia and $100,000 to the Australian Labor Party. Environmental regulation ANZ recognises the expectations of its stakeholders – customers, shareholders, staff and the community – to operate in a way that mitigates its environmental impact. In Australia, ANZ meets the requirements of the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (Cth), which imposes reporting obligations where energy production, usage or greenhouse gas emissions trigger specified thresholds. ANZ holds a licence under the Water Act 1989 (Vic), allowing it to extract water from the Yarra River for thermal regulation of its Melbourne head office building. The licence specifies daily and annual limits for the extraction of water from the Yarra River with which ANZ fully complies. The extraction of river water reduces reliance on the high quality potable water supply and is one of several environmental initiatives that ANZ has introduced at its Melbourne head office building. The Group does not believe that its operations are subject to any particular and significant environmental regulation under a law of the Commonwealth of Australia or of an Australian State or Territory. It may become subject to environmental regulation as a result of its lending activities in the ordinary course of business and has developed policies to identify and manage such environmental matters. Having made due enquiry, and to the best of ANZ’s knowledge, no entity of the Group has incurred any material environmental liability during the year. Further details of ANZ’s environmental performance, including progress against its targets and details of its emissions profile, are available on anz.com>About us>Corporate Sustainability. Corporate Governance Statement ANZ is committed to maintaining a high standard in its governance framework. ANZ confirms it has followed the ASX Corporate Governance Council’s Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (3rd edition) during the 2019 financial year. ANZ’s Corporate Governance Statement, together with the ASX Appendix 4G which relates to the Corporate Governance Statement, can be viewed at anz.com/corporategovernance and has been lodged with the ASX. Pillar 3 information ANZ provides information required by APS 330: Public Disclosure in the Regulatory Disclosures section at www.anz.com/shareholder/ centre/reporting/regulatory-disclosure/ Non-audit services The Group’s Stakeholder Engagement Model for Relationship with the External Auditor (the Policy), which incorporates requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and industry best practice, prevents the external auditor from providing services that are perceived to be in conflict with the role of the external auditor or breach independence requirements. This includes consulting advice and sub-contracting of operational activities normally undertaken by management, and engagements where the external auditor may ultimately be required to express an opinion on its own work. Specifically the Policy: limits the scope of non-audit services that may be provided; requires that audit, audit-related and permitted non-audit services be considered in light of independence requirements and for any potential conflicts of interest before they are approved by the Audit Committee, or approved by the Chair of the Audit Committee (or delegate) and notified to the Audit Committee; and requires pre-approval before the external auditor can commence any engagement for the Group. Further details about the Policy can be found in the Corporate Governance Statement. The external auditor has confirmed to the Audit Committee that it has: implemented procedures to ensure it complies with independence rules in applicable jurisdictions; and complied with applicable policies and regulations in those jurisdictions regarding the provision of non-audit services, and the Policy. The Audit Committee has reviewed the non-audit services provided by the external auditor during the 2019 financial year, and has confirmed that the provision of these services is consistent with the Policy, compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 and did not compromise the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001. This has been formally advised by the Audit Committee to the Board of Directors. 99 Directors’ Report (continued) The categories of non-audit services supplied to the Group during the year ended 30 September 2019 by the external auditor, KPMG, or by another person or firm on KPMG’s behalf, and the amounts paid or payable (including GST) by the Group are as follows: Amount paid/payable $’000 During the financial year, the Company has paid premiums for insurance for the benefit of the Directors and employees of the Company and related bodies corporate of the Company. In accordance with common commercial practice, the insurance prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liability insured against and the amount of the premium. Non-audit services",

    "1. ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS These are the financial statements for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (the Company) and its controlled entities (together, ‘the Group’ or ‘ANZ’) for the year ended 30 September 2019. The Company is incorporated and domiciled in Australia. The address of the Company’s registered office and its principal place of business is ANZ Centre, 833 Collins Street, Docklands, Victoria, Australia 3008. On 30 October 2019, the Directors resolved to authorise the issue of these financial statements. Information in the financial statements is included only to the extent we consider it material and relevant to the understanding of the financial statements. A disclosure is considered material and relevant if, for example: the amount is significant in size (quantitative factor); the information is significant by nature (qualitative factor); the user cannot understand the Group’s results without the specific disclosure (qualitative factor); the information is critical to a user’s understanding of the impact of significant changes in the Group’s business during the period - for example, business acquisitions or disposals (qualitative factor); the information relates to an aspect of the Group’s operations that is important to its future performance (qualitative factor); and the information is required under legislative requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, the Banking Act 1959 (Cth) or by the Group’s principal regulators, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).

We present the financial statements of the Group in Australian dollars, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. We have rounded values to the nearest million dollars ($m), unless otherwise stated, as allowed under the ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors Report) Instrument 2016/191. We measure the financial statements of each entity in the Group using the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates (the functional currency).",
    "We have prepared the financial information in accordance with the historical cost basis - except the following assets and liabilities which we have stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments and in the case of fair value hedging, a fair value adjustment is made on the underlying hedged exposure; financial instruments held for trading; financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss; available-for-sale financial assets (prior to 1 October 2018); financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (applicable from 1 October 2018); and certain other assets and liabilities held for sale where the fair value less costs of disposal is less than their carrying value (excludes assets and liabilities held for sale which are exempt from this requirement). In accordance with AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts (AASB 1038) we have measured life insurance liabilities using the Margin on Services (MoS) model. In accordance with AASB 119 Employee Benefits (AASB 119) we have measured defined benefit obligations using the Projected Unit Credit Method.",

    "The consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries. An entity, including a structured entity, is considered a subsidiary of the Group when we determine that the Company has control over the entity. Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. We assess power by examining existing rights that give the Group the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity.

    "AASB 9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (AASB 9) The Group has applied AASB 9 effective from 1 October 2018 (with the exception of the ‘own credit’ requirements relating to financial liabilities designated as measured at fair value, which were early adopted by the Group effective from 1 October 2013). In addition, the Group chose to early adopt AASB 2017-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (AASB 2017-6) effective from 1 October 2018. AASB 9 provides an accounting policy choice, which the Group has taken in current period, to continue to apply the AASB 139 hedge accounting requirements until the International Accounting Standards Board’s ongoing project on macro hedge accounting is completed. AASB 9 and AASB 2017-6 stipulate new requirements for the impairment of financial assets, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and general hedge accounting. Details of the key requirements are outlined within the Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities sections on pages 125 and 144 respectively, and a reconciliation of the transitional impact of adopting the standard at 1 October 2018 is set out in Note 35. AASB 15 REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (AASB 15) The Group adopted AASB 15 from 1 October 2018 which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements. The standard requires identification of distinct performance obligations within a contract, and allocation of the transaction price of the contract to those performance obligations. Revenue is then recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied. The standard also provides guidance on whether an entity is acting as a principal or an agent which impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis. In accordance with the transitional provisions of AASB 15, the Group has adopted the full retrospective transition approach. Under this approach, the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard has been recognised as an adjustment to opening retained earnings as at 1 October 2017 and comparative information for the 2018 reporting period has been restated. The adoption of AASB 15 resulted in the following changes in accounting policy: Recognition of trail commission revenue: trail commission revenue previously recognised over time is now recognised at the time the Group initially distributes the underlying product to the customer where it is highly probable the revenue will not need to be reversed in future periods. This policy change resulted in an increase to the opening balances of Other assets of $32 million, Deferred tax liabilities of $10 million and Retained earnings of $22 million as at 1 October 2017 to recognise revenue that qualifies for upfront recognition under AASB 15 but was not previously recognised under AASB 118 Revenue (AASB 118). The change did not impact net profit or earnings per share in the comparative periods. Presentation: Certain credit card loyalty costs and other costs will be presented as operating expenses where the Group has assessed that it is acting as principal (rather than an agent). Previously these costs were presented as a reduction of other operating income. In addition, certain incentives received from card scheme providers related to card marketing activities will be presented as operating income where the Group has assessed that it is acting as principal (rather than an agent). Previously these incentives were presented as a reduction of operating expenses. The presentation of these costs under AASB 15 increased other operating income and operating expenses by $153 million in 2018. The changes did not impact net profit or earnings per share in the comparative periods. A minor balance sheet reclassification associated with credit card loyalty programs is set out in Note 35. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT EARLY ADOPTED A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been published but are not mandatory for the financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2019, and have not been applied by the Group in preparing these financial statements. Further details of these are set out below.",
    "AASB 9 introduces new hedge accounting requirements which more closely align accounting with risk management activities undertaken when hedging financial and non-financial risks. AASB 9 provides the Group with an accounting policy choice to continue to apply the AASB 139 hedge accounting requirements until the International Accounting Standards Board’s ongoing project on macro hedge accounting is completed. The Group currently applies the hedge accounting requirements of AASB 139. AASB 16 LEASES (AASB 16) AASB 16 is effective for the Group from 1 October 2019 and replaces the previous standard AASB 117 Leases (AASB 117). AASB 16 primarily impacts the Group’s property and technology leases which were previously classified as operating leases. Under AASB 117, operating leases were not recognised on balance sheet and rent payments were expensed over the lease term. Under AASB 16, lessees must recognise all leases (except for leases of low value assets and short term leases) on balance sheet under a single accounting model. Accordingly, the Group will recognise its right to use an underlying leased asset over the lease term as a right-of-use (ROU) asset, and its obligation to make lease payments as a lease liability. In the income statement, the Group will recognise depreciation expense on the ROU asset and interest expense on the lease liability. As a result, lease expenses will be higher in the early periods of a lease and lower in the later periods of the lease compared to the previous standard where expenses were constant over the lease term. Cumulative expenses over the life of a lease will not change. 109 109 ANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 1. ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) The Group will apply the modified retrospective transition approach whereby initial lease liabilities are recognised based on the present value of remaining lease payments as of the transition date. The initial ROU asset recognised for certain large commercial and retail leases will be measured as if AASB 16 had always been applied to the leases. For all other leases, the initial ROU asset will be measured as equal to the initial lease liability. Based on this transition approach, the Group expects to recognise an increase in liabilities of $1.7 billion and an increase in assets of $1.6 billion. This is expected to result in a reduction to opening retained earnings of $82 million and an increase in deferred tax assets of $43 million as of 1 October 2019. Comparative information from prior periods will not be restated. The implementation of AASB 16 requires management to make certain key judgements including the determination of lease terms, discount rates and identifying arrangements that contain a lease. These estimates may be refined as the Group finalises its implementation of the standard in the first half of the 2020 financial year. AASB 17 INSURANCE CONTRACTS (AASB 17) The final version of AASB 17 was issued in July 2017 and is not effective for the Group until 1 October 2021. It will replace AASB 4 Insurance Contracts, AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts and AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts. AASB 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts. The measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements under AASB 17 are significantly different from current accounting standards. Although the overall profit recognised in respect of insurance contracts will not change, it is expected that the timing of profit recognition will change. The impact of AASB 17 is not expected to have material impact on the Group. AASB INTERPRETATION 23 UNCERTAINTY OVER INCOME TAX TREATMENTS (INTERPRETATION 23) In July 2017 the AASB issued Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments. The Interpretation clarifies application of recognition and measurement requirements in AASB 112 Income Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. Interpretation 23 will apply to the Group from 1 October 2019, and is not expected to have a material impact on the Group.",
    "In June 2019 the AASB issued a revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting. The new Framework includes updated definitions and criteria for the recognition and derecognition of assets and liabilities. Additionally it introduces new concepts on measurement, including factors to consider when selecting a measurement basis. The revised Conceptual Framework will apply to the Group from 1 October 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Group.",
    "Interbank offered rates (IBORs), such as LIBOR, are a key reference rate for derivatives, loans and securities for global financial markets. In response to concerns about the transparency and liquidity of IBOR rates, regulators in a number of jurisdictions across the globe are well advanced in developing benchmark rates to phase out and replace IBORs, these projects are collectively known as ‘IBOR Reform’. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is also considering the financial reporting implications of IBOR reform which is expected to impact elements of financial instrument accounting, including hedge accounting, loan modifications, fair value methodologies and disclosures. The IASB project is split into two phases: Phase 1 deals with pre-replacement issues (issues affecting financial reporting in the period before the replacement of IBOR’s); and Phase 2 deals with replacement issues (issues affecting financial reporting when existing IBOR’s are replaced). In September 2019, the IASB issued a final standard, Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 which focuses on ‘pre-rate replacement issues’ and provides exceptions to specific hedge accounting requirements under IAS 39 and IFRS 9 so that entities will be able to apply those hedge accounting requirements under an assumption that the interest rate benchmark is not altered as a result of the interest rate benchmark reform. In October 2019, AASB adopted these amendments in AASB 2019-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform. Although the Group anticipates the new standard, once adopted, will provide certain relief in relation to hedge accounting requirements, for 30 September 2019 reporting purposes, it has considered the existing portfolio of hedge accounted relationships in light of:",
    "the significant uncertainty surrounding the method and timing of transition away from IBORs; and",
    "ongoing application and reliance in capital markets on IBOR’s for financial instrument pricing. As result of the above factors, the Group has concluded that continuation of hedge accounting relationships for potentially impacted hedge relationship remains appropriate. The Group is considering the new standard which is effective on 1 October 2020 but may be adopted earlier. 110 110",

    "NET INTEREST INCOME Interest Income and Expense We recognise interest income and expense for all financial instruments, including those classified as held for trading, assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (applicable from 1 October 2018), available-for-sale assets (applicable prior to 1 October 2018) or designated at fair value through profit or loss in net interest income. For assets held at amortised cost we use the effective interest rate method to calculate amortised cost. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the stream of estimated future cash receipts or payments over the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. For assets subject to prepayment, we determine their expected life on the basis of historical behaviour of the particular asset portfolio - taking into account contractual obligations and prepayment experience. We recognise fees and costs, which form an integral part of the financial instrument (for example loan origination fees and costs), using the effective interest rate method. This is presented as part of interest income or expense depending on whether the underlying financial instrument is a financial asset or financial liability. Major Bank Levy The Major Bank Levy Act 2017 (‘Levy’ or ‘Major bank levy’) applies a rate of 0.06% to certain liabilities of the Company. The Group has determined that the levy represents a finance cost for the Group and $363 million (2018: $355 million) is presented in interest expense in the Income Statement. OTHER OPERATING INCOME Fee and Commission Revenue We recognise fee and commission revenue arising from contracts with customers (a) over time when the performance obligation is satisfied across more than one reporting period or (b) at a point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied immediately or is satisfied within one reporting period. Lending fees exclude fees treated as part of the effective yield calculation of interest income. Lending fees include certain guarantee and commitment fees where the loan or guarantee is not likely to be drawn upon, and other fees charged for providing customers a distinct good or service that are recognised separately from the underlying lending product (including annual package fees that provide benefits on other ANZ products). Non lending fees includes fees associated with deposit and credit card accounts, interchange fees and fees charged for specific customer transactions such as international money transfers. Where the Group provides multiple goods or services to a customer under the same contract, the Group allocates the transaction price of the contract to distinct performance obligations based on the relative stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation. Revenue is recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied. Commissions represent fees from third parties where ANZ acts as an agent by arranging a third party (e.g. an insurance provider) to provide goods and services to a customer. In such cases, ANZ is not primarily responsible for providing the underlying good or service to the customer. If the Group collects funds on behalf of a third party when acting as an agent, the Group only recognises the net commission it retains as revenue. When the commission is variable based on factors outside the control of the Group (e.g. a trail commission), revenue is only recognised if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of the variable amount will not be required in future periods. Funds management income represent fees earned from customers for providing financial advice and fees for asset management services and advice provided to investment funds. Revenue is recognised either at the point the financial advice is provided or over the period in which the asset management services are delivered. Performance fees associated with funds management activities are only recognised when it becomes highly probable the performance hurdle will be achieved. Net Foreign Exchange Earnings and Other Financial Instruments Income We recognise the following as net foreign exchange earnings and other financial instruments income: exchange rate differences arising on the settlement of monetary items and translation differences on monetary items translated at rates different to those at which they were initially recognised or included in a previous financial report; fair value movements (excluding realised and accrued interest) on derivatives that we use to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk on funding instruments not designated as accounting hedges; the ineffective portions of fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges; 112 112",

    "the gain or loss on derecognition of financial assets or liabilities measured at amortised cost. Gain or Loss on Disposal of Non-Financial Assets The gain or loss on the disposal of assets is the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the proceeds of disposal net of costs. This is recognised in other income in the year in which the significant risks and rewards transfer to the buyer. NET INCOME FROM INSURANCE BUSINESS We recognise: premiums received (net of reinsurance premiums paid) based on an assessment of the likely pattern in which risk will emerge over the term of the policies written. This assessment is undertaken periodically and updated in accordance with the latest pattern of risk emergence; and claims incurred net of reinsurance, on an accruals basis once the liability to the policy owner has been established under the terms of the contract and through actuarial assumptions of future claims. SHARE OF ASSOCIATES’ PROFIT The equity method is applied to accounting for associates. Under the equity method, the Group’s share of the after tax results of associates is included in the Income Statement and the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 113 113 ANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 3.

    "OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses are recognised as services are provided to the Group over the period in which an asset is consumed or once a liability is created. SALARIES AND RELATED COSTS - ANNUAL LEAVE, LONG SERVICE LEAVE AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Wages and salaries, annual leave and other employee entitlements expected to be paid or settled within twelve months of employees rendering service are measured at their nominal amounts using remuneration rates that the Group expects to pay when the liabilities are settled. We accrue employee entitlements relating to long service leave using an actuarial calculation. It includes assumptions regarding staff departures, leave utilisation and future salary increases. The result is then discounted using market yields at the reporting date. The market yields are determined from a blended rate of high quality corporate bonds with terms to maturity that closely match the estimated future cash outflows. If we expect to pay short term cash bonuses, then a liability is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount (as a result of past service provided by the employee) and the obligation can be reliably measured. 114 114 20181 $m 4,225 290 243 4,758 468 343 811 990 675 234 1,899 227 248 530 223 55 650 1,706 9,401",

We calculate the fair value of equity settled remuneration at grant date, which is then amortised over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in share capital or the share option reserve as applicable. When we estimate the fair value, we take into account market vesting conditions, such as share price performance conditions. We take non-market vesting conditions, such as service conditions, into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the expense. After the grant of an equity-based award, the amount we recognise as an expense is reversed when non-market vesting conditions are not met, for example an employee fails to satisfy the minimum service period specified in the award on resignation, termination or notice of dismissal for serious misconduct. However, we do not reverse the expense if the award does not vest due to the failure to meet a market-based performance condition.

If the Company fails to pay a dividend or distribution on its ANZ Capital Notes or ANZ Capital Securities on the scheduled payment date, it may (subject to a number of exceptions) be restricted from resolving to pay or paying any dividend on the ANZ ordinary shares. 119 119 ANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 6.

SEGMENT REPORTING DESCRIPTION OF SEGMENTS The Group’s five continuing operating segments are presented on a basis that is consistent with the information provided internally to the Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker. This reflects the way the Group’s businesses are managed, rather than the legal structure of the Group. We measure the performance of these segments on a cash profit basis. To calculate cash profit, we remove certain non-core items from statutory profit. Details of these items are included in the “Other Items” section of this note. Transactions between business units across segments within ANZ are conducted on an arm’s-length basis and disclosed as part of the income and expenses of these segments. The reportable segments are divisions engaged in providing either different products or services or similar products and services in different geographical areas. They are as follows: Australia Retail and Commercial The Australia Retail and Commercial division comprises:",
    "Commercial provides a full range of banking products and financial services including asset financing across the following customer segments: medium to large commercial customers and agribusiness customers across regional Australia, small business owners and high net worth individuals and family groups. Institutional The Institutional division services governments, global institutional and corporate customers across three product sets: Transaction Banking, Loans & Specialised Finance and Markets. Transaction Banking provides working capital and liquidity solutions including documentary trade, supply chain financing, commodity financing as well as cash management solutions, deposits, payments and clearing. Loans & Specialised Finance provides loan products, loan syndication, specialised loan structuring and execution, project and export finance, debt structuring and acquisition finance and corporate advisory. Markets provide risk management services on foreign exchange, interest rates, credit, commodities, debt capital markets in addition to managing the Group's interest rate exposure and liquidity position. New Zealand The New Zealand division comprises:",
    "Commercial provides a full range of banking services including traditional relationship banking and sophisticated financial solutions through dedicated managers focusing on privately owned medium to large enterprises, the agricultural business segment and governments. Pacific The Pacific division provides products and services to retail customers, small to medium-sized enterprises, institutional customers and governments located in the Pacific Islands. Products and services include retail products provided to consumers, traditional relationship banking and sophisticated financial solutions provided to business customers through dedicated managers. Technology, Services & Operations (TSO) and Group Centre TSO and Group Centre provide support to the operating divisions, including technology, group operations, shared services, property, risk management, financial management, strategy, marketing, human resources and corporate affairs. The Group Centre includes residual Asia Retail and Wealth, Group Treasury, Shareholder Functions and minority investments in Asia. Refer to Note 29 Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale for details on discontinued operations. OPERATING SEGMENTS The presentation of divisional results has been impacted by a number of methodology and structural changes during the period. Prior period comparatives have been restated as follows: The methodology for allocating earnings on capital at a business unit level has changed from Economic Capital to Regulatory Capital. While neutral at a Group level, this change has impacted net interest income at the divisional level; The residual Asia Retail and Wealth businesses have been transferred from the former Asia Retail and Pacific division to TSO and Group Centre division. The remaining segment has been renamed Pacific division; and 121 121 ANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 7. SEGMENT REPORTING (continued) OPERATING SEGMENTS (continued) ANZ’s lenders mortgage insurance, share investing, general insurance distribution and financial planning businesses which were previously part of the continuing operations of Wealth Australia now form part of the Australia Retail and Commercial division (previously named Australia division) and Wealth Australia division ceases to exist as a continuing division. The divisional results were also impacted by the adoption of two new accounting standards: AASB 9 - the Group implemented an expected credit loss methodology for impairment of financial assets, and revised the classification and measurement of certain financial assets from 1 October 2018. Consequently, the Group increased its provision for credit impairment by $813 million through opening retained earnings. Comparative information has not been restated. AASB 15 - the main impact of adoption is that certain items previously netted are now presented gross in operating income and operating expenses. Comparative information has been restated which increased total operating income by $153 million and is offset by an increase in total operating expenses of the same amount.

The resultant financial asset classifications are as follows: Amortised cost: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest only and which are held in a business model whose objective is to collect their cash flows; FVOCI: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest only and which are held in a business model whose objective is to collect their cash flows or to sell the assets; and FVTPL: Any other financial assets not falling into the categories above are measured at FVTPL.",

For derivative financial instruments held for trading, gains or losses from changes in the fair value are recognised in profit or loss. For an instrument designated into a hedging relationship, the recognition of gains or losses depends on the nature of the item being hedged. Refer to the previous table on page 129 for profit or loss treatment depending on the hedge type. Sources of hedge ineffectiveness may arise from basis risk and differences in discounting between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The hedging instruments are discounted using Overnight Index Swaps discount curves which are not applied to the hedged items.",
    "To qualify for hedge accounting a hedge is expected to be highly effective. A hedge is highly effective only if the following conditions are met: the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the period for which the hedge is designated (prospective effectiveness); and the actual results of the hedge are within the range of 80-125% (retrospective effectiveness).

The carrying value of equity securities at FVOCI / AFS equity securities is $1,221 million (2018: $1,095 million). This includes the Group’s $1,106 million (2018: $1,025 million) investment in the Bank of Tianjin (BoT).",
    "Policy applicable from 1 October 2018 Investment securities are those financial assets in security form (i.e. transferable debt or equity instruments) that are not held for trading purposes. By way of exception, bills of exchange (a form of security/transferable instrument) which are used to facilitate the Group’s customer lending activities are classified as Loans and advances (rather than Investment securities) to better reflect the substance of the arrangement. Non-traded equity investments may be designated at FVOCI on an instrument by instrument basis. If this election is made, gains or losses are not reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss on disposal of the investment. However, gains or losses may be reclassified within equity. Assets disclosed as Investment securities are subject to the general classification and measurement policy for Financial Assets outlined at the commencement of the Group’s financial asset disclosures on page 125. Additionally, expected credit losses associated with “Investment securities - debt securities at amortised cost” and “Investment securities - debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income” are recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting policy outlined in Note 13. For “Investment securities – debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income” the allowance for ECL is recognised in the FVOCI reserve in equity with a corresponding charge to profit or loss. Policy applicable prior to 1 October 2018 AFS assets comprise non-derivative financial assets which we designate as AFS since we do not hold them principally for trading purposes. They include both equity and debt securities. AFS assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and are revalued at least bi-annually. On revaluation, we include movements in fair value within the available-for-sale revaluation reserve in equity, except for certain items which are recognised directly in profit or loss, being interest on debt securities, dividends received, foreign exchange on debt securities and impairment charges. When we sell the asset, any cumulative gain or loss from the available-for-sale revaluation reserve is recognised in profit or loss. At each reporting date, we assess whether any AFS assets are impaired. We assess the impairment of any debt securities if an event has occurred which will have a negative impact on the asset’s estimated cash flows. For equity securities, we assess if there is a significant or prolonged decline in their fair value below cost. If an AFS asset is impaired, then we remove the cumulative loss related to that asset from the available-for-sale revaluation reserve. We then recognise it in profit or loss for: debt instruments, as a credit impairment expense; and equity instruments, as a negative impact in other operating income. We recognise any later reversals of impairment on debt securities in the profit or loss through the credit impairment charge line. However, we do not make any reversals of impairment for equity securities. To the extent previously impaired equity securities recover in value, gains are recognised directly in equity.",

    "Loans and advances are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and are facilities the Group provides directly to customers or through third party channels. Loans and advances are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the loan or advance, which are primarily brokerage/mortgage origination fees which we amortise over the estimated life of the loan. Subsequently, we then measure loans and advances at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, net of any provision for credit impairment, or at fair value when they are specifically designated on initial recognition as fair value through profit or loss or when held for trading. We classify contracts to lease assets and hire purchase agreements as finance leases if they transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the customer or an unrelated third party. We include these facilities in ‘Other’ in the table above. The Group enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets that are recognised on its balance sheet. When the Group retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets remain on the Group’s balance sheet, however if substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred, the Group derecognises the asset. If the risks and rewards are partially retained and control over the asset is lost, the Group derecognises the asset. If control over the asset is not lost, the Group continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. We separately recognise the rights and obligations retained, or created, in the transfer of assets and liabilities as appropriate. From 1 October 2018, assets disclosed as net loans and advances are subject to the general classification and measurement policy for Financial Assets outlined at the commencement of the Group’s Financial Asset disclosures on page 125.

    "Policy applicable from 1 October 2018",
    "The measurement of expected credit losses reflects an unbiased, probability weighted prediction which evaluates a range of scenarios and takes into account the time value of money, past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Expected credit losses are either measured over 12 months or the expected lifetime of the financial asset, depending on credit deterioration since origination, according to the following three-stage approach: Stage 1: At the origination of a financial asset, and where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, an allowance equivalent to 12 months ECL is recognised reflecting the expected credit losses resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months from the reporting date. For instruments with a remaining maturity of less than 12 months, expected credit losses are estimated based on default events that are possible over the remaining time to maturity. Stage 2: Where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised reflecting expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. If credit risk were to improve in a subsequent period such that the increase in credit risk since origination is no longer considered significant, the exposure returns to a Stage 1 classification and a 12 month ECL applies. Stage 3: Where there is objective evidence of impairment, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised. Expected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for exposures in Stage 1 and Stage 2, and on either a collective or individual basis when transferred to Stage 3.",
    "ECL is calculated as the product of the following credit risk factors at a facility level, discounted to incorporate the time value of money: Probability of default (PD) - the estimate of the likelihood that a borrower will default over a given period; Exposure at default (EAD) - the expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and interest, expected additional drawdowns and accrued interest; and Loss given default (LGD) - the expected loss in the event of the borrower defaulting, expressed as a percentage of the facility's EAD, taking into account direct and indirect recovery costs. These credit risk factors are adjusted for current and forward looking information through the use of macro-economic variables.",
    "When estimating ECL for exposures in Stage 2 and 3, the Group considers the expected lifetime over which it is exposed to credit risk. For non-retail portfolios, the Group uses the maximum contractual period as the expected lifetime for non-revolving credit facilities. For non-retail revolving credit facilities, such as corporate lines of credit, the expected life reflects the Group’s contractual right to withdraw a facility as part of a contractually agreed annual review, after taking into account the applicable notice period. For retail portfolios, the expected lifetime is determined using behavioural term, taking into account expected prepayment behaviour and substantial modifications. DEFINITION OF DEFAULT, CREDIT IMPAIRED AND WRITE-OFFS The definition of default used in measuring expected credit losses is aligned to the definition used for internal credit risk management purposes across all portfolios. This definition is also in line with the regulatory definition of default. Default occurs when there are indicators that a debtor is unlikely to fully satisfy contractual credit obligations to the Group, or the exposure is 90 days past due. Financial assets, including those that are well secured, are considered credit impaired for financial reporting purposes when they default. When there is no realistic probability of recovery, loans are written off against the related impairment allowance on completion of the Group’s internal processes and when all reasonably expected recoveries have been collected. In subsequent periods, any recoveries of amounts previously written-off are credited to credit impairment charge in the income statement. 140 140",
    "13. ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)",
    "If the terms of a financial asset are modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one for either credit or commercial reasons, an assessment is made to determine if the changes to the terms of the existing financial asset are considered substantial. This assessment considers both changes in cash flows arising from the modified terms as well as changes in the overall instrument risk profile; for example, changes in the principal (credit limit), term, or type of underlying collateral. Where a modification is considered non-substantial, the existing financial asset is not derecognised and its date of origination continues to be used to determine SICR. Where a modification is considered substantial, the existing financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at its fair value on the modification date, which also becomes the date of origination used to determine SICR for this new asset. SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CREDIT RISK (SICR) Stage 2 assets are those that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination. In determining what constitutes a SICR, the Group considers both qualitative and quantitative information: i.",
    "For the majority of portfolios, the primary indicator of a SICR is a significant deterioration in the internal credit rating grade of a facility since origination and is measured by application of thresholds. For non-retail portfolios, a SICR is determined by comparing the Customer Credit Rating (CCR) applicable to a facility at reporting date to the CCR at origination of that facility. A CCR is assigned to each borrower which reflects the probability of default of the borrower and incorporates both borrower and non-borrower specific information, including forward looking information. CCRs are subject to review at least annually or more frequently when an event occurs which could affect the credit risk of the customer. For retail portfolios, a SICR is determined by comparing each facility’s scenario weighted lifetime probability of default at the reporting date to the scenario weighted lifetime probability of default at origination. The scenario weighted lifetime probability of default may increase significantly if: there has been a deterioration in the economic outlook, or an increase in economic uncertainty; or there has been a deterioration in the customer’s overall credit position, or ability to manage their credit obligations. ii. Backstop criteria The Group uses 30 days past due arrears as a backstop criteria for both non-retail and retail portfolios. For retail portfolios only, facilities are required to demonstrate three to six months of good payment behaviour prior to being allocated back to Stage 1.",
    "Forward-looking information is incorporated into both our assessment of whether a financial asset has experienced a significant increase in credit risk since its initial recognition and in our estimate of ECL. In applying forward looking information for estimating ECL, the Group considers four probability-weighted forecast economic scenarios as follows: i.",
    "The base case scenario is ANZ’s view of the most likely future macro-economic conditions. It reflects management’s assumptions used for strategic planning and budgeting, and also informs the Group Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) which is the process the Group applies in strategic and capital planning over a 3 year time horizon; ii. Upside and iii. Downside scenarios The upside and downside scenarios are fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions (that is, they are not based on the economic conditions prevailing at balance date) and are based on a combination of more optimistic (in the case of the upside) and pessimistic (in the case of the downside) economic events and uncertainty over long term horizons; and iv. Severe downside scenario The severe downside scenario is fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions and accounts for the potentially severe impact of less likely extremely adverse economic conditions. It reflects macro-economic conditions of a downturn economic event with a probability of occurrence once every 25 years. The four scenarios are described in terms of macro-economic variables used in the PD, LGD and EAD models (collectively the ECL models) depending on the portfolio and country of the borrower. Examples of the variables include unemployment rates, GDP growth rates, house price indices, commercial property price indices and consumer price indices. 141 141 ANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 13. ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)",
    "Probability weighting of each scenario is determined by management considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the base case scenario, as well as specific portfolio considerations where required. The Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO) is responsible for reviewing and approving the base case forecast scenario and the Credit and Market Risk Committee (CMRC) approves the probability weights applied to each scenario. Where applicable, temporary adjustments may be made to account for situations where known or expected risks have not been adequately addressed in the modelling process. CMRC is responsible for approving such adjustments.",
    "The table below illustrates the impact on the Group’s ECL allowance under scenarios where a 100% weighting is applied to both upside and downside scenarios with all other modelling assumptions remaining constant. Total ECL $m Impact $m 100% upside scenario 2,384 (993) 100% downside scenario 5,334 1,956 Policy applicable prior to 1 October 2018 The Group recognises two types of impairment provisions for its loans and advances: Individual provisions for significant assets that are assessed to be impaired; and  Collective provisions for portfolios of similar assets that are assessed collectively for impairment. The accounting treatment for each of them is detailed below:",
    "If any impaired loans and advances exceed specified thresholds and an impairment event has been identified, then we assess the need for a provision individually. To allow for any small value loans and advances where losses may have been incurred but not yet identified, and individually significant loans and advances that we do not assess as impaired, we assess them collectively in pools of assets with similar credit risk characteristics.",
    "Loans and advances are assessed as impaired if we have objective evidence that we may not recover principal or interest payments (that is, a loss event has been incurred). We estimate the provision on the basis of historical loss experience for assets with similar credit risk characteristics to others in the respective collective pool. We adjust the historical loss experience based on current observable data – such as: changing economic conditions, the impact of the inherent risk of large concentrated losses within the portfolio and an assessment of the economic cycle.",
    "We measure impairment loss as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and estimated future cash flows discounted to their present value at the asset’s original effective interest rate. We record the result as an expense in profit or loss in the period we identify the impairment and recognise a corresponding reduction in the carrying amount of loans and advances through an offsetting provision.",
    "If we recover any cash flows from loans and advances we have previously written off, then we recognise the recovery in profit or loss in the period the cash flows are received. Off-balance sheet amounts Any off-balance sheet items, such as loan commitments, are considered for impairment both on an individual and collective basis. 142 142",
    "Applicable from 1 October 2018 When estimating the allowance for expected credit losses for loans and advances, we used management’s judgement in respect of the matters outlined below.",
    "In the measurement of ECL, judgement is involved in setting the rules to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition of a loan, resulting in the financial asset moving from ‘stage 1’ to ‘stage 2’. This is a key area of judgement as transition from stage 1 to stage 2 increases the ECL calculation from an allowance based on the probability of default in the next 12 months, to an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses. Subsequent decreases in credit risk combined with transition from stage 2 to stage 1 may similarly result in significant changes in the ECL allowance. Measuring both 12-month and lifetime credit losses The setting of precise trigger points requires judgement which may have a material impact upon the size of the ECL allowance. The Group monitors the effectiveness of SICR criteria on an ongoing basis. The PD, LGD, and EAD credit risk parameters used in determining ECL are point-in-time measures reflecting the relevant forward looking information determined by management. Judgement is involved in determining which forward-looking information variables are relevant for particular lending portfolios and for determining each portfolio’s point-in-time sensitivity. In addition, judgement is required where behavioural characteristics are applied in estimating the lifetime of a facility to be used in measuring ECL. All other things being equal, an increase in the expected behavioural life will increase the amount of ECL. Forecasting forward-looking scenarios Our forecast of forward looking information variables is established from a “base case” or most likely scenario that is used internally by management for planning and forecasting purposes. The expected outcomes of key economic drivers for the base case scenario as at 30 September 2019 are as follows: Australia The unemployment rate is expected to remain essentially flat and GDP growth to improve modestly over the forecast period, with residential property values expected to improve after a period of decline. Commercial property prices are expected to decline slightly through the forecast period. Consumer price index growth is expected to rise from current levels. New Zealand GDP growth is forecast to improve modestly over the forecast period, with the unemployment rate remaining stable. Residential property values are expected to achieve modest levels of growth. Commercial property prices are expected to grow, however, the growth rate is expected to be modest through the forecast period. The consumer price index is expected to rise modestly. Rest of world GDP growth is forecast to taper lower in the near term due to uncertainty in the global outlook. Inflation is also expected to remain soft over the forecast period to 2020.",
    "Probability weighting of each scenario is determined by management considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the base case scenario, as well as specific portfolio considerations where required.",
    "Management temporary adjustments to the ECL allowance are adjustments we use in circumstances where we judge that our existing inputs, assumptions and model techniques do not capture all the risk factors relevant to our lending portfolios. Emerging local or global macroeconomic, microeconomic or political events, and natural disasters that are not incorporated into our current parameters, risk ratings, or forward-looking information are examples of such circumstances. The use of management temporary adjustments may impact the amount of ECL recognised. 143 143 ANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 13.

Where financial liabilities are designated as measured at fair value, gains or losses relating to changes in the entity’s own credit risk are included in other comprehensive income, except where doing so would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss.

    "AN OVERVIEW OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK This overview is provided to aid the users of the financial statements to understand the context of the financial disclosures required under AASB 7. It should be read in conjunction with the Governance and Risk Management section. The Board is responsible for establishing and overseeing the Group’s Risk Management Framework (RMF). The Board has delegated authority to the Board Risk Committee (BRC) to develop and monitor compliance with the Group’s risk management policies. The BRC reports regularly to the Board on its activities. The Board approves the strategic objectives of the Group including: the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS), which sets out the Board’s expectations regarding the degree of risk that ANZ is prepared to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives and business plan; and the Risk Management Strategy (RMS), which describes ANZ’s strategy for managing risks and the key elements of the RMF that gives effect to this strategy. This includes a description of each material risk, and an overview of how the RMF addresses each risk, with reference to the relevant policies, standards and procedures. It also includes information on how ANZ identifies measures, evaluates, monitors, reports and controls or mitigates material risks. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and robust control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. At ANZ, risk is everyone’s responsibility. The Group has an independent risk management function, headed by the Chief Risk Officer who: is responsible for overseeing the risk profile and the risk management framework; can effectively challenge activities and decisions that materially affect ANZ’s risk profile; and has an independent reporting line to the BRC to enable the appropriate escalation of issues of concern. The Internal Audit Function reports directly to the Board Audit Committee (BAC). Internal Audit provides: an independent evaluation of the Group’s RMF annually that seeks to ensure compliance with, and the effectiveness of, the risk management framework; facilitation of a comprehensive review every three years that seeks to ensure that the appropriateness, effectiveness and adequacy of the risk management framework; and recommendations to improve the framework and/or work practices to strengthen the effectiveness of day to day operations. 152 152",

    "CREDIT RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES Granting credit facilities to customers is one of the Group’s major sources of income. As this activity is also a principal risk, the Group dedicates considerable resources to its management. The Group assumes credit risk in a wide range of lending and other activities in diverse markets and in many jurisdictions. Credit risks arise from traditional lending to customers as well as from interbank, treasury, trade finance and capital markets activities around the world. Our credit risk management framework ensures we apply a consistent approach across the Group when we measure, monitor and manage the credit risk appetite set by the Board. The Board is assisted and advised by the BRC in discharging its duty to oversee credit risk. The BRC: sets the credit risk appetite and credit strategies; and approves credit transactions beyond the discretion of executive management. We quantify credit risk through an internal credit rating system (masterscales) to ensure consistency across exposure types and to provide a consistent framework for reporting and analysis. The system uses models and other tools to measure the following for customer exposures: Probability of Default (PD) Expressed by a Customer Credit Rating (CCR), reflecting the Group’s assessment of a customer’s ability to service and repay debt. Exposure at Default (EAD) The expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and interest, expected additional draw downs and accrued interest at the time of default. Loss Given Default (LGD) Expressed by a Security Indicator (SI) ranging from A to G. The SI is calculated by reference to the percentage of loan covered by security which the Group can realise if a customer defaults. The A-G scale is supplemented by a range of other SIs which cover factors such as cash cover and sovereign backing. For retail and some small business lending, we group exposures into large homogenous pools – and the LGD is assigned at the pool level. Our specialist credit risk teams develop and validate the Group’s PD and LGD rating models. The outputs from these models drive our day-to-day credit risk management decisions including origination, pricing, approval levels, regulatory capital adequacy, economic capital allocation, and credit provisioning. All customers with whom ANZ has a credit relationship are assigned a CCR at origination via either of the following assessment approaches:",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) CREDIT RISK (continued) The Group has adopted AASB 9 effective from 1 October 2018 which has resulted in changes to the classification and measurement of financial assets, including the impairment of financial assets. The presentation of credit risk information for 2019 has been amended. Refer to Note 1 and 35 for further details on key requirements and impacts of the changes due to the adoption of AASB 9. MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK For financial assets recognised on the balance sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount. In certain circumstances there may be differences between the carrying amounts reported on the balance sheet and the amounts reported in the tables below. Principally, these differences arise in respect of financial assets that are subject to risks other than credit risk, such as equity instruments which are primarily subject to market risk, or bank notes and coins. For undrawn facilities, this maximum exposure to credit risk is the full amount of the committed facilities. For contingent exposures, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount the Group would have to pay if the instrument is called upon. For the purpose of this note, assets presented as assets held for sale in the Balance Sheet have been reallocated to their respective Balance Sheet categories.

    "We use collateral for on and off-balance sheet exposures to mitigate credit risk if a counterparty cannot meet its repayment obligations. Where there is sufficient collateral, an expected credit loss is not recognised. This is largely the case for certain lending products that are secured by corresponding investment for which the margin loans are utilised and for reverse repurchase agreements. For some products, the collateral provided by customers is fundamental to the product’s structuring, so it is not strictly the secondary source of repayment - for example, lending secured by trade receivables is typically repaid by the collection of those receivables. During the period there was no change in our collateral policies. The nature of collateral or security held for the relevant classes of financial assets is as follows:",
    "Loans - housing and personal Housing loans are secured by mortgage(s) over property and additional security may take the form of guarantees and deposits. Personal lending (including credit cards and overdrafts) is predominantly unsecured. If we take security, then it is restricted to eligible vehicles, motor homes and other assets. Loans - business Business loans may be secured, partially secured or unsecured. Typically, we take security by way of a mortgage over property and/or a charge over the business or other assets.

However, the collateral may be implicit in the terms of the instrument (for example, with an asset-backed security). The terms of debt securities may include collateralisation. For derivatives, we typically terminate all contracts with the counterparty and settle on a net basis at market levels current at the time of a counterparty default under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreements. Our preferred practice is to use a Credit Support Annex (CSA) to the ISDA so that open derivative positions with the counterparty are aggregated and cash collateral (or other forms of eligible collateral) is exchanged daily. The collateral is provided by the counterparty when their position is out of the money (or provided to the counterparty by ANZ when our position is out of the money). Off-balance sheet positions",

    "MARKET RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES Market risk stems from the Group’s trading and balance sheet management activities and the impact of changes and correlation between interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads and volatility in bond, commodity or equity prices. The BRC delegates responsibility for day-to-day management of both market risks and compliance with market risk policies to the Credit & Market Risk Committee (CMRC) and the Group Asset & Liability Committee (GALCO). Within overall strategies and policies established by the BRC, business units and risk management have joint responsibility for the control of market risk at the Group level. The Market Risk team (a specialist risk management unit independent of the business) allocates market risk limits at various levels and monitors and reports on them daily. This detailed framework allocates individual limits to manage and control exposures using risk factors and profit and loss limits. Management, measurement and reporting of market risk is undertaken in two broad categories:",
    "Non-Traded Market Risk Risk of loss from changes in the value of financial instruments due to movements in price factors for both physical and derivative trading positions. Principal risk categories monitored are: 1. Currency risk – potential loss arising from changes in foreign exchange rates or their implied volatilities. 2. Interest rate risk – potential loss from changes in market interest rates or their implied volatilities. Risk of loss associated with the management of non-traded interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange exposures. This includes interest rate risk in the banking book. This risk of loss arises from adverse changes in the overall and relative level of interest rates for different tenors, differences in the actual versus expected net interest margin, and the potential valuation risk associated with embedded options in financial instruments and bank products. 3. Credit spread risk – potential loss arising from a movement in margin or spread relative to a benchmark. 4. Commodity risk – potential loss arising from changes in commodity prices or their implied volatilities. 5. Equity risk – potential loss arising from changes in equity prices. MEASUREMENT OF MARKET RISK We primarily manage and control market risk using Value at Risk (VaR), sensitivity analysis and stress testing. VaR gauges the Group’s possible daily loss based on historical market movements. The Group’s VaR approach for both traded and non-traded risk is historical simulation. We use historical changes in market rates, prices and volatilities over: the previous 500 business days, to calculate standard VaR, and  a 1-year stressed period, to calculate stressed VaR. We calculate traded and non-traded VaR using one-day and ten-day holding periods. For stressed VaR, we use a ten-day period. Back testing is used to ensure our VaR models remain accurate. ANZ measures VaR at a 99% confidence interval which means there is a 99% chance that a loss will not exceed the VaR for the relevant holding period. 160 160",

Non-traded market risk Balance sheet risk management The principal objectives of balance sheet risk management are to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk to mitigate the negative impact of movements in interest rates on the earnings and market value of the Group’s banking book, while ensuring the Group maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations as they fall due. Interest rate risk management Non-traded interest rate risk relates to the potential adverse impact of changes in market interest rates on the Group’s future net interest income. This risk arises from two principal sources, namely mismatches between the repricing dates of interest bearing assets and liabilities; and the investment of capital and other non-interest bearing liabilities in interest bearing assets. Interest rate risk is reported using VaR and scenario analysis (based on the impact of a 1% rate shock). The table below shows VaR figures for non-traded interest rate risk for the combined Group as well as Australia, New Zealand and Asia Pacific, Europe and Americas (APEA) geographies which are calculated separately. 2019 2018 As at $m High for year $m Low for year $m Average for year $m As at $m High for year $m Low for year $m Average for year $m Non-traded value at risk 99% confidence",

The market risk impact on these equity investments is not captured by the Group’s VaR processes for traded and non-traded market risks. Therefore, the Group regularly reviews the valuations of the investments within the portfolio and assesses whether the investments are appropriately measured based on the recognition and measurement policies set out in Note 11 Investment securities. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK – STRUCTURAL EXPOSURES Our investment of capital in foreign operations - for example, branches, subsidiaries or associates with functional currencies other than the Australian Dollar - exposes the Group to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates. Variations in the value of these foreign operations arising as a result of exchange differences are reflected in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. Where it is considered appropriate, the Group takes out economic hedges against larger foreign exchange denominated revenue streams (primarily New Zealand Dollar, US Dollar and US Dollar correlated). The primary objective of hedging is to ensure that, if practical, the consolidated capital ratios are neutral to the effect of changes in exchange rates. 162 162 20181 1.21% 1.79% 0.77% 1.11%",
    "LIQUIDITY RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is either: unable to meet its payment obligations (including repaying depositors or maturing wholesale debt) when they fall due; or  does not have the appropriate amount, tenor and composition of funding and liquidity to fund increases in its assets. Management of liquidity and funding risks are overseen by GALCO. The Group’s liquidity and funding risks are governed by a set of principles approved by the BRC and include: maintaining the ability to meet all payment obligations in the immediate term;  ensuring that the Group has the ability to meet ‘survival horizons’ under a range of ANZ specific, and general market, liquidity stress scenarios, at the site and Group-wide level, to meet cash flow obligations over the short to medium term; maintaining strength in the Group’s balance sheet structure to ensure long term resilience in the liquidity and funding risk profile;  ensuring the liquidity management framework is compatible with local regulatory requirements;  preparing daily liquidity reports and scenario analysis to quantify the Group’s positions;  targeting a diversified funding base to avoid undue concentrations by investor type, maturity, market source and currency;  holding a portfolio of high quality liquid assets to protect against adverse funding conditions and to support day-to-day operations; and  establishing detailed contingency plans to cover different liquidity crisis events.",
    "Scenario modelling of funding sources ANZ’s liquidity risk appetite is defined by a range of regulatory and internal liquidity metrics mandated by the Board. The metrics cover a range of scenarios of varying duration and level of severity. A key component of this framework is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which is a severe short term liquidity stress scenario mandated by banking regulators including APRA. As part of meeting LCR requirements, the Group has a Committed Liquidity Facility (CLF) with the Reserve Bank of Australia. The CLF has been established to offset the shortage of available High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) in Australia and provides an alternative form of contingent liquidity. The total amount of the CLF available to a qualifying Australian Deposit-taking Institution is set annually by APRA. From 1 January 2019, ANZ’s CLF is $48.0 billion (2018 calendar year end: $46.9 billion). Liquid assets The Group holds a portfolio of high quality (unencumbered) liquid assets to protect the Group’s liquidity position in a severely stressed environment, to meet regulatory requirements. HQLA comprise three categories consistent with Basel III LCR requirements: HQLA1- Cash and highest credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities eligible for repurchase with central banks to provide same-day liquidity. HQLA2 - High credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities, high quality corporate debt securities and high quality covered bonds eligible for repurchase with central banks to provide same-day liquidity. Alternative liquid assets (ALA) - Assets qualifying as collateral for the CLF and eligible securities that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will accept in its domestic market operations. LIQUIDITY RISK OUTCOMES1 Liquidity Coverage Ratio ANZ’s Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) averaged 140% for 2019, an increase from the 2018 average of 138%, and above the regulatory minimum of 100%. Net Stable Funding Ratio ANZ’s Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) as at 30 September 2019 was 116% (2018: 115%), above the regulatory minimum of 100%. 1.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES The Group carries a significant number of financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. In addition the Group also holds assets classified as held for sale which are measured at fair value less costs to sell. The fair value is the best estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. VALUATION The Group has an established control framework, including appropriate segregation of duties, to ensure that fair values are accurately determined, reported and controlled. The framework includes the following features: products are approved for transacting with external customers and counterparties only where fair values can be appropriately determined; quoted market prices used to value financial instruments are independently verified with information from external pricing providers; fair value methodologies and inputs are evaluated and approved by a function independent of the party that undertakes the transaction; movements in fair values are independently monitored and explained by reference to underlying factors relevant to the fair value; and valuation adjustments (such as funding valuation adjustments, credit valuation adjustments and bid-offer adjustments) are independently validated and monitored. If the Group holds offsetting risk positions, then the Group uses the portfolio exception in AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement (AASB 13) to measure the fair value of such groups of financial assets and financial liabilities. We measure the portfolio based on the price that would be received to sell a net long position (an asset) for a particular risk exposure, or to transfer a net short position (a liability) for a particular risk exposure.",
    "We designate certain loans and advances and certain deposits and other borrowings and debt issuances as fair value through profit or loss: where they contain a separable embedded derivative which significantly modifies the instruments’ cash flow; or in order to eliminate an accounting mismatch which would arise if the asset or liabilities were otherwise carried at amortised cost. This mismatch arises as we measure the derivative financial instruments (which we acquired to mitigate interest rate risk of the assets or liabilities) at fair value through profit or loss. Our approach ensures that we recognise the fair value movements on the assets or liabilities in profit or loss in the same period as the movement on the associated derivatives. We may also designate certain loans and advances, certain deposits and other borrowings and debt issuances as fair value through profit or loss where they are managed on a fair value basis to align the measurement with how the instruments are managed. FAIR VALUE APPROACH AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES We use valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities for recognition, measurement and disclosure purposes where no quoted price in an active market exists for that asset or liability.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (continued) Bank of Tianjin (BoT) The investment is valued based on comparative price-to-book (P/B) multiples (a P/B multiple is the ratio of the market value of equity to the book value of equity). The extent of judgement applied in determining the appropriate multiple and comparator group from which the multiple is derived are non-observable inputs which have resulted in the Level 3 classification. Sensitivity to Level 3 data inputs When we make assumptions due to significant inputs not being directly observable in the market place (Level 3 inputs), then changing these assumptions changes the Group’s estimate of the instrument’s fair value. Favourable and unfavourable changes are determined by changing the primary unobservable parameter used to derive the valuation. Bank of Tianjin (BoT) The valuation of the BoT investment is sensitive to the selected unobservable input, being the P/B multiple. If the P/B multiple was increased or decreased by 10% it would result in a $111 million (2018: $102 million) increase or decrease to the fair value of the investment, which would be recognised in shareholders’ equity.

The majority of valuation models the Group uses employ only observable market data as inputs. However, for certain financial instruments, we may use data that is not readily observable in current markets. If we use unobservable market data, then we need to exercise more judgement to determine fair value depending on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation. Generally, we derive unobservable inputs from other relevant market data and compare them to observed transaction prices where available. When establishing the fair value of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, the Group considers valuation adjustments in determining the fair value. We may apply adjustments (such as bid/offer spreads, credit valuation adjustments and funding valuation adjustments – refer Note 10 Derivative Financial Instruments) to the techniques used to reflect the Group’s assessment of factors that market participants would consider in setting fair value. 170 170",

GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO CASH-GENERATING UNITS (CGUs) An annual assessment is made as to whether the current carrying value of goodwill is impaired. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated at the date of acquisition to a CGU. Goodwill is considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of the relevant CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. To estimate the recoverable amount of the CGU to which each goodwill component is allocated, we use a fair value less cost of disposal assessment approach for each segment. FAIR VALUE LESS COST OF DISPOSAL The Group has determined, using a market multiple approach, the fair value less costs of disposal of each CGU. This is primarily based on observable price earnings multiples reflecting the businesses and markets in which each CGU operates plus a control premium. The earnings are based on the current forecast earnings of the divisions. As at 30 September 2019, our impairment testing did not result in any material impairment being identified. For each of ANZ’s CGUs with goodwill, the price earnings multiples applied were as follows:",

    "Management judgement is used to assess the recoverable value of goodwill, and other intangible assets, and the useful economic life of an asset, or if an asset has an indefinite life. We reassess the recoverability of the carrying value at each reporting date. The carrying amount of goodwill is based on judgements including the basis of assumptions and forecasts used for determining earnings for CGUs, headroom availability, and sensitivities of the forecasts to reasonably possible changes in assumptions. The level at which goodwill is allocated, the estimation of future earnings and the selection of earnings multiples applied requires significant judgement. At each balance date, software and other intangible assets, including those not yet ready for use, are assessed for indicators of impairment. In the event that an asset’s carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount, the carrying value of the asset is written down immediately. In addition, the expected useful life of intangible assets, including software assets, are assessed at each reporting date. The assessment requires management judgement, and in relation to our software assets, a number of factors can influence the expected useful lives. These factors include changes to business strategy, significant divestments and the underlying pace of technological change. 174 174",

The amount recognised is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the timing and amount of the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the estimated cash flows required to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.",
    "The Group holds provisions for various obligations including customer remediation, restructuring costs and surplus lease space, non- lending losses, fraud and forgeries and litigation related claims. These provisions involve judgements regarding the timing and outcome of future events, including estimates of expenditure required to satisfy such obligations. Where relevant, expert legal advice has been obtained and, in light of such advice, provisions and/or disclosures as deemed appropriate have been made. In relation to customer remediation, determining the amount of the provisions, which represent management’s best estimate of the cost of settling the identified matters, requires the exercise of significant judgement. It will often be necessary to form a view on a number of different assumptions, including, the number of impacted customers, the average refund per customer, the associated remediation project costs, and the implications of regulatory exposures and customer claims having regard to their specific facts and circumstances. Consequently, the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions is reviewed on a regular basis against actual experience and other relevant evidence including expert legal advices and adjustments are made to the provisions where appropriate. 176 176",

    "ANZ’s capital management strategy aims to protect the interests of depositors, creditors and shareholders. We achieve this through an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) whereby ANZ conducts detailed strategic and capital planning over a 3 year time horizon. The process involves: forecasting economic variables, financial performance of ANZ’s divisions and the financial impact of new strategic initiatives to be implemented during the planning period; performing stress tests under different economic scenarios to determine the level of additional capital (‘stress capital buffer’) needed to absorb losses that may be experienced under an economic downturn; reviewing capital ratios and targets across various classes of capital against ANZ’s risk profile; and  developing a capital plan, taking into account capital ratio targets, current and future capital issuances requirements and options around capital products, timing and markets to execute the capital plan under differing market and economic conditions. The capital plan is approved by the Board and updated as required. The Board and senior management are provided with regular updates of ANZ’s capital position. Any material actions required to ensure ongoing prudent capital management are submitted to the Board for approval. Throughout the year, the Group maintained compliance with all the regulatory requirements related to Capital Adequacy in the jurisdictions in which it operates.",
    "Australia As ANZ is an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) in Australia, it is primarily regulated by APRA under the Banking Act 1959 (Cth). ANZ must comply with the minimum regulatory capital requirements, prudential capital ratios and specific reporting levels that APRA sets and which are consistent with the global Basel III capital framework.

APRA also requires the ADI to hold additional CET1 buffers as follows: A capital conservation buffer (CCB) of 3.5% which is inclusive of the additional 1% surcharge for domestically systemically important banks (D-SIBs). APRA has determined that ANZ is a D-SIB. A countercyclical capital buffer which is set on a jurisdictional basis. The requirement is currently set to zero for Australia. ANZ reports to APRA on a Level 1 and Level 2 basis, and measures capital adequacy monthly on a Level 1 and Level 2 basis, and is not yet required to maintain capital on a Level 3 basis (APRA have yet to conclude required timing for Level 3 reporting). Life Insurance and Funds Management As required by APRA’s Prudential Standards, insurance and funds management activities are: de-consolidated for the purposes of calculating capital adequacy; and  excluded from the risk based capital adequacy framework.

Such transactions involve transfers to an internal securitisation (bankruptcy remote) vehicle used to create assets that are eligible for repurchase under agreements with the applicable central bank (these are known as ‘Repo eligible’). These internal securitisation SEs are consolidated. Refer to Note 28 Transfers of Financial Assets for further details. The Group also establishes SEs on behalf of customers to securitise their loans or receivables. The Group may manage these securitisation vehicles or provide liquidity or other support. Additionally, the Group may acquire interests in securitisation vehicles set up by third parties through holding securities issued by such entities. In limited circumstances where control exists, the Group consolidates the SE.",
    "Certain loans and advances have been assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs to provide security for issuances of debt securities by the Group. The Group retains control over these SEs and therefore they are consolidated. Refer to Note 28 Transfers of Financial Assets for further details.",
    "The Group is involved with SEs established: in connection with structured lending transactions to facilitate debt syndication and/or to ring-fence collateral; and to own assets that are leased to customers in structured leasing transactions. The Group may manage the SE, hold minor amounts of the SE’s capital, or provide risk management products (derivatives) to the SE. In most instances, the Group does not control these SEs. In limited circumstances where control exists, the Group consolidates the SE.",
    "The Group conducts investment management and other fiduciary activities as a responsible entity, trustee, custodian or manager for investment funds and trusts – including superannuation funds and wholesale and retail trusts (collectively ‘Investment Funds’). The Investment Funds are financed through the issuance of puttable units to investors and the Group considers them to be SEs. The Group’s exposure to Investment Funds is limited to receiving fees for services and derivatives entered into for risk management purposes. These interests do not create significant exposures to the funds that would allow the Group to control the funds. Therefore, the funds are not consolidated. 186 186",

    "FINANCIAL OR OTHER SUPPORT PROVIDED TO CONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES The Group provides financial support to consolidated SEs as outlined below. As these are intra-group transactions, they are eliminated on consolidation:",
    "The Group provides lending facilities, derivatives and commitments to these SEs and/or holds debt instruments that they have issued.",
    "The assets held by these SEs are normally pledged as collateral for financing provided. Certain consolidated SEs are financed entirely by the Group while others are financed by syndicated loan facilities in which the Group is a participant. The financing provided by the Group includes lending facilities where the Group’s exposure is limited to the amount of the loan and any undrawn amount. Additionally, the Group has provided Letters of Support to these consolidated SEs confirming that the Group will not demand repayment of the financing provided for the ensuing 12 month period. The Group did not provide any non-contractual support to consolidated SEs during the year (2018: nil). Other than as disclosed above, the Group does not have any current intention to provide financial or other support to consolidated SEs.",
    "GROUP’S INTEREST IN UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES An ‘interest’ in an unconsolidated SE is any form of contractual or non-contractual involvement with a SE that exposes the Group to variability of returns from the performance of that SE. These interests include, but are not limited to: holdings of debt or equity securities; derivatives that pass-on risks specific to the performance of the SE; lending; loan commitments; financial guarantees; and fees from funds management activities. For the purpose of disclosing interests in unconsolidated SEs: no disclosure is made if the Group’s involvement is not more than a passive interest - for example: when the Group’s involvement constitutes a typical customer-supplier relationship. On this basis, exposures to unconsolidated SEs that arise from lending, trading and investing activities are not considered disclosable interests - unless the design of the structured entity allows the Group to participate in decisions about the relevant activities (being those that significantly affect the entity’s returns). ‘interests’ do not include derivatives intended to expose the Group to market-risk (rather than performance risk specific to the SE) or derivatives through which the Group creates, rather than absorbs, variability of the unconsolidated SE (such as purchase of credit protection under a credit default swap).

Available-for-sale classification used in comparative periods ceases to exist under AASB 9 and a new classification of investment securities was introduced. Refer Note 1 and 35 for further details. Comparative information has not been restated. In addition to the interests above, the Group earned funds management fees from unconsolidated SEs of $509 million (2018: $505 million) during the year. 187 187 ANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 27. STRUCTURED ENTITIES (continued) The Group’s maximum exposure to loss represents the maximum amount of loss that the Group could incur as a result of its involvement with unconsolidated SEs if loss events were to take place — regardless of the probability of occurrence. This does not in any way represent the actual losses expected to be incurred. Furthermore, the maximum exposure to loss is stated gross of the effects of hedging and collateral arrangements entered into to mitigate ANZ’s exposure to loss. The maximum exposure to loss has been determined as: the carrying amount of Investment securities measured at amortised cost (from 1 October 2018), available-for-sale assets (prior to 1 October 2018) and investments backing policy liabilities; and the carrying amount plus the undrawn amount of any committed loans and advances. Information about the size of the unconsolidated SEs that the Group is involved with is as follows: Securitisation and structured finance: size is indicated by total assets which vary by SE with a maximum value of approximately $1.1 billion (2018: $1.0 billion); and Investment funds: size is indicated by Funds Under Management which vary by SE with a maximum value of approximately $38.8 billion (2018: $36.9 billion). The Group did not provide any non-contractual support to unconsolidated SEs during the year (2018: nil) nor does it have any current intention to provide financial or other support to unconsolidated SEs.",
    "The Group may also sponsor unconsolidated SEs in which it has no disclosable interest. For the purposes of this disclosure, the Group considers itself the ‘sponsor’ of an unconsolidated SE if it is the primary party involved in the design and establishment of that SE and: the Group is the major user of that SE; or the Group’s name appears in the name of that SE, or on its products; or the Group provides implicit or explicit guarantees of that SE’s performance. The Group has sponsored the ANZ PIE Fund in New Zealand, which invests only in deposits with ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited. The Group does not provide any implicit or explicit guarantees of the capital value or performance of investments in the ANZ PIE Fund. There was no income received from, nor assets transferred to, this entity during the year.",
    "Significant judgement is required in assessing whether control exists over Structured Entities involved in securitisation activities and structured finance transactions, and investment funds. Judgement is required to determine the existence of: power over the relevant activities (being those that significantly affect the entity’s returns); and exposure to variable returns of that entity. 188 188",
    "28. TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS In the normal course of business the Group enters into transactions where it transfers financial assets directly to third parties or to SEs. These transfers may give rise to the Group fully, or partially, derecognising those financial assets - depending on the Group’s exposure to the risks and rewards or control over the transferred assets. If the Group retains substantially all of the risk and rewards of a transferred asset, the transfer does not qualify for derecognition and the asset remains on the Group’s balance sheet in its entirety. SECURITISATIONS Net loans and advances include residential mortgages securitised under the Group’s securitisation programs which are assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs to provide security for obligations payable on the notes issued by the SEs. The holders of the issued notes have full recourse to the pool of residential mortgages which have been securitised and the Group cannot otherwise pledge or dispose of the transferred assets. In some instances the Group is also the holder of the securitised notes. In addition, the Group is entitled to any residual income of the SEs and sometimes enters into derivatives with the SEs. The Group retains the risks and rewards of the residential mortgages and continues to recognise the mortgages as financial assets. The obligation to pay this amount to the SE is recognised as a financial liability of the Group. The Group is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with these securitisation SEs and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the SEs activities. The SEs are therefore consolidated by the Group. COVERED BONDS The Group operates various global covered bond programs to raise funding in its primary markets. Net loans and advances include residential mortgages assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs associated with these covered bond programs. The mortgages provide security for the obligations payable on the issued covered bonds. The covered bond holders have dual recourse to the issuer and the cover pool of assets. The issuer cannot otherwise pledge or dispose of the transferred assets, however, subject to legal arrangements it may repurchase and substitute assets as long as the required cover is maintained. The Group is required to maintain the cover pool at a level sufficient to cover the bond obligations. In addition, the Group is entitled to any residual income of the covered bond SEs and enters into derivatives with the SEs. The Group retains the majority of the risks and rewards of the residential mortgages and continues to recognise the mortgages as financial assets. The obligation to pay this amount to the SEs is recognised as a financial liability of the Group. The Group is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with the covered bond SEs and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the SEs activities. The SEs are therefore consolidated by the Group. The covered bonds issued externally are included within debt issuances. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS When the Group sells securities subject to repurchase agreements under which we retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, then those assets do not qualify for derecognition. An associated liability is recognised for the consideration received from the counterparty. STRUCTURED FINANCE ARRANGEMENTS The Group arranges funding for certain customer transactions through structured leasing and commodity prepayment arrangements. These transactions are recognised on Group’s balance sheet as lease receivables or loans. At times, other financial institutions participate in the funding of these arrangements. This participation involves a proportionate transfer of the rights to the assets recognised by the Group. The participating banks have limited recourse to the leased assets or financed commodity and related proceeds. Where the Group continues to be exposed to some of the risks of the transferred assets through a derivative or other continuing involvement, the Group does not derecognise the lease receivable or loan. Instead, the Group recognises an associated liability representing its obligations to the participating financial institutions. The table below sets out the balance of assets transferred that do not qualify for derecognition, along with the associated liabilities: Securitisations1,2",

    "On 17 October 2017, the Group announced it had agreed to sell its OnePath P&I and ADGs business to IOOF. The sale of the ADGs business completed on 1 October 2018. On 17 October 2019, the Group announced it had agreed a revised sale price for its OnePath P&I business and ADGs to IOOF of $850 million, being a $125 million reduction from the original sale price of $975 million announced in October 2017. The new price of $850 million includes approximately $25 million that ANZ has already received for the sale of the ADGs in October 2018. The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements. Subject to APRA approval, the Group expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. The impact of the reduction in price has been reflected in the 2019 financial results. On 12 December 2017, ANZ announced that it had agreed to the sale of its life insurance business to Zurich Financial Services Australia (Zurich) and regulatory approval was obtained on 10 October 2018.

    "LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACT LIABILITIES AND LIABILITIES CEDED UNDER REINSURANCE CONTRACTS We calculate Life insurance contract Liabilities under the Margin on Service (MoS) model using a projection method based on actuarial principles and standards. We discount the expected future cash flows of these contracts at the risk-free discount rate. LIFE INVESTMENT CONTRACT LIABILITIES A life investment contract liability is measured at fair value and is directly linked to the fair value of the assets that back it. For guaranteed policies, we determine the liability as the net present value of expected cash flows, subject to a minimum of current surrender value. EXTERNAL UNIT HOLDER LIABILITIES The life insurance business includes controlling interests in investment funds which we aggregate. When we aggregate a controlled investment fund, we recognise the external unit holder liabilities as a liability and include them on the balance sheet in external unit holder liabilities. INVESTMENTS BACKING POLICY LIABILITIES Our determination of fair value of investments backing policy liabilities involves the same judgement as other financial assets as described in Note 17 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. 192 192",
    "29. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE (continued)",
    "A significant level of judgement is used by the Group to determine: whether an asset or group of assets is classified and presented as held for sale or as a discontinued operation; and the fair value of the assets and liabilities classified as being held for sale. Management is required to exercise significant judgement when assessing the fair value less costs to sell for assets and liabilities held for sale. The judgemental factors include determining: costs to sell, allocation of goodwill, indemnities provided under the sale contract and consideration received - particularly where elements of consideration are contingent in nature. Any impairment we record is based on the best available evidence of fair value compared to the carrying value before the impairment. The final sale price may be different to the fair value we estimate when recording the impairment. Management regularly assess the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions against actual outcomes and other relevant evidence and adjustments are made to fair value where appropriate. We expect that the sales will complete within 12 months after balance date, subject to the relevant regulatory approvals and customary terms of sale for such assets. Life Insurance Liabilities continue to be measured in accordance with AASB 1038. The Group is largely insulated from significant changes to the carrying value of the liability due to the share sale agreements. Our estimates of life insurance liabilities are affected by: regulation, competition, interest rates, inflation, taxes and general economic conditions. We have performed sensitivity analysis on key variables influencing the insurance liabilities and assets - namely: interest, inflation, mortality, morbidity and discontinuance risk. We have determined that there would be no material impact to the Group for a reasonable change in any of these variables after taking into account of the share sale agreements. 193 193 ANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 30.

These schemes have corporate trustees, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group. The trustees are the legal owners of the assets, which are held separately from the assets of the Group, and are responsible for setting investment policy and agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the triennial actuarial valuation process. The Group has defined benefit arrangements in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Philippines, Taiwan and United Kingdom. The defined benefit section of the ANZ Australian Staff Superannuation Scheme, the ANZ UK Staff Pension Scheme and the ANZ National Retirement Scheme in New Zealand are the three largest plans. They have been closed to new members since 1987, 2004 and 1991 respectively. None of the schemes had a material deficit, or surplus, at the last funding valuation. The Group has no present liability under any of the schemes’ trust deeds to fund a deficit (measured on a funding basis).

In each reporting period, the movements in the net defined benefit liability are recognised as follows: the net movement relating to the current period’s service cost, net interest on the defined benefit liability, past service costs and other costs (such as the effects of any curtailments and settlements) as operating expenses; remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (which comprise actuarial gains and losses and return on scheme assets, excluding interest income included in net interest) directly in retained earnings through other comprehensive income; and contributions of the Group directly against the net defined benefit position.",

Each option/right entitles the holder to one ordinary share subject to the terms and conditions imposed on grant. Exercise price of options, determined in accordance with the rules of the plan, is generally based on the VWAP of the shares traded on the ASX in the week leading up to and including the date of grant. For rights, the exercise price is nil.",
    "Prior to the exercise of the option/right if ANZ changes its share capital due to a bonus share issue, pro-rata new share issue or reorganisation the following adjustments are required: Issue of bonus shares - When the holder exercises their option, they are also entitled to be issued the number of bonus shares they would have been entitled to had they held the underlying shares at the time of the bonus issue; Pro-rata share offer - We will adjust the exercise price of the option in the manner set out in the ASX Listing Rules; and Reorganisation - In respect of rights, if there is a bonus issue or reorganisation of ANZ’s share capital, then the Board may adjust the number of rights or the number of underlying shares so that there is no advantage or disadvantage to the holder. Holders otherwise have no other entitlements to participate: in any new issue of ANZ securities before they exercise their options/rights; or in a share issue of a body corporate other than ANZ (such as a subsidiary).

Expected volatility represents a measure of the amount by which ANZ’s share price is expected to fluctuate over the life of the rights.

    "The aggregate of deposits of KMP and their related parties with the Group were $60 million (2018: $56 million). Other transactions with KMP and their related parties included amounts paid to the Group in respect of insurance premiums, investment management service fees, brokerage and bank fees and charges. The Group has reimbursed KMP for the costs incurred for secretarial services associated with the performance of their duties. These transactions are conducted on normal commercial terms and conditions no more favourable than those given to other employees or customers. In November 2010, a subsidiary of ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited (ANZ NZ) purchased a residential property in New Zealand for NZ$7.55 million. The property was leased to the then ANZ NZ Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mr David Hisco, as part of a relocation package arrangement. On 31 March 2017, the property was sold to Mr David Hisco’s wife for NZ$6.9 million. At that time, Mr Hisco was the CEO of ANZ NZ and a member of Key Management Personnel. ANZ NZ obtained two independent valuations of the property, one of which was not considered for a number of reasons, including that it did not comply with valuation standards. ANZ NZ then obtained a further independent valuation and the sale price was determined as the midpoint of these two independent valuations, less an amount reflecting part of the estimated sale costs that would have otherwise been incurred. Consistent with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s requirements on ANZ NZ concerning independence, the sale of the property was overseen by ANZ NZ. This transaction was not separately disclosed in the Group’s or ANZ NZ’s 2017 financial statements. ASIC made enquiries of ANZ concerning disclosure of this matter in the 2017 financial statements. ANZ also acknowledges the determination of the Financial Markets Authority (New Zealand) that ANZ NZ should have disclosed the March 2017 sale as a related party transaction in its 2017 financial statements.",

Many of these facilities are expected to be only partially used, and others may never be used at all. As such, the total of the nominal principal amounts is not necessarily representative of future liquidity risks or future cash requirements. Based on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay, the total undrawn facilities of 209,341 million (2018: $202,531 million) mature within 12 months. GUARANTEES, LETTERS OF CREDIT AND PERFORMANCE RELATED CONTINGENCIES Guarantees, letters of credit and performance related contingencies relate to transactions that the Group has entered into as principal – including: guarantees, standby letters of credit and documentary letters of credit. Documentary letters of credit involve the Group issuing letters of credit guaranteeing payment in favour of an exporter. They are secured against an underlying shipment of goods or backed by a confirmatory letter of credit from another bank. Performance related contingencies are liabilities that oblige the Group to make payments to a third party if the customer fails to fulfil its non-monetary obligations under the contract. To reflect the risk associated with these transactions, we apply the same credit origination, portfolio management and collateral requirements that we apply to loans. The contract amount represents the maximum potential amount that we could lose if the counterparty fails to meet its financial obligations. As the facilities may expire without being drawn upon, the notional amounts do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements. Based on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay, the total guarantees and letters of credit of $22,339 million (2018: $18,441 million) and total performance related contingencies of $22,112 million (2018: $24,136 million) mature within 12 months.",

COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS (continued) OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES As at 30 September 2019, the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of the matters outlined below. Where relevant, expert legal advice has been obtained and, in the light of such advice, provisions (refer to note 21) and/or disclosures as deemed appropriate have been made. In some instances we have not disclosed the estimated financial impact of the individual items either because it is not practicable to do so or because such disclosure may prejudice the interests of the Group. REGULATORY AND CUSTOMER EXPOSURES In recent years there has been an increase in the number of matters on which the Group engages with its regulators. There have also been significant increases in the nature and scale of regulatory investigations and reviews, civil and criminal enforcement actions (whether by court action or otherwise), formal and informal inquiries, regulatory supervisory activities and the quantum of fines issued by regulators, particularly against financial institutions both in Australia and globally. The Group has received various notices and requests for information from its regulators as part of both industry-wide and Group-specific reviews and has also made disclosures to its regulators at its own instigation. The nature of these interactions can be wide ranging and, for example, currently include a range of matters including responsible lending practices, product suitability and distribution, interest and fees and the entitlement to charge them, customer remediation, wealth advice, insurance distribution, pricing, competition, conduct in financial markets and financial transactions, capital market transactions, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations, reporting and disclosure obligations and product disclosure documentation. There may be exposures to customers which are additional to any regulatory exposures. These could include class actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities. The outcomes and total costs associated with such reviews and possible exposures remain uncertain. BANK FEES LITIGATION AND PERIODICAL PAYMENT REMEDIATION AND ASIC ACTION A litigation funder commenced a class action against the Company in 2010, followed by a second similar class action in March 2013. The applicants contended that certain exception fees (honour, dishonour and non-payment fees on transaction accounts and late payment and over-limit fees on credit cards) were unenforceable penalties and that various of the fees were also unenforceable under statutory provisions governing unconscionable conduct, unfair contract terms and unjust transactions. The claims in the March 2013 class action failed and have been dismissed. The original claims in the 2010 class action have been dismissed. In 2017, a new claim was added to the 2010 class action, in relation to the Company’s entitlement to charge certain periodical payment non-payment fees. Part of the class of customers had already received remediation payments from the Company. An agreement to settle the claim was reached in December 2018. The settlement is subject to court approval. In July 2019, ASIC commenced civil penalty proceedings against the Company in relation to the charging of fees for periodical payments in certain circumstances between August 2003 and February 2016. ASIC seeks civil penalties in respect of alleged false or misleading representations and unconscionable conduct. ASIC also alleges that the Company engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct and breached certain statutory obligations as a financial services licensee. The matter is at an early stage. The outcomes and total costs remain uncertain. The Company is defending the allegations. BENCHMARK/RATE ACTIONS In July and August 2016, class action complaints were brought in the United States District Court against local and international banks, including the Company – one action relating to the bank bill swap rate (BBSW), and one action relating to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR) and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate (SOR). The class actions are expressed to apply to persons and entities that engaged in US-based transactions in financial instruments that were priced, benchmarked, and/or settled based on BBSW or SIBOR. The claimants seek damages or compensation in amounts not specified, and allege that the defendant banks, including the Company, violated US anti-trust laws and (in the BBSW case only) anti-racketeering laws, the Commodity Exchange Act, and unjust enrichment principles. The Company is defending the proceedings. The matters are at an early stage. In February 2017, the South African Competition Commission commenced proceedings against local and international banks including the Company alleging breaches of the cartel provisions of the South African Competition Act in respect of trading in the South African rand. The potential civil penalty or other financial impact is uncertain. The matter is at an early stage. CAPITAL RAISING ACTIONS In June 2018, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions commenced criminal proceedings against the Company and a senior employee alleging that they were knowingly concerned in cartel conduct by the joint lead managers of the Company’s August 2015 underwritten institutional equity placement of approximately 80.8 million ordinary shares. The matter is at an early stage. The Company and its senior employee are defending the allegations. In September 2018, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) commenced civil penalty proceedings against the Company alleging failure to comply with continuous disclosure obligations in connection with the Company’s August 2015 underwritten institutional equity placement. ASIC alleges the Company should have advised the market that the joint lead managers took up approximately 25.5 million ordinary shares of the placement. The matter is at an early stage. The Company is defending the allegations. FRANCHISEE LITIGATION In February 2018, two related class actions were brought against the Company alleging breaches of contract and unconscionable conduct in relation to lending to 7-Eleven franchisees. An agreement to settle the claims against the Company was reached in March 2019. The settlement is subject to court approval. 203 203 ANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 33.

    "SECURITY RECOVERY ACTIONS Various claims have been made or are anticipated, arising from security recovery actions taken to resolve impaired assets. These claims will be defended. WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES The Group has provided warranties, indemnities and other commitments in favour of the purchaser and other persons in connection with various disposals of businesses and assets and other transactions, covering a range of matters and risks. It is exposed to potential claims under those warranties, indemnities and commitments. CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS Certain group companies have a commitment to comply with rules governing various clearing and settlement arrangements which could result in a credit risk exposure and loss if another member institution fails to settle its payment clearing activities. The Group’s potential exposure arising from these arrangements is unquantifiable in advance. Certain group companies hold memberships of central clearing houses, including ASX Clear (Futures), London Clearing House (LCH) SwapClear and RepoClear, Korea Exchange (KRX), Hong Kong Exchange (HKEX), Clearing Corporation of India and the Shanghai Clearing House. These memberships allow the relevant group company to centrally clear derivative instruments in line with cross-border regulatory requirements. Common to all of these memberships is the requirement for the relevant group company to make default fund contributions. In the event of a default by another member, the relevant group company could potentially be required to commit additional default fund contributions which are unquantifiable in advance. PARENT ENTITY GUARANTEES The Company has issued letters of comfort and guarantees in respect of certain subsidiaries in the normal course of business. Under these letters and guarantees, the Company undertakes to ensure that those subsidiaries continue to meet their financial obligations, subject to certain conditions including that the entity remains a controlled entity of the Company. SALE OF GRINDLAYS BUSINESSES On 31 July 2000, the Company completed the sale to Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) of ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited and the private banking business of ANZ in the United Kingdom and Jersey, together with ANZ Grindlays (Jersey) Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries, for USD1.3 billion in cash. The Company provided warranties and certain indemnities relating to those businesses and, where it was anticipated that payments would be likely under the warranties or indemnities, made provisions to cover the anticipated liabilities. The issue below has not adversely impacted the reported results. All settlements and penalties to date have been covered within existing provisions. In 1991 certain amounts were transferred from non-convertible Indian Rupee accounts maintained with Grindlays in India. These transactions may not have complied with the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973. Grindlays, on its own initiative, brought these transactions to the attention of the Reserve Bank of India. The Indian authorities served notices on Grindlays and certain of its officers in India and civil penalties have been imposed which are the subject of appeals. Criminal prosecutions are pending and will be defended. The amounts in issue are not material. CONTINGENT ASSETS NATIONAL HOUSING BANK The Company is pursuing recovery of the proceeds of certain disputed cheques which were credited to the account of a former Grindlays customer in the early 1990s. The disputed cheques were drawn on the National Housing Bank (NHB) in India. Proceedings between Grindlays and NHB concerning the proceeds of the cheques were resolved in early 2002. Recovery is now being pursued from the estate of the Grindlays customer who received the cheque proceeds. Any amounts recovered are to be shared between the Company and NHB. 204 204",

The Group adopted AASB 15 in this reporting period with comparatives restated. The impact of this policy change on the reported 30 September 2018 balance sheet was an increase in Other assets of $32 million, an increase in Deferred tax liabilities of $10 million and an increase in Retained earnings of $22 million, reflecting revenue that qualifies for upfront recognition under AASB 15 but was not previously recognised under AASB 118. 3. Upon adoption of AASB 15, certain liabilities associated with credit card loyalty programs have been reclassified from Other provisions to Payables and other liabilities. In addition to the balance sheet impact above, upon adoption of AASB 15 certain items previously netted are now presented gross in operating income and operating expenses. This increased total operating income and total operating expenses by $128 million for the 2019 financial year.

    "1. On initial application of AASB 9, a portfolio of bonds with a fair value of $1,000 million was transferred from Trading securities to Investment securities - debt securities at FVOCI as the applicable business model was held to collect and sell. Cumulative fair value gains/(losses) on this portfolio of $2 million (after tax) were transferred from Retained earnings to the FVOCI reserve. Additionally, the reclassification resulted in a reduction in deferred tax assets and current tax liabilities of $1 million. The Available-for-sale classification is no longer applicable under AASB 9. Accordingly, on transition: $69,938 million of Available-for-sale debt instruments were reclassified to Investment securities – debt securities at FVOCI due to the business model being held to collect and sell. There was no re-measurement impact associated with this reclassification; $3,252 million of Available-for-sale debt instruments were reclassified to Investment securities – debt securities at amortised cost due to the business model being held to collect at 1 October 2018. This reclassification resulted in re-measurement of a $2 million increase to the carrying amount arising from reversal of the previous available-for-sale revaluation reserve. Additionally, a deferred tax asset of $1 million associated with the previous available-for-sale revaluation was reversed; the Group made irrevocable elections to designate $1,087 million of non-traded Available-for-sale equity securities as Investment securities - equity securities at FVOCI; and $7 million of Available-for-sale equity securities were reclassified to Trading securities and the related reserve balance of $1 million was reclassified to Retained earnings. 3. Certain loans with contractual cash flow characteristics that are not solely payments of principal and interest were reclassified from Net loans and advances at amortised cost to Net Loans and advances at FVTPL. The loans had an amortised cost carrying amount of $224 million and a fair value of $201 million at 30 September 2018. The associated re-measurement of $23 million was recognised in Retained earnings offset by a decrease in current tax liabilities of $7 million. In addition, one of the loans was previously in a fair value hedge relationship which was discontinued effective 1 October 2018. Accordingly, changes in the fair value due to changes in the hedged risk which were previously recognised as a reduction to the carrying value of the loan amounting to $15 million were written back to Retained earnings offset by an increase in current tax liabilities of $4 million. 4. The Group elected to designate certain financial liabilities (bonds included within Debt issuances) as measured at FVTPL effective from 1 October 2018 to reduce an accounting mismatch. The bonds had an amortised cost carrying amount of $879 million and a fair value of $824 million at 30 September 2018. The difference of $55 million (comprising a $109 million decrease in fair value before own credit, offset by a $54 million increase in fair value attributable to own credit) offset by a net tax impact of $17 million (increase in deferred tax asset of $17 million and an increase in current tax liability of $34 million) was recognised in Retained earnings. 5. The Group recognised a decrease of $65 million to the carrying value of Investments in associates with a corresponding decrease to Retained earnings reflecting the Group’s share of the estimated initial application impact of IFRS 9 (the international equivalent of AASB 9). 6. The initial application of the expected credit loss requirements of AASB 9, resulted in increases in allowances for credit impairment attributable to the following: On-balance sheet loans and advances of $647 million reflected in Net loans and advances at amortised cost; Debt securities measured at amortised cost of $11 million reflected in Investment securities – debt securities at amortised cost; and Off-balance sheet credit related commitments of $155 million reflected in Other provisions. The total impact of $813 million was recognised as a reduction to Retained earnings, offset by an increase of $234 million related to deferred tax. Additionally, loss allowances of $10 million (after-tax) attributable to Investment Securities – debt securities at FVOCI have been recognised in Reserves with a corresponding adjustment to Retained earnings. The debt securities remain at fair value on the face of the Balance Sheet. 7. On initial application of AASB 9, a portfolio of Negotiable Certificates of Deposit with a carrying amount of $2,906 million was reclassified from Net loans and advances at amortised cost to Investment Securities – debt securities at amortised cost. There was no re-measurement impact associated with this reclassification. 8. On initial application of AASB 9, loans with a carrying amount and fair value of $1,340 million that were in the process of being syndicated were reclassified from Net loans and advances at amortised cost to Net Loans and advances at FVTPL on the basis that the applicable business model is held-to-sell. There was no re-measurement impact associated with this reclassification. 208 208",
    "36. EVENTS SINCE THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR On 17 October the Group announced it had agreed a revised price for the sale of its OnePath P&I business and ADGs to IOOF of $850 million, being a $125 million reduction from the original sale price of $975 million announced in October 2017. The new price of $850 million includes approximately $25 million that ANZ has already received for the sale of ADGs in October 2018. The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements. Subject to APRA approval, the Group expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. The impact of the reduction in price has been reflected in the 2019 financial results. Other than the matter above, there have been no significant events from 30 September 2019 to the date of signing this report. 209 209 210 CONSOLIDATED GROUP DIRECTORS’ DECLARATION Directors’ Declaration The Directors of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited declare that: a) in the Directors’ opinion, the financial statements and notes of the Consolidated Entity are in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including: i) section 296, that they comply with the Australian Accounting Standards and any further requirements of the Corporations Regulations 2001; and ii) section 297, that they give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Consolidated Entity as at 30 September 2019 and of its performance for the year ended on that date; b) the notes to the financial statements of the Consolidated Entity include a statement that the financial statements and notes of the Consolidated Entity comply with International Financial Reporting Standards; c) the Directors have been given the declarations required by section 295A of the Corporations Act 2001; and d) in the Directors’ opinion, there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Company will be able to pay its debts as and when they become due and payable.

    "We have audited the Financial Report of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (the Company) and the entities it controlled at the year end and from time to time during the financial year (together, the Group). In our opinion, the accompanying Financial Report of the Group is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including: giving a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position as at 30 September 2019 and of its financial performance for the year ended on that date; and complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001.

    "We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the Financial Report in Australia. We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.",
    "The Key Audit Matters we identified are: Allowance for expected credit losses; Valuation of Financial Instruments held at Fair Value; Provisions for Customer Remediation; Accounting for Divestments; and IT Systems and Controls. Key Audit Matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Report of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 211 211 ANZ 2018 ANNUAL REPORT INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (continued) KEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued) ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES ($4,190M) Refer to the critical accounting estimates and judgements disclosures in relation to the allowance for expected credit losses in Note 13 to the Financial Report. The Key Audit Matter AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9) was adopted by the Group on 1 October 2018. This is a key audit matter due to the significance of the loans and advances balance to the financial statements and the inherent complexity of the Group’s Expected Credit Loss (ECL) models (ECL models) used to measure ECL allowances. This new and complex accounting standard requires the Group to recognise ECLs on its loans and advances and off-balance sheet positions; the Group developed new models which are reliant on data as well as a number of estimates including the impact of multiple economic scenarios and other assumptions such as defining a significant increase in credit risk (SICR). This involves significant judgement and estimates and takes into account forward looking information reflecting potential future economic events. AASB 9 requires the Group to measure ECLs on a forward-looking basis reflecting a range of future economic conditions, including key forward- looking assumptions such as forecast GDP and unemployment levels. Post-model adjustments to the ECL results are also made by the Group to address known ECL model limitations or emerging trends in the loan portfolios. We exercise significant judgement in challenging the economic scenarios used and the judgemental overlays the Group applied to the ECL results. The criteria selected to identify a SICR, such as a decrease in customer credit rating (CCR), are key areas of judgement within the Group’s ECL methodology as these criteria determine if a forward-looking 12 month or lifetime allowance is recorded. Separate from the ECL calculation, allowances for individually assessed loans exceeding specific thresholds are individually assessed by the Group. These specific allowances are established based on the expected future cash repayments and estimated proceeds from the value of the collateral held by the Group in respect of the loans. How the matter was addressed in our audit Our audit procedures for the allowance for ECL and disclosures for the year ended 30 September 2019 included assessing the Group’s significant accounting policies against the requirements of the accounting standard. Additionally our procedures covered: We tested key controls in relation to: The Group’s ECL model governance and validation processes; The Group’s assessment and approval of the forward looking macroeconomic assumptions and scenario weightings through challenge applied by the Group’s internal governance processes; and Reconciliation of the data used in the ECL calculation process to gross balances recorded within the general ledger as well as source systems. Testing the key controls over counterparty risk grading for wholesale loans (larger customer exposures are monitored individually). We tested the approval of new lending facilities against the Group’s lending policies, and controls over the monitoring of counterparty credit quality. This included testing controls over the identification of exposures showing signs of stress, either due to internal factors specific to the counterparty or external macroeconomic factors, and testing the timeliness of and the accuracy of counterparty risk assessments and risk grading against the requirements of the Group’s lending policies and regulatory requirements; and For retail loans, testing controls over the systems which record lending arrears, group exposures into delinquency buckets, and re-calculate individual allowances. We tested automated calculation and change management controls and evaluated the Group’s oversight of the portfolios, with a focus on controls over delinquency monitoring. We tested a sample of the level of allowances held against different loan products based on the delinquency profile and challenged assumptions made in respect of expected recoveries, including from collateral held. We also tested relevant General Information Technology Controls (GITCs) over the key IT applications used by the Group in measuring ECL allowances as detailed in the IT Systems and Controls key audit matter below. In addition to controls testing, our procedures included: Performing credit assessments of a sample of wholesale loans controlled by the Group’s specialist workout and recovery team assessed as higher risk or impaired, and a sample of other loans, focusing on larger exposures assessed by the Group as showing signs of deterioration, or in areas of emerging risk (assessed against external market conditions). We challenged the Group’s risk grading of the loan, assessment of loan recoverability, valuation of security and the impact on the credit allowance. To do this, we used the information on the Group’s loan file, understood the facts and circumstances of the case with the loan officer, and performed our own assessment of recoverability. Exercising our judgement, our procedures included using our understanding of relevant industries and the macroeconomic environment and comparing data and assumptions used by the Group in recoverability assessments to externally sourced evidence, such as commodity prices, publicly available audited financial statements and comparable external valuations of collateral held. Where relevant we assessed the forecast timing of future cash flows in the context of supporting valuations and approved business plans and challenged key assumptions implicit in the valuations; Obtaining an understanding of the Group’s processes to determine ECL allowances, evaluating the Group’s ECL model methodologies against established market practices and criteria in the accounting standards; 212 212",
    "KEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued) Working with KPMG Risk Consulting specialists, we assessed the accuracy of the Group’s ECL model predictions by re-performing, for a sample of loans, the ECL allowance and comparing this to the amount recorded by the Group; Working with KPMG Economic specialists, we challenged the Group’s forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions and scenarios incorporated in the Group’s ECL models. We compared the Group’s forecast GDP and unemployment rates to relevant publicly available macro-economic information, and considered other known variables and information obtained through our other audit procedures to identify contradictory indicators; Testing the implementation of the Group’s SICR methodology by re-performing the staging calculation for a sample of loans and comparing our expectation to actual staging applied on an individual account level, taking into consideration movements in CCR; and Assessing the accuracy of the data used in the ECL models by confirming a sample of data fields such as account balance and CCR to relevant source systems. We also challenged key assumptions in the components of the Group’s post-model adjustments to the ECL allowance balance. This included: Evaluating underlying data used in concentration risk and economic cycle allowances by comparing underlying portfolio characteristics to recent loss experience, current market conditions and specific risks inherent in the Group’s loan portfolios; Assessing the requirement for other additional allowances considering the Group’s ECL model and data deficiencies identified by the Group’s ECL model validation processes, and Assessing the completeness of additional allowance overlays by checking the consistency of risks we identified in the portfolios against the Group’s assessment. AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Assessing the appropriateness of the Group’s disclosures in the financial report using our understanding obtained from our testing against the requirements of the accounting standard. VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD AT FAIR VALUE: - ASSETS HELD AT FAIR VALUE $243,888M - LIABILITIES HELD AT FAIR VALUE $130,346M Refer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures of fair values in Note 17 to the Financial Report. The Key Audit Matter Financial instruments held at fair value on the Group’s balance sheet include investment securities, trading securities, derivative assets and liabilities, certain debt securities, and other assets and liabilities designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income. The instruments are mainly risk management products sold to customers and used by the Group to manage its own interest rate and foreign exchange risk. The valuation of financial instruments held at fair value is considered a Key Audit Matter as: Financial instruments held at fair value are significant (25% of assets and 14% of liabilities); The significant volume and range of products transacted, in a number of international locations, increases the risk of inconsistencies in transaction management processes that could lead to inaccurate valuation; Determining the fair value of trading securities and derivatives involves a significant level of judgement by the Group, increasing the risk of error, and adding complexity to our audit. The level of judgement increases where internal models, as opposed to quoted market prices, are used to determine fair value of an instrument, or where inputs to the internal models, such as discount rates and measures of volatility, are not observable; or where there are a greater number of variables, including trade economic details and modelling assumptions, which feed into the internal models; and The valuation of certain derivatives held by the Group is sensitive to inputs including funding rates, probabilities of default loss given default. Both funding and credit risk are incorporated within the valuation of certain derivative instruments. This increased our audit effort in this area and necessitated the involvement of valuation specialists. How the matter was addressed in our audit Our audit procedures for the valuation of financial instruments held at fair value included: Testing access rights and change management controls for key valuation systems; Testing interface controls, notably the completeness and accuracy of data transfers between transaction processing systems, key systems used to generate valuations and any related valuation adjustments, and the Group’s market risk management and finance systems to identify inconsistencies in transaction management and valuation processes across products and locations; Testing the governance and approval controls, such as management review and approval of the valuation models, and approval of new products against policies and procedures; 213 213 ANZ 2018 ANNUAL REPORT INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (continued) KEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued)",
    "Group’s independent markets and treasury control; Testing the management review and approval of model construction and validation, aimed at assessing the validity and robustness of underlying valuation models; and Testing the Group’s data validation controls, such as those over key inputs in generating the fair value to market data where fair values were determined by front office teams. We carried out testing over the valuation of financial instruments with both observable and unobservable inputs. Our specific testing involved valuation specialists and included: Re-performing the valuation of ‘level 1’ and ‘level 2’ investment securities and trading securities, which are primarily government, semi- government and corporate debt securities, by comparing the observable inputs, including quoted prices, to independently sourced market data; Using independent models, re-calculating the valuation of a sample, across locations, of derivative assets and liabilities where the fair value was determined using observable inputs. This included comparing a sample of observable inputs used in the Group’s derivative valuations to independently-sourced market data, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and volatilities; Where the fair value of derivatives and other financial assets and liabilities were determined using unobservable inputs (‘level 3’ instruments), challenging the Group’s valuation model by testing the key inputs used to comparable data in the market, including the use of proxy instruments and available alternatives. We compared the Group’s valuation methodology to industry practice and the criteria in the accounting standards; and Evaluating the appropriateness of the Group’s valuation methodology for derivative financial instruments, having regard to current and emerging derivative valuation practices across a range of peer institutions, and against the required criteria in the accounting standards. We tested adjustments made to valuations, particularly funding and credit valuation adjustments on un-collateralised derivatives. In particular, for a sample of individual counterparties, across locations, we tested key inputs to the credit valuation adjustment calculation, including the probability of default, against observable market data. Where proxies were used, we assessed the proxy against available alternatives, across a number of locations. PROVISION FOR CUSTOMER REMEDIATION ($1,139M) Refer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures in Notes 21 and 33 to the Financial Report. The Key Audit Matter The Group has assessed the need to recognise provisions in relation to certain customer remediation activities arising from both internal and external investigations, and reviews. This includes provisions for expected refunds to customers, remediation project costs and related customer and regulatory claims, penalties, and litigation outcomes. The provision for customer remediation activities is a Key Audit Matter due to the number of investigations, the quantum of amounts involved, and the judgements required by us in assessing the Group’s determination of: The existence of a present legal or constructive obligation arising from a past event using the conditions of the event against the criteria in the accounting standards; Reliable estimates of the amounts which may be paid arising from investigations, including estimates of related costs and regulatory penalties; and The potential for legal proceedings, further investigations, and reviews from its regulators leading to a wider range of estimation outcomes for us to consider. How the matter was addressed in our audit Our audit procedures for customer remediation provisions included: Obtaining an understanding of the Group’s processes for identifying and assessing the potential impact of the investigations into customer remediation payments, related project costs and legal proceedings associated with compliance matters, investigations and reviews from its regulators; Enquiring with the Group regarding ongoing legal, and regulatory matters, and investigation into other remediation activities; Enquiring with external legal counsel; Reading the minutes and other relevant documentation of the Group’s Board of Directors, Board Committees, various management committees, and attending the Group’s Audit and Risk Committee meetings; Inspecting correspondence with relevant regulatory bodies; For a sample of individual exposures, assessing the basis for recognition and measurement of a provision and associated costs against the requirements of the accounting standards. We did this by understanding and challenging the provisioning methodologies and underlying assumptions; 214 214",
    "KEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued) Testing completeness by evaluating where exposures may have arisen based upon our knowledge and experience of broader industry matters, the Group's documentation and the current regulatory environment. We also checked these features of these exposures against the criteria defining a provision or a contingency in the accounting standards; Assessing the appropriateness of the Group’s conclusions against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards where estimates were unable to be reliably made for a provision to be recognised; and Evaluating the related disclosures against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.",
    "Refer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures in Notes 1 and 29 to the Financial Report. The Key Audit Matter On 17 October 2017, the Group announced the sale of its OnePath Pensions and Investments (OnePath P&I) business and Aligned Dealer Groups (ADGs) business to IOOF Holdings Limited (IOOF). The sale of the ADGs business completed on 1 October 2018. On 17 October 2019, the Group announced it had revised its contract terms with IOOF and, subject to APRA approval, the Group expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. On 12 December 2017, the Group announced the sale of its Life Insurance business to Zurich Financial Services Australia Limited (together, the Divestment Businesses). The transaction completed on 31 May 2019 and final adjustments to sale proceeds are subject to finalization of a post completion net asset review. These businesses were part of the Wealth Australia operating segment. The financial results of the Divestment Businesses are presented as discontinued operations, and the associated assets and liabilities of OnePath P&I continues to be classified as held for sale at balance date. The divestments are considered a Key Audit Matter due to the: significance of the Divestment Businesses to the Group; judgement applied by the Group in the measurement of the Divestment Businesses using the requirements accounting standards and the terms and conditions of the divestments; judgement is applied by the Group when assessing events that occur after the reporting date but before the financial statements are authorized for issue; and judgement applied by the Group in assessing the probability of the divestments against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards at 30 September 2019. We focused on the areas where judgement exists in the measurement of the discontinued operations, including the: allocation of goodwill between the Divestment Businesses; estimation of costs required to complete the divestments including costs associated with separating these businesses from the Group; subsequent re-measurement adjustments of the Divestment Businesses; consideration of adjusting and non-adjusting subsequent events relating to the Divestment Businesses; and taxation implications of the divestments, potentially having a significant impact on the loss on sale and requiring specialist knowledge. How the matter was addressed in our audit Our audit procedures in relation to the Divestment Businesses included: Reading the relevant transaction documents to understand the terms and conditions of the divestments; Assessing the criteria for the Divestment Businesses to be recognised and measured as held for sale against the criteria in the accounting standards at balance sheet date; Evaluating the substance of the divestments using the terms and conditions of the transaction documents against the criteria for discontinued operations in the accounting standards; Evaluating the Group’s controls for measurement of the divestments held for sale. This included the Steering Committee review and approval of costs associated with separating the divestments from the Group; Assessing, on a sample basis, the identification of assets and liabilities disposed by comparing to transaction documents and underlying financial records at balance date; Checking the consideration for the divestments to the transaction documents and underlying financial records; Assessing the identification, basis for recognition, and treatment of a sample of costs associated with separating the divestments from the Group for compliance with the accounting standards; Comparing the quantum of the costs associated with separating the divestments from the Group to similar transactions within the market; Using our tax specialists, we evaluated the associated tax implications against the requirements of the tax legislation; Evaluating the methodology applied by the Group to allocate goodwill between the Divestment Businesses based on our knowledge of the businesses and the requirements of the accounting standards; 215 215 ANZ 2018 ANNUAL REPORT INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (continued) KEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued) Checking the Group’s calculations of loss on sale of each of the divestments and any subsequent re-measurement adjustments; Assessing events that occur after the reporting date but before the financial statements were authorised for issue; and Assessing the disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of the accounting standards.",
    "The Key Audit Matter As a major Australian bank, the group’s businesses utilise a large number of complex, interdependent Information Technology (IT) systems to process and record a high volume of transactions. Controls over access and changes to IT systems are critical to the recording of financial information and the preparation of a financial report which provides a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position and performance. The IT systems and controls, as they impact the financial recording and reporting of transactions, is a key audit matter and our audit approach could significantly differ depending on the effective operation of the Group’s IT controls. KPMG IT specialists were used throughout the engagement as a core part of our audit team. How the matter was addressed in our audit We tested the technology control environment for key IT applications (systems) used in processing significant transactions and recording balances in the general ledger. We also tested automated controls embedded within these systems which support the effective operation of technology-enabled business processes. Our audit procedures included: Assessing the governance and higher-level controls in place across the IT Environment, including the approach to Group policy design, review and awareness, and IT Risk Management practices. Design and operating effectiveness testing of controls across the User Access Management Lifecycle, including how users are on-boarded, reviewed, and removed on a timely basis from critical IT applications and supporting infrastructure. We also looked at how privileged roles and functions are managed across each IT Application and the supporting infrastructure. Design and operating effectiveness testing of controls in place to enable Change Management including how changes are initiated, documented, approved, tested and authorised prior to migration into the production environment of critical IT Applications. We also assessed the appropriateness of users with access to make changes to IT applications across the Group.

    "Other Information is both financial and non-financial information in Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited’s annual reporting which is provided in addition to the Financial Report and the Auditor's Report. The Directors are responsible for the Other Information. Our opinion on the Financial Report does not cover the Other Information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of the Remuneration Report and our related assurance opinion. In connection with our audit of the Financial Report, our responsibility is to read the Other Information. In doing so, we consider whether the Other Information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. We are required to report if we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this Other Information, and based on the work we have performed on the Other Information that we obtained prior to the date of this Auditor’s Report, we have nothing to report.",
    "The Directors are responsible for: preparing a Financial Report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001; implementing necessary internal control to enable the preparation of a Financial Report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and whether the use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the Financial Report.

    "AASs – Australian Accounting Standards. AASB – Australian Accounting Standards Board. The term “AASB” is commonly used when identifying AASs issued by the AASB. In doing so, the term is used together with the AAS number. ADI – Authorised Deposit-taking Institution. APRA – Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. APS – ADI Prudential Standard. BCBS – Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Cash and cash equivalents comprise coins, notes, money at call, balances held with central banks, liquid settlement balances (readily convertible to known amounts of cash which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value) and securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repos) in less than three months. Cash profit is an additional measure of profit which is prepared on a basis other than in accordance with accounting standards. Cash profit represents ANZ’s preferred measure of the result of the core business activities of the Group, enabling readers to assess Group and Divisional performance against prior periods and against peer institutions. To calculate cash profit, the Group excludes non- core items from statutory profit as noted below. These items are calculated consistently period on period so as not to discriminate between positive and negative adjustments. Gains and losses are adjusted where they are significant, or have the potential to be significant in any one period, and fall into one of three categories: 1. gains or losses included in earnings arising from changes in tax, legal or accounting legislation or other non-core items not associated with the ongoing operations of the Group; 2. treasury shares, revaluation of policy liabilities, economic hedging impacts and similar accounting items that represent timing differences that will reverse through earnings in the future; and 3. accounting reclassifications between individual line items that do not impact reported results, such as policyholders tax gross up. Cash profit is not a measure of cash flow or profit determined on a cash accounting basis. Collectively assessed provision under AASB 139 is the provision for credit losses that are inherent in the portfolio but not able to be individually identified. A collectively assessed provision may only be recognised when a loss event has already occurred. Losses expected as a result of future events, no matter how likely, are not recognised. Collectively assessed allowance for expected credit loss under AASB 9 represent the Expected Credit Loss (ECL). This incorporates forward looking information and does not require an actual loss event to have occurred for an impairment provision to be recognised. Covered bonds are bonds issued by an ADI to external investors secured against a pool of the ADI’s assets (the cover pool) assigned to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. The primary assets forming the cover pool are mortgage loans. The mortgages remain on the issuer’s balance sheet. The covered bond holders have dual recourse to the issuer and the cover pool assets. The mortgages included in the cover pool cannot be otherwise pledged or disposed of but may be repurchased and substituted in order to maintain the credit quality of the pool. The Group issues covered bonds as part of its funding activities. Credit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from the failure of ANZ’s customers and counterparties to honour or perform fully the terms of a loan or contract. Credit risk weighted assets (CRWA) represent assets which are weighted for credit risk according to a set formula as prescribed in APS 112/113. Customer deposits represent term deposits, other deposits bearing interest, deposits not bearing interest and borrowing corporations’ debt excluding securitisation deposits. Customer remediation includes provisions for expected refunds to customers, remediation project costs and related customer and regulatory claims, penalties and litigation outcomes. Derivative credit valuation adjustment (CVA) – Over the life of a derivative instrument, ANZ uses a model to adjust fair value to take into account the impact of counterparty credit quality. The methodology calculates the present value of expected losses over the life of the financial instrument as a function of probability of default, loss given default, expected credit risk exposure and an asset correlation factor. Impaired derivatives are also subject to a CVA. Dividend payout ratio is the total ordinary dividend payment divided by profit attributable to shareholders of the Company. Fair value is an amount at which an asset or liability could be exchanged between knowledgeable and willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. Group is Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (the Company) and the entities it controlled at the year end and from time to time during the financial year (together, the Group). Gross loans and advances (GLA) is made up of loans and advances, acceptances and capitalised brokerage/mortgage origination fees less unearned income. IFRS – International Financial Reporting Standards. Impaired assets are those financial assets where doubt exists as to whether the full contractual amount will be received in a timely manner, or where concessional terms have been provided because of the financial difficulties of the customer. Financial assets are impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of a loss event that occurred prior to the reporting date, and that loss event has had an impact, which can be reliably estimated, on the expected future cash flows of the individual asset or portfolio of assets. Impaired loans comprise drawn facilities where the customer’s status is defined as impaired. Individually assessed allowance for expected credit losses is assessed on a case-by-case basis for all individually managed impaired assets taking into consideration factors such as the realisable value of security (or other credit mitigants), the likely return available upon liquidation or bankruptcy, legal uncertainties, estimated costs involved in recovery, the market price of the exposure in secondary markets and the amount and timing of expected receipts and recoveries. 227 Glossary (continued) Interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) relates to the potential adverse impact of changes in market interest rates on ANZ’s future net interest income. The risk generally arises from: Net tangible assets equal share capital and reserves attributable to shareholders of the Company less unamortised intangible assets (including goodwill and software). 1. repricing and yield curve risk – the risk to earnings or market value as a result of changes in the overall level of interest rates and/or the relativity of these rates across the yield curve; 2. basis risk – the risk to earnings or market value arising from volatility in the interest margin applicable to banking book items; and 3. optionality risk – the risk to earnings or market value arising from the existence of stand-alone or embedded options in banking book items. Internationally comparable ratios are ANZ’s interpretation of the regulations documented in the Basel Committee publications; “Basel lll: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems” (June 2011) and “International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards” (June 2006). They also include differences identified in APRA’s information paper entitled “International Capital Comparison Study” (13 July 2015). Level 1 in the context of APRA supervision, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited consolidated with certain approved subsidiaries. Regulatory deposits are mandatory reserve deposits lodged with local central banks in accordance with statutory requirements. Restructured items comprise facilities in which the original contractual terms have been modified for reasons related to the financial difficulties of the customer. Restructuring may consist of reduction of interest, principal or other payments legally due, or an extension in maturity materially beyond those typically offered to new facilities with similar risk. Return on average assets is the profit attributable to shareholders of the Company, divided by average total assets. Return on average ordinary shareholders’ equity is the profit attributable to shareholders of the Company, divided by average ordinary shareholders’ equity. Risk weighted assets (RWA) are risk weighted according to each asset’s inherent potential for default and what the likely losses would be in the case of default. In the case of non asset backed risks (i.e. market and operational risk), RWA is determined by multiplying the capital requirements for those risks by 12.5. Level 2 in the context of APRA supervision, the consolidated ANZ Group excluding associates, insurance and funds management entities, commercial non-financial entities and certain securitisation vehicles. Settlement balances owed to/by ANZ represent financial assets and/or liabilities which are in the course of being settled. These may include trade dated assets and liabilities, vostro accounts and securities settlement accounts. Net interest margin is net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets. Net loans and advances represent gross loans and advances less allowance for expected credit losses. Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is the ratio of the amount of available stable funding (ASF) to the amount of required stable funding (RSF) defined by APRA. The amount of ASF is the portion of an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution’s (ADI) capital and liabilities expected to be a reliable source of funds over a one year time horizon. The amount of RSF is a function of the liquidity characteristics and residual maturities of an ADI’s assets and off- balance sheet activities. ADIs must maintain an NSFR of at least 100%. 228 Important dates for shareholders1 APRIL 2020 NOVEMBER 2020 30th April",
