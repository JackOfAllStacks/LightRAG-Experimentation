    "Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ) has a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) and a Bonus Option Plan (BOP) that will operate in respect of the proposed 2019 final dividend. For the 2019 final dividend, ANZ intends to provide shares under the DRP through an on-market purchase and BOP through the issue of new shares. The 'Acquisition Price' to be used in determining the number of shares to be provided under the DRP and BOP will be calculated by reference to the arithmetic average of the daily volume weighted average sale price of all fully paid ANZ ordinary shares sold in the ordinary course of trading on the ASX and Chi-X during the ten trading days commencing on 15 November 2019, and then rounded to the nearest whole cent. Shares provided under the DRP and BOP will rank equally in all respects with existing fully paid ANZ ordinary shares. Election notices from shareholders wanting to commence, cease or vary their participation in the DRP or BOP for the 2019 final dividend must be received by ANZ's Share Registrar by 5.00pm (Australian Eastern Daylight Time) on 13 November 2019. Subject to receiving effective contrary instructions from the shareholder, dividends payable to shareholders with a registered address in the United Kingdom (including the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man) or New Zealand will be converted to Pounds Sterling or New Zealand Dollars respectively at an exchange rate calculated on 15 November 2019.",

    "in earnings arising from changes in tax, legal or accounting legislation or other non-core items not associated with the core operations of the Group; treasury shares, revaluation of policy",

    "ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED",
    "During the September 2019 full year, the Group adopted two new Accounting Standards, AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9) and AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (AASB 15):",
    "AASB 9 - the Group implemented an expected credit loss methodology for impairment of financial assets, and revised the classification and",
    "measurement of certain financial assets from 1 October 2018. Consequently, the Group increased its provision for credit impairment by $813 million through opening retained earnings. Comparative information has not been restated.",
    "AASB 15 - the main impact of adoption is that certain items previously netted are now presented gross in operating income and operating expenses.",
    "Comparative information has been restated which increased total operating income for the September 2018 full year by $153 million and increased total operating expenses by the same amount.",
    "For further details on key requirements and impacts of the changes described above refer to Note 1 and 16 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.",
    "NON-IFRS INFORMATION",
    "Statutory profit is prepared in accordance with recognition and measurement requirements of Australian Accounting Standards, which comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Group provides additional measures of performance in the Consolidated Financial Report & Dividend Announcement which are prepared on a basis other than in accordance with accounting standards. The guidance provided in Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Regulatory Guide 230 has been followed when presenting this information.",
    "Cash Profit",
    "Cash profit, a non-IFRS measure, represents ANZ’s preferred measure of the result of the core business activities of the Group, enabling readers to assess Group and Divisional performance against prior periods and against peer institutions. The adjustments made in arriving at cash profit are included in statutory profit which is subject to audit within the context of the external auditor’s audit of the 2019 ANZ Annual Financial Statements (when released). Cash profit is not subject to audit by the external auditor. The external auditor has informed the Audit Committee that cash profit adjustments have been determined on a consistent basis across each period presented.",
    "Adjustments between statutory profit and cash profit - To calculate cash profit, the Group excludes non-core items from statutory profit. Refer to",
    "pages 77 to 81 for adjustments between statutory and cash profit.",
    "Large/Notable items within cash profit - The Group’s cash profit result from continuing operations includes a number of items collectively referred",
    "to as large/notable items. While these items form part of cash profit, given their nature and significance, they have been presented separately with comparative information, where relevant, to provide transparency and aid comparison. Refer to pages 16 to 20 for details of large/notable items.",
    "DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS",
    "The financial results of the Wealth Australia businesses being divested and associated Group reclassification and consolidation impacts are treated as discontinued operations from a financial reporting perspective. These businesses qualify as discontinued operations, a subset of assets and liabilities held for sale, as they represent a major line of business.",
    "The Group Income Statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income show discontinued operations separately from continuing operations in a separate line item ‘Profit/(Loss) from discontinued operations’.",
    "Sale to IOOF Holdings Limited (IOOF)",
    "On 17 October 2017, the Group announced it had agreed to sell its OnePath pensions and investments (OnePath P&I) business and Aligned Dealer Groups (ADGs) businesses to IOOF. The sale of the ADG business completed on 1 October 2018. On 17 October 2019, the Group announced it had agreed a revised sale price for its OnePath P&I business and ADGs to IOOF of $850 million, being a $125 million reduction from the original sale price of $975 million announced in October 2017. The new price of $850 million includes approximately $25 million that ANZ has already received for the sale of ADGs in October 2018. The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements. Subject to APRA approval, the Group expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. The impact of the reduction in price has been reflected in the 2019 financial results.",
    "Sale to Zurich Financial Services Australia (Zurich)",
    "On 12 December 2017, ANZ announced that it had agreed to sell its life insurance business to Zurich and regulatory approval was obtained on 10 October 2018. The transaction was completed on 31 May 2019.",
    "Included in the ‘Cash loss from discontinued operations’ is:",
    "A $23 million loss ($81 million loss after tax) was recognised in the September 2019 half. This is attributable to sale related adjustments and write- downs, the reversal of the life-to-date cash profit adjustments on the revaluation of policy liabilities sold to Zurich, partially offset by the recycling of gains previously deferred in equity reserves on sale completion. A $632 million loss (pre and post-tax) was recognised on the reclassification of Wealth Australia discontinued operations businesses to held for sale in the September 2018 full year; and",
    "Customer remediation which includes provisions for expected refunds to customers and related remediation costs associated with inappropriate",

    "The methodology for allocating earnings on capital at a business unit level changed from Economic Capital to Regulatory Capital. While neutral at a Group level, this change impacted net interest income at the divisional level;",
    "The residual Asia Retail and Wealth businesses have been transferred from the former Asia Retail and Pacific division to Technology, Services & Operations (TSO) and Group Centre division. The remaining segment has been renamed Pacific division; and",
    "ANZ’s lenders mortgage insurance, share investing, general insurance distribution and financial planning businesses which were previously part of the continuing operations of Wealth Australia now form part of the Australia Retail and Commercial division (previously named Australia division) and Wealth Australia ceases to exist as a continuing division.",

The benefit of imputation credits is recognised, measured at 70% of Australian tax. The cost of capital is a major component of economic profit. At an ANZ Group level, this is calculated using average ordinary shareholders’ equity (excluding non-controlling interests), multiplied by the cost of capital rate (9.0% for the September 2019 half and 10.0% for the March 2019 half with the average of 9.5% being applied to the September 2018 full year for comparative purposes). At a business unit level, capital is allocated based on Regulatory Capital, whereby higher risk businesses attract higher levels of capital. The basis of allocation was changed from Economic Capital to Regulatory Capital in the March 2019 half and comparative information was restated. This method is designed to help drive appropriate risk management and ensure business returns align with the level of risk.

APRA has announced that it does not expect that the changes to the risk weights will necessitate further increases in capital for ADIs, although this could vary by ADI depending on the final requirements.",
    "APRA released a discussion paper in August 2018 on adjustments to the overall design of the capital framework to improve transparency,",
    "international comparability and flexibility of the ADI capital framework. The focus of the proposals is on the presentation of the capital ratios to facilitate comparability whilst recognising the relative capital strength of ADIs and measures to enhance supervisory flexibility in times of financial stress. APRA’s consultation for the above is currently taking place with final prudential standards planned to be made available by 2020.",
    "APRA’s consultation for the above is currently taking place with target implementation by 2022 without any phase-in arrangements. Given the number of items that are currently open for consultation with APRA, the final outcome of the FSI including any further changes to APRA’s prudential standards or other impacts on the Group remains uncertain.",
    "APRA Total Loss Absorbing Capacity Requirements",
    "In July 2019, APRA announced its decision on loss-absorbing capacity in which it will require domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs), including ANZ, to increase their Total Capital by 3% of risk-weighted assets by January 2024. Based on ANZ’s capital position as at 30 September 2019, this represents an incremental increase in the Total Capital requirement of approximately $12 billion, with an equivalent decrease in other senior funding. APRA has stated that it anticipates that D-SIBs would satisfy the requirement predominantly with Tier 2 capital.",
    "Revisions to Related Entities Framework",
    "APRA announced in August 2019 that it will implement its proposal to reduce limits for Australian ADIs’ exposure to related entities, reducing limits from 50% of Level 1 Total capital to 25% of Level 1 Tier 1 capital from January 2021. As exposures are measured net of capital deductions, the proposed changes to APRA’s capital regulations (contained in APS111 below) would affect the measurement of ADI exposures. On the basis that the APS111 revisions are implemented as currently proposed, the reduction in the above limits is not expected to have a material impact on ANZ and its subsidiaries.",
    "Revisions to APS111 Capital Adequacy",
    "In October 2019, APRA released a discussion paper on draft revisions to the prudential standards APS111 Capital Adequacy: Measurement of Capital for consultation. The most material change from APRA’s proposal is in relation to the treatment of capital investments for each banking and insurance subsidiary at Level 1 with the tangible component of the investment changing from 400% risk weighting to:",
    "250% risk weighting up to an amount equal to 10% of ANZ’s net Level 1 Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1); and",
    "the remainder of the investment will be treated as a CET1 capital deduction.",
    "ANZ is reviewing the implications for its current investments. The net impact on the Group is unclear and will depend upon a number of factors including the capitalisation of the affected subsidiaries at the time of implementation, the final form of the prudential standard, as well as the effect of management actions being pursued that have the potential to materially offset the impact of these proposals. Based on ANZ’s current investment in its affected subsidiaries and in the absence of any offsetting management actions, the above proposals implies a reduction in ANZ’s Level 1 CET1 capital ratio of up to approximately $2.5bn (~75 basis points). However, ANZ believes that this outcome is unlikely and, post implementation of management actions, the net capital impact could be minimal. There is no impact on ANZ’s Level 2 CET1 capital ratio arising from these proposed changes, which are proposed to be implemented from 1 January 2021.",
    "Level 3 Conglomerates (Level 3)",
    "APRA is extending its prudential supervision framework to Conglomerate Groups via the Level 3 framework which will regulate a bancassurance group such as ANZ as a single economic entity with minimum capital requirements and additional monitoring of risk exposure levels.",
    "In August 2016, APRA confirmed the deferral of capital requirements for Conglomerate Groups to allow for the final capital requirements arising from FSI recommendations and from international initiatives to be determined.",
    "The non-capital components of the Level 3 framework relating to group governance, risk exposures, intragroup transactions and other risk management and compliance requirements came into effect on 1 July 2017. These have had no material impact on the Group’s capital position.",
    " The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) review of capital requirements",
    "The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has been reviewing its New Zealand capital adequacy framework. The RBNZ expects to announce its finalised policy decisions in early December 2019 which include the outcomes of the RBNZ consultation relating to the amount, form and timing of implementation. This may include amongst other things:",
    "increases in the risk weighting applied to the assets of banks in New Zealand;",
    "increases to the percentage of capital held against those risk weights in New Zealand; and",
    "changes to the regulatory capital criteria for subordinated instruments.",
    "The overall impact on the Group depends on a number of factors. These include the outcome of the RBNZ consultations, ANZ New Zealand’s balance sheet at the time of implementation, and the outcome of other reviews currently underway by APRA.",

To calculate cash profit, the Group excludes non-core items from statutory profit (refer to Definitions for further details).

With the sale completion of the OnePath Life (NZ) Ltd business, the March 2019 half includes the reversal of the life-to-date cash profit adjustments on the revaluation of policy liabilities sold, increasing cash profit before tax by $115 million ($81 million after tax).",

    "The Group enters into economic hedges to manage its interest rate and foreign exchange risk which, in accordance with accounting standards, result in fair value gains and losses being recognised within the Income Statement. ANZ removes the fair value adjustments from cash profit since the profit or loss resulting from the hedge transactions will reverse over time to match with the profit or loss from the economically hedged item as part of cash profit. This includes gains and losses arising from approved classes of derivatives not designated in accounting hedge relationships but which are considered to be economic hedges, including hedges of larger foreign exchange denominated revenue and expense streams, primarily NZD and USD (and USD correlated), as well as ineffectiveness from designated accounting hedges. Economic hedges comprise:",
    "Funding related swaps (primarily cross currency interest rate swaps) used to convert the proceeds of foreign currency debt issuances into floating rate Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar debt. As these swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting, movements in the fair values are recorded in the Income Statement.

    "Ineffectiveness from designated accounting hedge relationships.",
    "In the September 2019 full year, the majority of the loss on economic hedges adjusted from cash profit relates to funding related swaps, principally from narrowing basis spreads on AUD/USD and NZD/USD currency pairs partially offset by the weakening of both the AUD and NZD against USD.",

This involved selling credit default swaps (CDSs) as protection over specific debt structures and purchasing CDS protection over the same structures. ANZ has subsequently exited its positions with six US financial guarantors and is monitoring the remaining two portfolios with a view to reducing the exposures when ANZ deems it cost effective relative to the perceived risk associated with a specific trade or counterparty.",
    "The notional value of outstanding bought and sold CDSs at 30 September 2019 amounted to $0.3 billion (Mar 19: $0.3 billion; Sep 18: $0.3 billion). While both the bought and sold CDSs are measured at fair value through profit and loss, the associated fair value movements do not fully offset due to the impact of credit risk on the bought CDSs which is driven by market movements in credit spreads and AUD/USD and NZD/USD rates. The fair value of the CDSs (excluding CVA) is $19 million (Mar 19: $20 million; Sep 18: $26 million) with CVA on the bought protection of $3 million (Mar 19: $4 million; Sep 18: $4 million).",

    "The impact of SRCB has been treated as an adjustment between statutory profit to cash profit. The rationale being the loss on reclassification to held for sale was expected to be largely offset by the release of reserve gains on sale completion within the 2017 full year. The transaction was subsequently completed in the 2018 full year and the entire impact of the transaction was recognised in cash profit.",

    "ANZ shares held by the Group in Wealth Australia discontinued operations are deemed to be Treasury shares for accounting purposes. Dividends and realised and unrealised gains and losses from these shares are reversed as they are not permitted to be recognised as income for statutory reporting purposes. In deriving cash profit, these earnings are included to ensure there is no asymmetrical impact on the Group’s profits because the Treasury shares are held to support policy liabilities which are revalued through the Income Statement. With the sale completion of the life insurance business to Zurich, there are no further ANZ shares held by the Group in Wealth Australia discontinued operations (Mar 19: 15.5 million shares; Sep 18: 15.5 million shares).",

    "Discontinued operations are separately presented from the results of the continuing operations as a single line item ‘profit/(loss) after tax from discontinued operations’ in the Condensed Consolidated Income Statement.

    "The Group has applied AASB 9 effective from 1 October 2018 (with the exception of the ‘own credit’ requirements relating to financial liabilities designated as measured at fair value, which were early adopted by the Group effective from 1 October 2013). In addition the Group chose to early adopt AASB 2017-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (AASB 2017-6) effective from 1 October 2018.",
    "AASB 9 and AASB 2017-6 stipulate new requirements for the impairment of financial assets, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and general hedge accounting. Details of the key new requirements are outlined below, and a reconciliation of the transitional impact at 1 October 2018 is set out in Note 16.",
    "Impairment",
    "AASB 9 introduces a new impairment model based on expected credit losses (ECL). This model is applied to:",
    "Financial assets measured at amortised cost;",
    "Debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI);",
    "Lease receivables; and",
    "Loan commitments and financial guarantees not measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).",
    "Expected credit loss impairment model",
    "The measurement of expected credit losses reflects an unbiased, probability weighted prediction which evaluates a range of scenarios and takes into account the time value of money, past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.",
    "Expected credit losses are either measured over 12 months or the expected lifetime of the financial asset, depending on credit deterioration since origination, according to the following three-stage approach:",
    "Stage 1: At the origination of a financial asset, and where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, an allowance",
    "equivalent to 12 months ECL is recognised reflecting the expected credit losses resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months from the reporting date. For instruments with a remaining maturity of less than 12 months, expected credit losses are estimated based on default events that are possible over the remaining time to maturity.",
    "Stage 2: Where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised reflecting expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. If credit risk were to improve in a subsequent period such that the increase in credit risk since origination is no longer considered significant, the exposure returns to a Stage 1 classification and a 12 month ECL applies.",
    "Stage 3: Where there is objective evidence of impairment, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised.",
    "Expected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for exposures in Stage 1 and Stage 2, and on either a collective or individual basis when transferred to Stage 3.",
    "Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)",
    "Stage 2 assets are those that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination. In determining what constitutes a SICR, the Group considers both qualitative and quantitative information:",
    "i.",
    "Internal credit rating grade",
    "For the majority of portfolios, the primary indicator of a SICR is a significant deterioration in the internal credit rating grade of a facility since origination and is measured by application of thresholds.",
    "For non-retail portfolios, a SICR is determined by comparing the Customer Credit Rating (CCR) applicable to a facility at reporting date to the CCR at origination of that facility. A CCR is assigned to each borrower which reflects the probability of default of the borrower and incorporates both borrower",
    "and non-borrower specific information, including forward looking information. CCRs are subject to review at least annually or more frequently when an event occurs which could affect the credit risk of the customer.",
    "For retail portfolios, a SICR is determined by comparing each facility’s scenario weighted lifetime probability of default at the reporting date to the scenario weighted lifetime probability of default at origination. The scenario weighted lifetime probability of default may increase significantly if:",
    "there has been a deterioration in the economic outlook, or an increase in economic uncertainty; or",
    "there has been a deterioration in the customer’s overall credit position, or ability to manage their credit obligations.",
    "ii. Backstop criteria",
    "The Group uses 30 days past due arrears as a backstop criteria for both non-retail and retail portfolios. For retail portfolios only, facilities are required to demonstrate three to six months of good payment behaviour prior to returning to Stage 1.",
    "Measurement of expected credit loss",
    "ECL is calculated as the product of the following credit risk factors at a facility level, discounted to incorporate the time value of money:",
    "Exposure at default (EAD) - the expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and interest, expected",
    "additional drawdowns and accrued interest;",
    "Probability of default (PD) - the estimate of the likelihood that a borrower will default over a given period; and",
    "Loss given default (LGD) - the expected loss in the event of the borrower defaulting, expressed as a percentage of the facility's EAD, taking into account direct and indirect recovery costs.",
    "These credit risk factors are adjusted for current and forward looking information through the use of macro-economic variables.",
    "Forward looking information",
    "In applying forward looking information for estimating ECL, the Group considers four probability-weighted forecast economic scenarios as follows:",
    "(i) Base case scenario",
    "The base case scenario is ANZ’s view of the most likely future macro-economic conditions. It reflects management’s assumptions used for strategic planning and budgeting, and also informs the Group Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) which is the process the Group applies in its strategic and capital planning over a 3 year time horizon;",
    "(ii) Upside and (iii) Downside scenarios",
    "The upside and downside scenarios are fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions (that is, they are not based on the economic conditions prevailing at balance date) and are based on a combination of more optimistic (in the case of the upside) and pessimistic (in the case of the downside) economic events and uncertainty over long term horizons; and",
    "(iv) Severe downside scenario",
    "The severe downside scenario is fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions and accounts for the potentially severe impact of less likely extremely adverse economic conditions. It reflects macro-economic conditions of a downturn economic event with a probability of occurrence once in every 25 years.",
    "The four scenarios are described in terms of macro-economic variables used in the PD, LGD and EAD models (collectively the ECL models) depending on the portfolio and country of the borrower. Examples of the variables include unemployment rates, GDP growth rates, house price indices, commercial property price indices and consumer price indices.",
    "Probability weighting each scenario is determined by management by considering risks and uncertainties surrounding the base case scenario, as well as specific portfolio considerations where required. The Group’s Credit and Market Risk Committee (CMRC) is responsible for reviewing and approving forecast economic scenarios and the associated probability weights applied to each scenario.",
    "Where applicable, adjustments may be made to account for situations where known or expected risks have not been adequately addressed in the modelling process. CMRC is responsible for approving such adjustments.",
    "Expected Life",
    "When estimating ECL for exposures in Stage 2 and 3, the Group considers the expected lifetime over which it is exposed to credit risk.",
    "For non-retail portfolios, the Group uses the maximum contractual period as the expected lifetime for non-revolving credit facilities. For non-retail revolving credit facilities, such as corporate lines of credit, the expected life reflects the Group’s contractual right to withdraw a facility as part of a contractually agreed annual review, after taking into account the applicable notice period.",
    "For retail portfolios, the expected lifetime is determined using behavioural term, taking into account expected prepayment behaviour and substantial modifications.",
    "Definition of default, credit impaired and write-offs",
    "The definition of default used in measuring expected credit losses is aligned to the definition used for internal credit risk management purposes across all portfolios. This definition is also in line with the regulatory definition of default. Default occurs when there are indicators that a debtor is unlikely to fully satisfy contractual credit obligations to the Group, or the exposure is 90 days past due.",
    "Financial assets, including those that are well secured, are considered credit impaired for financial reporting purposes when they default.",
    "When there is no realistic probability of recovery, loans are written off against the related impairment allowance on completion of the Group’s internal processes and when all reasonably expected recoveries have been collected. In subsequent periods, any recoveries of amounts previously written-off are credited to the credit impairment charge in the income statement.",
    "Modified financial assets",
    "If the terms of a financial asset are modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one for either credit or commercial reasons, an assessment is made to determine if the changes to the terms of the existing financial asset are considered substantial. This assessment considers both",
    "changes in cash flows arising from the modified terms as well as changes in the overall instrument risk profile; for example, changes in the principal (credit limit), term, or type of underlying collateral. Where a modification is considered non-substantial, the existing financial asset is not derecognised and its date of origination continues to be used to determine SICR. Where a modification is considered substantial, the existing financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at its fair value on the modification date, which also becomes the date of origination used to determine SICR for this new asset.",
    "Classification and measurement",
    "Financial assets - general",
    "There are three measurement classifications for financial assets under AASB 9: amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Financial assets are classified into these measurement classifications on the basis of two criteria:",
    "the business model within which the financial asset is managed; and",
    "the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset (specifically whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest).",
    "The resultant financial asset classifications are as follows:",
    "Amortised cost: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest only and which are held in a",
    "business model whose objective is to collect their cash flows;",
    "FVOCI: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest only and which are held in a business",
    "model whose objective is to collect their cash flows or to sell; and",
    "FVTPL: Any other financial assets not falling into the categories above are measured at FVTPL.",
    "Fair Value Option for Financial Assets",
    "A financial asset may be irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition when the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.",
    "Financial assets - equity instruments",
    "Non-traded equity investments may be designated at FVOCI on an instrument by instrument basis. If this election is made, gains or losses are not reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss on disposal of the investment. However, gains or losses may be reclassified within equity.",
    "Financial liabilities",
    "The classification and measurement requirements for financial liabilities under AASB 9 are largely consistent with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (AASB 139) with the exception that for financial liabilities designated as measured at fair value, gains or losses relating to changes in the entity’s own credit risk are included in other comprehensive income, except where doing so would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. This part of the standard was early adopted by the Group on 1 October 2013.",
    "Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, or fair value through profit or loss when they are held for trading. Additionally, financial liabilities can be designated at FVTPL where:",
    "The designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch which would otherwise arise; or",
    "A group of financial liabilities are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk",
    "management strategy; or",
    "The financial liability contains one or more embedded derivatives unless:",
    "a) the embedded derivative does not significantly modify the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract, or",
    "b) the embedded derivative is closely related to the host financial liability.",
    "General hedge accounting",
    "AASB 9 introduces new hedge accounting requirements which more closely align accounting with risk management activities undertaken when hedging financial and non-financial risks. The Group has exercised an accounting policy choice to continue to apply the AASB 139 hedge accounting requirements until the International Accounting Standards Board’s ongoing Dynamic Risk Management (macro hedging) project is completed.",
    "AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (AASB 15)",
    "The Group adopted AASB 15 from 1 October 2018 which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to amounts recognised in the full year condensed consolidated financial statements. The standard requires identification of distinct performance obligations within a contract, and allocation of the transaction price of the contract to those performance obligations. Revenue is then recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied. The standard also provides guidance on whether an entity is acting as a principal or an agent which impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis. In accordance with the transitional provisions of AASB 15, the Group has adopted the full retrospective transition approach whereby the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard has been recognised as an adjustment to opening retained earnings as at 1 October 2017 and comparative information for the 2018 reporting period has been restated.",
    "The adoption of AASB 15 resulted in the following accounting changes:",
    "i) Recognition of trail commission revenue: trail commission revenue previously recognised over time is now recognised at the time the Group initially",
    "distributes the underlying product to the customer where it is highly probable the revenue will not need to be reversed in future periods.",
    "This policy change resulted in an increase to the opening balances of Other assets of $32 million, Deferred tax liabilities of $10 million and Retained earnings of $22 million as at 1 October 2017 to recognise revenue that qualifies for upfront recognition under AASB 15 but was not previously recognised under AASB 118 Revenue (AASB 118). The change did not impact net profit or earnings per share in the comparative period.",
    "ii) Presentation: Certain credit card loyalty costs and other costs will be presented as operating expenses where the Group has assessed that it is",
    "acting as principal (rather than an agent). Previously these costs were presented as a reduction in other operating income. In addition, certain",
    "91",
    "incentives received from card scheme providers related to card marketing activities will be presented as Operating income where the Group has assessed that it is acting as principal (rather than an agent). Previously these incentives were presented as a reduction in Operating expenses.",
    "The presentation of these costs under AASB 15 increased other operating income and operating expenses equally by $91 million and $62 million in the comparative periods ending 30 September 2018 and 31 March 2018 respectively. The changes did not impact net profit or earnings per share in the comparative periods.",
    "A minor balance sheet reclassification associated with credit card loyalty programs is set out in Note 16.",
    "ii) Basis of measurement",
    "The financial information has been prepared in accordance with the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value:",
    "derivative financial instruments as well as, in the case of fair value hedges, the fair value adjustment on the underlying hedged exposure;",
    "financial assets and liabilities held for trading;",
    "financial assets and liabilities designed at fair value through profit and loss;",
    "available-for-sale financial assets (applicable prior to 1 October 2018);",
    "financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (applicable from 1 October 2018);",
    "assets and liabilities held for sale (except those at carrying value as per Note 10).",
    "In accordance with AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts, life insurance liabilities are measured using the Margin on Services model.",
    "In accordance with AASB 119 Employee Benefits, defined benefit obligations are measured using the Projected Unit Credit method.",
    "iii) Use of estimates, assumptions and judgements",
    "The preparation of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires the use of management judgement, estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and the application of accounting policies. Discussion of the critical accounting estimates and judgements, which include complex or subjective decisions or assessments are provided in Note 1 of the 2019 ANZ Annual Financial Report – (when released). Such estimates and judgements are reviewed on an ongoing basis.",
    "At 30 September 2019, the impairment assessment of non-lending assets identified that two of the Group’s associate investments AMMB Holdings Berhad (AmBank) and PT Bank Pan Indonesia (PT Panin) had indicators of impairment. Although their market value (based on share price) was below their carrying value, no impairment was recognised as their carrying values are supported by their value in use (VIU) calculations.",
    "The VIU calculations are sensitive to a number of key assumptions, including discount rates, long term growth rates, future profitability and capital levels. A change in key assumptions could have an adverse impact on the recoverable amount of the investment. The key assumptions used in the VIU calculations are outlined below:",

    "Customer remediation provision",
    "At 30 September 2019, the Group has recognised provisions of $1,139 million (Mar 19: $698 million; Sep 18: $602 million) in respect of customer remediation which includes provisions for expected refunds to customers, remediation project costs and costs associated and related customer and regulatory claims, penalties and litigation outcomes.",
    "Determining the amount of the provisions, which represent management’s best estimate of the cost of settling the identified matters, requires the exercise of significant judgement. It will often be necessary to form a view on a number of different assumptions, including the number of impacted customers, the average refund per customer, associated remediation project costs, and the implications of regulatory exposures and customer claims having regard to their specific facts and circumstances.",
    "Consequently, the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions is reviewed on a regular basis against actual experience and other relevant evidence including expert legal advice, and adjustments are made to the provisions where appropriate.",
    "Assets and liabilities held for sale",
    "When classifying assets and liabilities as held for sale, judgement is required when assessing whether it is highly probable that contracted sales will complete within 12 months after balance date, particularly when the sale is subject to third party approvals. Management regularly reviews the status of each sale transaction to ensure the classification remains appropriate.",
    "Management is required to exercise significant judgement when assessing the fair value less costs to sell for assets and liabilities held for sale. The judgemental factors include determining: costs to sell, allocation of goodwill, indemnities provided under the sale contract and consideration received - particularly where elements of consideration are contingent in nature. Any impairment we record is based on the best available evidence of fair value compared to the carrying value before the impairment. The final sale price may be different to the fair value we estimate when recording the impairment.",

    "The Group reassess the useful lives of software assets on a semi-annual basis. During the September 2018 full year, certain software assets in the Institutional and Australia Retail and Commercial divisions had their useful life reassessed.",
    "iv) Rounding of amounts",
    "The amounts contained in these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been rounded to the nearest million dollars, except where otherwise indicated, as permitted by Australian Securities and Investments Commission Corporations Instrument 2016/191.",
    "v) Future accounting developments",
    "AASB 9 - General hedge accounting",
    "AASB 9 introduces new hedge accounting requirements which more closely align accounting with risk management activities undertaken when hedging financial and non-financial risks.",
    "AASB 9 provides the Group with an accounting policy choice to continue to apply AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (AASB 139) hedge accounting requirements until the International Accounting Standards Board’s ongoing project on macro hedge accounting is completed. The Group currently applies the hedge accounting requirements of AASB 139.",
    "AASB 16 Leases (AASB 16)",
    "AASB 16 is effective for the Group from 1 October 2019 and replaces the previous standard AASB 117 Leases (AASB 117). AASB 16 primarily impacts the Group’s property and technology leases which were previously classified as operating leases. Under AASB 117, operating leases were not recognised on balance sheet and rent payments were expensed over the lease term.",
    "Under AASB 16, lessees must recognise all leases (except for leases of low value assets and short term leases) on balance sheet under a single accounting model. Accordingly, the Group will recognise its right to use an underlying leased asset over the lease term as a right-of-use (ROU) asset, and its obligation to make lease payments as a lease liability. In the income statement, the Group will recognise depreciation expense on the ROU asset and interest expense on the lease liability. As a result, lease expenses will be higher in the early periods of a lease and lower in the later periods of the lease compared to the previous standard where expenses were constant over the lease term. Cumulative expenses over the life of a lease will not change.",
    "The Group will apply the modified retrospective transition approach whereby initial lease liabilities are recognised based on the present value of remaining lease payments as of the transition date. The initial ROU asset recognised for certain large commercial and retail leases will be measured as if AASB 16 had always been applied to the leases. For all other leases, the initial ROU asset will be measured as equal to the initial lease liability. Based on this transition approach, the Group expects to recognise an increase in liabilities of $1.7 billion and an increase in assets of $1.6 billion. This is expected to result in a reduction to opening retained earnings of $82 million and an increase in deferred tax assets of $43 million as of 1 October 2019. Comparative information from prior periods will not be restated.",
    "The implementation of AASB 16 requires management to make certain key judgements including the determination of lease terms, discount rates and identifying arrangements that contain a lease. These estimates may be refined as the Group finalises its implementation of the standard in the first half of the 2020 financial year.",
    "Interest Rate Benchmark Reform",
    "Interbank offered rates (IBORs), such as LIBOR, are a key reference rate for derivatives, loans and securities for global financial markets. In response to concerns about the transparency and liquidity of IBOR rates, regulators in a number of jurisdictions across the globe are well advanced in developing benchmark rates to phase out and replace IBORs, these projects are collectively known as ‘IBOR Reform’. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is also considering the financial reporting implications of IBOR reform which is expected to impact elements of financial instrument accounting, including hedge accounting, loan modifications, fair value methodologies and disclosures.",
    "The IASB project is split into two phases: Phase 1 deals with pre-replacement issues (issues affecting financial reporting in the period before the replacement of IBOR’s); and Phase 2 deals with replacement issues (issues affecting financial reporting when existing IBOR’s are replaced).",
    "In September 2019, the IASB issued a final standard, Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 which focuses on ‘pre-rate replacement issues’ and provides exceptions to specific hedge accounting requirements under IAS 39 and IFRS 9 so that entities will be able to apply those hedge accounting requirements under an assumption that the interest rate benchmark is not altered as a result of the interest rate benchmark reform. In October 2019, AASB adopted these amendments in AASB 2019-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform.",
    "Although the Group anticipates the new standard, once adopted, will provide certain relief in relation to hedge accounting requirements, for 30 September 2019 reporting purposes, it has considered the existing portfolio of hedge accounted relationships in light of:",
    "the significant uncertainty surrounding the method and timing of transition away from IBORs; and",
    "ongoing application and reliance in capital markets on IBOR’s for financial instrument pricing.",
    "As result of the above factors, the Group has concluded that continuation of hedge accounting relationships for potentially impacted hedge relationship remains appropriate.",
    "The Group is considering the new standard which is effective on 1 October 2020 but may be adopted earlier.",

The new price of $850 million includes approximately $25 million that ANZ has already received for the sale of ADGs in October 2018. The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements.

There have also been significant increases in the nature and scale of regulatory investigations and reviews, civil and criminal enforcement actions (whether by court action or otherwise), formal and informal inquiries, regulatory supervisory activities and the quantum of fines issued by regulators, particularly against financial institutions both in Australia and globally. The Group has received various notices and requests for information from its regulators as part of both industry-wide and Group-specific reviews and has also made disclosures to its regulators at its own instigation. The nature of these interactions can be wide ranging and, for example, currently include a range of matters including responsible lending practices, product suitability and distribution, interest and fees and the entitlement to charge them, customer remediation, wealth advice, insurance distribution, pricing, competition, conduct in financial markets and financial transactions, capital market transactions, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations, reporting and disclosure obligations and product disclosure documentation. There may be exposures to customers which are additional to any regulatory exposures. These could include class actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities. The outcomes and total costs associated with such reviews and possible exposures remain uncertain.",
    "Bank fees litigation and periodical payment remediation and ASIC action",
    "A litigation funder commenced a class action against the Company in 2010, followed by a second similar class action in March 2013. The applicants contended that certain exception fees (honour, dishonour and non-payment fees on transaction accounts and late payment and over-limit fees on credit cards) were unenforceable penalties and that various of the fees were also unenforceable under statutory provisions governing unconscionable conduct, unfair contract terms and unjust transactions. The claims in the March 2013 class action failed and have been dismissed.",
    "The original claims in the 2010 class action have been dismissed. In 2017, a new claim was added to the 2010 class action, in relation to the Company’s entitlement to charge certain periodical payment non-payment fees. Part of the class of customers had already received remediation payments from the Company. An agreement to settle the claim was reached in December 2018. The settlement is subject to court approval.",
    "In July 2019, ASIC commenced civil penalty proceedings against the Company in relation to the charging of fees for periodical payments in certain circumstances between August 2003 and February 2016.

ASIC also alleges that the Company engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct and breached certain statutory obligations as a financial services licensee. The matter is at an early stage. The outcomes and total costs remain uncertain. The Company is defending the allegations.",
    "Benchmark/rate actions",
    "In July and August 2016, class action complaints were brought in the United States District Court against local and international banks, including the Company – one action relating to the bank bill swap rate (BBSW), and one action relating to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR) and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate (SOR). The class actions are expressed to apply to persons and entities that engaged in US-based transactions in financial instruments that were priced, benchmarked, and/or settled based on BBSW or SIBOR. The claimants seek damages or compensation in amounts not specified, and allege that the defendant banks, including the Company, violated US anti-trust laws and (in the BBSW case only) anti- racketeering laws, the Commodity Exchange Act, and unjust enrichment principles. The Company is defending the proceedings. The matters are at an early stage.",
    "In February 2017, the South African Competition Commission commenced proceedings against local and international banks including the Company alleging breaches of the cartel provisions of the South African Competition Act in respect of trading in the South African rand.

The matter is at an early stage. The Company and its senior employee are defending the allegations.",
    "In September 2018, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) commenced civil penalty proceedings against the Company alleging failure to comply with continuous disclosure obligations in connection with the Company’s August 2015 underwritten institutional equity placement. ASIC alleges the Company should have advised the market that the joint lead managers took up approximately 25.5 million ordinary shares of the placement. The matter is at an early stage. The Company is defending the allegations.",
    "Franchisee litigation",

The new price of $850 million includes approximately $25 million that ANZ has already received for the sale of ADGs in October 2018. The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements. Subject to APRA approval, the Group expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. The impact of the reduction in price has been reflected in the 2019 financial results.",
