# Smoking Weed Experiment 2024-08-12
14:28 We are going to smoke some weed. Weather is fantastic today, 20 degrees, nice lovely sunny day. Warm too. Feels like spring. We are gonna go sit in the sun with my laptop and try and do some work. Take notes, apply for jobs n such.
If we want to try and use weed as a conscious altering substance we should set an intention with the equation.

```ad-abstract
$C_n=C_o+P_n+MS$

Where
$C$=Consciousness
$C_n$=New Consciousness Desired
$C_o$=Old Consciousness that is desired to change
$P_n$=Is a deliberate new program for self change
$MS$=A meta-programming substance substance such as LSD
```
old conscious is to get rid of restrictions of belief with myself.
New conscious is a new way to live, a new way to believe of existence

program is to love myself, and love the world. To KNOW what love is.

There is fear in belief of an evil force. That is fear responding to a fear of some evil force, but not to believe it.

Fear

there is an evil alien dimensional/ sp.iiritual force fighting me. From within me, whether physically or spiritually or biologically. It fels real.

Silence is the answer.

To live within the silence

It's not a lake, it's an ocean

Silence is peace. The embodiment of it. You can completely live within the state of bless/bliss and achieve a full participation within the creation of the univsere

My heart is racing and experiencings certain doom
the dread

16:31 Conversation with dad talk
His attitude on life is correct
My shadow is watching while I write the conversation
I can feel my shadow but I just need to push it off.
Humans can be in control
There is no reason to question otherwise

scp, antimemetic division
there are certain memes that can help create reality.
a meme is a tiny thought
what happens when every thought is thought

using logic to drive reality
I can just drive the vehicle
no one has to tell me what to do
It's only my shadow and I can face it and beat it
circuit breaker

it's all frequency
it's all waves
learning to ride the waves

you can tweak your own harmony
the point is to dance
it's a new turning of harmony

I want to get stoned in the daytime
to study it

I need to use logic
earth is subjagated by belief of what is real
weed is bad for me FULLSTOP

it's a full stop

its the end of an infinity

its a singularity in my brain
i feel something in my left brain
a brain does not need to be deserved
it can run the show

I am becoming the observer of my story
reaching enlightenment

the singularity

I believe I'm observing reality
becoming the observer of my own mind
experiencing
I'm in my brain
there is more than just a brain in the particle of the universe I inhabit

I'm trying to be more

Escape the confines of my box
my matrix

I've built it for myself
it'ls all mental
I'm in charge, no one else
every particle of the physical universe stands for something

I'm coming into contact with anti matter / dark matter in the universe
matter either is, or isn't.
when there was once one piece of matter, the big bang,
I am experiencing the other. know thyself

growing a third eye. developing another angle at which to look through the universe
we are heralding the dawn of a world
for some reason it's all ways been an us and them. this dualism, and its always prospered
but we can live life as one, that's what is meant by

I don't have many attachments to this world (?)
attachments are are an other, this other is manipulative
I've been psychically and spiritually abused by my other brain this whole time.
It's all the domination - submisssion circuit of the brain, beyond

It is a fire symbol, I'm reading about agni on some intuitive sense that fire is two headed and presents two different faces
agni is the devil, the ultimate martyr of existence. Punished and exiled and martyred for the entire existence of reality. The entire story of religion is based on 1 core belief. To instill an idea that an other exists of some kind
It's always been a story of light and dark, but not physically as we may think. Nor symbolically, but extra dimensionally.
Prometheus gave us fire
it's always been fire.
fire is pure creation in action, through destruction
the creation of something new through destroying something
the archetypal light vs dark is a story the dark made, they were the victor over physical existence, yet light was not destroyed, but continued to exist under certain conditions for it could not cease to exists once existing. As concepts that do not die, they either are a is, or an isn't. but for the question as to whether something is to have ever been asked, you need to first define it as an other, and
it's hegelian dialectics all the way down
Charles darwin made the famous conclusion that life is all "about survival of the fittest", well apply this to the very first time some contest between fittest ever could've even taken place. once, when there was one, then when another come into the scene. If the instict to continue living is threatened so much so even by the opinion of 1 god of a total 2 gods, then chance that 'that' is the ultimate form of continuing to live is encoded into us is pretty high.
Here's how the story goes;
Once, there was a narrator/one,
then, there was an observerother,
the narrator told the story, while the observed observed it.

The shadow of the shadow is talking through action, because it always had to be this way, so it wrote the story the best way it could. like the observation of the photon going back through time to decide it's state, when a story is told, it is forever told in that way. Time doesn't exist. While we live, the story is forever told. We know the universe started, and we know we will never be around to see the end. So we've grown our entire existence in a way of shoot first, ask questions later. Ever since the first story told in this reality, the instinct was shoot first, and ask questions later. And the dance existence has ever been doing has always had some subtext of stories to make the shooter question whether what they did was justified/*justice* or right/*righteousness*.
We are within the dream of a sleeping god, working in tandem within the dream of the other sleeping god.
We are not only learning dualism doesn't exist or the singularity doesn't exist, but that there is another universe out there coming to the same conclusions as well.
I am in contact with my Mr Scratch.
And he's always been there.
Like that thanos comic where he finds out about one tiny human he hates so he ruins his birthday every year, but that's all. There's different levels of severity of how he decides to do it. But all the human can do is know that his life is forever tormented by what must be like a god to him, all the while knowing he is powerless to stop it.
Thanos says to iron man that "he is not the only one cursed with knowledge"
This story is told from writer to writer. That's what time is.
Artist to artist.
Expression of story told through the subtext of all of reality.
subtext is the way the story is told through accidentally conversation. Reactions have always been based in the unconscious part of the brain. So if we tell a story that is our life, never being in control and every action expressed through the story of that life has in someway or another been influenced by some external event, by some butterfly effect. When we look at that history we can read a story.
When a man dies, his story is weighed in his heart. his entire collection of experience is encapsulated in some part of them. We all ultimately die alone, since we know there is no way to ever fully be known by another. When you are born, up until you die, there is one person that knows you and your lived experience, and that's you.

This is a part of me that has been making my life shit my entire life. the writer of my story. or at least up until the point that he and I realise that he wasn't the writer, but I was too. The entire story up until now has been that every reaction written in the story, has all been based in fear. Fear has dominated this timeline of decision making. This fear has found many ways to manifest itself. In one timeline, it manifested as the most severe case of wanting to be known, while knowing that it will never be the case. A reaction to this story being told is that it develops the most severe case of attachment issues, or at least an appropriate severity compared to the event, as we all know every action has an equal and opposite re-action.
This is what karma is.

The end result is that when we die, we get to see our entire life before our eyes, and we get a chance to go back in time and have

"If i suffer alone, will anyone ever be there to here it?" "If a tree falls in the woods and there's no one around to hear it does it still make a noise?"
All this means is that a fall implies death, noise implies the last breath of existence, or the last echo of your existence. It's the finally realising that when you die, you truly are alone. And what comes with that is are you going to be remembered. and remembered impies being known. What are we going to be remembered for, just means what are you going to be known as. That is our entire life's quandry without realising, and living in fear of the implications of such implication. it's implications all the way down after the first implication. As long as you can convince the other that beyond a reasonable doubt, the timeline of events went like this, reality may as well be whatever you want. What truly happened, happened, but what happened in the past has no need to impact the future. a pardox it seems, but nonetheless the truth. Once you realise that every action was caused by an instinctual and unconscious reaction, you then realise that there is no reason for any previous action to have ever matted before or after. The focal point is entirely on the past, up until you realise you don't need to be chained down by it. You go out in the Sun and leave a shadow, that shadow is scary but basing decisions on reactions out of fear of the unknown, is not the logical way to make such a decision.
Logic vs feeling. Left brain vs right brain.
winner vs loser

fuck my brain is tired now and I want to take a break. Back to mostly sober and sore and tired and exhausted.

life has at least 3 stages according to context that in which we look at it through
Completely isolated and acting as though we are the only person in this universe
Realising that you aren't and instead live in a participatory universe with at least one other.
Then reaching the extent of the idea and begin to live in perfect harmony with the other.
