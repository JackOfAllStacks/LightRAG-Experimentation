# Inspirations
- The Half Life series with the tale of the Combine. Them being an interdimensional alien species that enslave alien planets and races, destroy their independence and subsume the race into themselves. The combine aren't even known as to what they look like, they haven't been seen, only that of their slave subordinates.
- Alan wake and it's metafiction and autofiction
- [[Everything Everywhere All At Once]]
- The old assassins creed storyline where there is an eternal fight between the templars and the assassins. Even when the templars destroy the assassins in their time, the culture and drive of the templar order only pushes people to create an assassins order again to fight back. Whether the boot successfully stomps out and kills an ant nest, as long as the boot continues to stomp on ants, there will be ants that rise up to fight back.
- Donnie Darko and the tangent universes. The living receiver, the manipulated dead, the manipulated living. The artifacts. Time loops
- The Matrix / Plato's cave
- Control game and the federal bureau of control
- Stanley parable. "The end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never the end..."
- Annihilation the movie (Should read the book)
- Prison planet theory. Controlled by lizard aliens, mantis aliens and the Nordic aliens. Harvested for Loosh. Purposely made to experience bad emotions as that creates tastier loosh for them. More energy. Think of some fucked up guy that believes he can taste the difference of a lobster that was cooked alive vs a lobster killed first and then cooked. He does this because the lobster that goes through the suffering of being cooked alive emits certain emotions under the stress and pain that make it taste better. Imagine this but on the scale of a alien species that harvests spirit energy from humans. Our energy is tastier or better when it undergoes bad emotions compared to good emotions. So the economical or practical solution is to make a farm planet for humans where they manipulate conditions in order for the human race to experience as much hardship as possible. Squeezing us as much as they can, like wringing out a wet cloth. Coincidentally this is pretty much how capitalism works. Funny if the downfall of capitalism coincides with the discovery of this theory to be real. Capitalism and the subjugators both pushed just too hard to make everything collapse and cause retaliation that can crumble the empires and systems withholding them.
- Blade Runner 2049. Specifically the idea that the true miracle child born of a human and a replicant (or both replicants) has implanted a bit of herself into every replicant since a certain time (her memories). Joe discovers that he has memories that are real and not fabricated which causes him to believe that he is the miracle child. This causes him to fight for the movement like no other stimuli ever could, it shocks his system and changes his programming like nothing ever could. When he finds out that he isn't truly the miracle child, the replicant rebellion tell him that they all wish it were them, but that's not the point, whether it's him or not, it's a righteous fight that needs to be taken. It's the right thing to do. Even after Joe realises it isn't him, he gives his life for the movement. Whether someone is the messiah, the next coming of Jesus or not, it doesn't mean you shouldn't strive to be him. Whether you are the champion of the light, the saviour of us all, the reality of the situation doesn't matter as much as living like you are. If you're deluded into a state that you are the next coming of Jesus, believe it, embody what you think that is, and be it. Maybe we're all the next coming of Jesus. Maybe Jesus is within us all, ready to show himself. Don't let reality define you. We all need to be a bit delulu
