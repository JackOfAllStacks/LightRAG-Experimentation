# Meta Art
Meta art seems to be what I need to learn about, what I want to explore. Meta anything is where the real interesting stuff lies. The stuff we are able to take at face value is fine and all, but meta-blank is the super interesting hypothetical brain stimulating stuff. Meta-physics, meta-cognition, meta-gaming. It's a way of living within two worlds, or bringing 2 different realities into context of one another.
Research into successful meta art.

# **META, It's All about meta-blank**
I propose a way to achieve any kind of success or intellectual pursuit, is to do it in a meta way. *needs research*
