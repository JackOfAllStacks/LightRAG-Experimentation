# Swimming in the Waters
Jack feels he reaches a part of his own consciousness that allows him to break free from the constructed and refined reality tunnel we usually live in. He has been obsessed with the idea of consciousness for a long time, never quite understanding where the drive and impulse comes from. Nothing else stimulates his brain in the way he desires the way that thinking, learning and talking about this stuff does. In recent times he has fallen harder and harder for this woman, despite know she is bad and every other instinct tell him not to follow it, yet he goes for her anyway.
It's one Lady in the entire ocean that is the universe, and that way of living is the one thing that drive you forward. If you don't know what it is, then you live your life guided by it, clashing with other desires you identify with instead. [[False idols]], [[False Icons]], [[False Systems]], [[False Living]]. This is what causes us to live our life feeling like it is happening to us instead of us living the life we want. If you recognise this feeling of all of life is happening to you, then you may be a victim of this way of thinking. If just when you think life is going the right way, it takes a hard left and you get hit with the worst time of your life, that is a traumatic event. A near death experience of the soul. And when you live more and more a life you don't want to live, it gets you harder and harder until pressure makes diamonds and a real gem in the rough is born. With what feels like a squeeze of all collective conscious of the entire universe/multiverse pressing down on you, you need to push back.
The archetypal figure of [[Atlas]] comes to mind, when it feels like the entire world is pushing down on me and I'm the only one holding it up.
