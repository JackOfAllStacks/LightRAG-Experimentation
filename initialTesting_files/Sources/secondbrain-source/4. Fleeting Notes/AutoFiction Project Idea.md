# Autofiction Project Idea
I've recently been very inspired by the Alan Wake/Remedy Universe. Alan Wakes autofiction writing mixing in with his reality in a way that being a creator or artist shapes reality is a really interesting idea. The meta narrative is so intriguing. It's almost certainly projection or a bias of my own interpretation of it, but I consistently see messages within the story that feels adjacent to my own internal story.
I want to start making my own work. Writing my myth. Creating my chapel and writing my own religion/reality.
I already have an immense knowledge of ideas that I am already struggling to differentiate between what is real and what isn't. But perhaps it doesn't matter what's real anymore?
This seems to be what is termed as "shadow work" by Carl Jung and the Jungians. By interacting with this imaginal realm, what is real and not doesn't matter, because it is all symbolism for what the unconscious and conscious being are dealing with.
As long as I interact with this imaginal realm, mixing fiction with reality, there will be real results that can be taken away from the project. There is no real reason for it to be confined to this base reality.
Alan wake struggling to determine what is real and what isn't is what I want to go for. It's such an intriguing presence, Alan Wake 2, I'm only 5 hours in, which I've been very slow progressing, but it is so intriguing. I want to say amazing but I haven't experienced enough of it yet, but I am already in AWE with the world and world building and the mystery and story. It mimics real life in a certain way, or at least replicates the intrigue I have in the real world in a very rewarding way.

## Alter Egos
The way MF DOOM and the Alan Wake universe uses these alter egos are really attractive to me. Daniel Dumile is the real world creator behind all of the personas, but then he has MF DOOM, Viktor Vaughn, King Geedorah, Metal Fingers, Madvillian, DANGERDOOM, he does this mixing of realities with the real world in a way that is very interactive and engaging. Mixing his knowledge of comic books with the real world. I can do this too, with my background knowledge of all the pop-culture and pop-fiction, the movies and tv shows and narratives I know of gives me a good foundation.
Alan Wake is a part of the remedy universe that is created (as far as I know so far) by Sam Lake in the real world. The name Sam Lake and Alan Wake is an obvious comparison that I'm very certain is purposeful and if it isn't, it's a hell of a coincidence. No it's purposeful, gotta be. Anyway Sam Lakes face is also the basis of the character max payne, at least physically, I've never played the series and will probably have to in the future now. In Alan Wake 2, so far he plays 2 different meta characters as well as appearing as himself, Sam Lake in a fictional talk show alongside Alan Wake. He play's Sam Lake on the talk show, where he is talking about a new film in the universe where Sam Lake is playing as Alex Casey, a fictional detective from Alan Wakes books about a character of the same name, and in the "real world" outside of the dark place, there is a FBI agent called Alex Casey, coincidentally sharing the name of Alan Wakes character, and has engaged in similar stories as Alan Wakes character in the book, and the dark place. It's all an interconnected mess where it is all paradoxically connected where we don't know what is the genesis, which came first the chicken or the egg? Also Alan Wake shares the Dark Place with a poet called Thomas Zane, who ended up in there in a similar way as Alan Wake. There's a weird connection I think in the AWE dlc of Control where Thomas Zane is talking to Alan Wake, and they look the same, maybe they're the same person paradoxically too. There's already a paradox in the story where Thomas Zane went to the dark place in the 70's, but wrote about Alan Wake and his story, and Alan Wake has written about Thomas Zane, we don't know who wrote who into reality, and we may not know.

```ad-quote
“Stephen King once wrote, “Nightmares exist outside of logic, and there’s little fun to be had in explanations; they’re antithetical to the poetry of fear.” In a horror story, the victim keeps asking why - but there can be no explanation, and there shouldn’t be one. The unanswered mystery is what stays with us the longest, and it’s what we’ll remember in the end.”

*- Alan Wake*
```

Anyway this is all to mention the way in which these creators of art, mix themselves in with their art, making alternate personas or alter egos, and using them as the basis of their art.
Daniel Dumile is much more known as MF DOOM, so that his real name is known by a much smaller population. And he wears the mask so that his real face isn't even the one people know about. Sure you could probably find it, but there's no need, there's a separation of the character and the artist.
Sam Lake takes a different approach where he puts his face out there as characters. But it's still basically the other side of the same coin. Inserting yourself into your art.

Alan Wake does this in his games, because the autofiction he writes come true within the Dark Place. Maybe there's some truth to this also? Enough to motivate me to undertake this project.

### Alter Ego Ideas of My Own
I came up with a name of **Daniel Domino**. This is inspired by Dean Domino from FNV Sierra Madre and the Daniel comes from Daniel Dumile, an inspiration for the alter ego project at all. Can still be tweaked but this is a nice name to begin with. The Domino also parallels Di Iorio nicely, inspired partly by Sam Lake creating Alan Wake, very similar to his real name but very much distinct.
This might be a base level Alter Ego, I like the idea that it's tiered almost as Jack Di Iorio is the top, obviously, but the hidden author behind other characters, Daniel Domino could be the fictional top, with other alters coming down from him. Perhaps rebranding my online personas as this top ego. Instagram, Facebook, Youtube, who knows, should any of these be Jack Di Iorio, or should they be various characters of their own?
**A mask**. A mask seems like a really good idea, especially if I want to keep the Jack Di Iorio persona hidden for the most part. If we want the other personas to be the bigger personas, then hiding Jack's real face would be a good way to go about it. The same way MF DOOM did it. And Dr Doom from the Fantastic 4, which was the inspiration for DOOM in the first place. There's also the option of using an alter ego name to attach Jacks face to, so that it will be co opted by the new name instead of the real name, Jack.
- **Dex/Dexter Domino**
	- DEX, XED, D Domino, DD, Xedd some kind of online alter ego of the individual Dex Domino
	- Really play into some kind of Comic Book character. It's so on the nose kind of tongue and cheek that it's really funny while still portraying a kind of serious story that is actually taking place. Comic book character type background that leads into alter egos that play a really fun character.
	- Eg. Doctor Doom, being the alias of Viktor Von Doom.
	- Dexter Domino creating an alias that is something like DEX, or XEDD, or DD, or Xedd makes sense in a kind of edgy teen boy way. *This is sounding increasingly less cool as I describe it, but try it*
	- Increasingly thinking of magick and considering my forte in magick, maybe something like dr strange would be good. MF DOOM is Dr Doom, a Dr Strange parallel could be cool, and also a nod to MF DOOM

### Uses of Masks
Masks have always been a great tool for fictional personas and movements in any media I can think of. Darth Vader is as intimidating as he is because of the mask and suit. He is an example too of a new name and appearance being applied to an existing one in order to make the old persona forgotten. To kill the old person, and make something new.

```ad-note
"Kill old Jack, let new Jack rise from the ashes"
This is something I wrote on my bedroom whiteboard the other night and seems coincidentally relevant to the current conversation. Interesting
```

Fsociety in Mr robot has a masked character as the figurehead of their movement. A mask that is adopted and worn by their supporters during the movement too. Obviously this is inspired by the Zoro mask from V for Vendetta (A movie we've not seen but need to watch), and the mask being worn by the Anonymous hacker group through the 2010's.
The Joker doesn't don a mask, but similarly created a new persona, one which has taken over and the true identify of the joker is mostly unknown and unimportant. The new character is the Joker. Using the makeup as a type of mask, to create a character that is more than just human. It creates a symbol.
All of these types of masks and characters become more than just a man, they become symbolic. Through the likes of Carl Jung and human myth etc, we know how useful symbols are to the human psyche. Look at modern advertising and companies use of symbols. It brainwashes us, it's a stand in for a human. The symbol creates something more, something akin to a god. A culture, a power, a force. McDonalds cannot be held responsible for something an individual or individuals do within the company, because McDonalds is more than just the sum total of it's parts. It's a brand. It is a magical force. All brands are.
Using a mask and symbols are the way to elevate beyond humanity, to create something more than human.

```ad-quote
"A story is not a machine that does what you tell it. A story is a beast with a life of its own. You can create it, shape it, but as the story grows, it starts wanting things of its own. Change one thing, and you set off a chain reaction of events that spreads through the whole thing. The characters have to be true to themselves. The events need to follow a logic that fits the story. A single flaw and the magic is gone. The story dies. Alice dies."

### Archetypal Figures
There are some archetypal figures I want to use as inspiration for creating characters and personas.
- A Wizard
- A Trickster / Jester "Entertaining the Masses"
- A Skeptic
- The Light vs Darkness / Good vs Evil
- The evil twin (Mr Scratch)

## Vivaelipsis
This is a project I've come across on the internet that undertakes a similar goal. A mixed reality Alternate Reality Game (ARG). It's a very compelling and intriguing project that caught my interest too. I haven't delved too deep, but it is very inspiring and can be a basis for a project of my own
An ARG, mixed reality, autofiction experience.

## Cosmic Horror
I've come to think that the reality we actually live in is much closer to a story of cosmic horror, in such a way that it's inconceivable to even realise. This should be a strong basis of my stories. **Need to explore the King in Yellow**. This is a story of cosmic horror that I came into contact with through True Detective season 1. With Carcosa and all this cosmic horror stuff. The mystery intrigues us, brings us in, we want to know more. **Also HP Lovecraft**. If we want inspiration for cosmic horror, we gotta know about the great Lovecraft and Cthulhu and such. We even had an experience with weed where we had a brush with this idea that the term "As above, So Below", was some kind of Cthulhu esc cosmic horror name. During that experience, saying it fast felt like it was "Asabovsobelow", or "Asebov Zobellow". Idk but there's clear need for reading Lovecraft.

## Multi Media Applications
I've recently been very interested in multiple disciplines and pursuing multiple avenues of creation. Now Jack's never been too much of a creator, but we're starting to realise that there is a strong desire and NEED for creation within. The only problem is that not many forms of art and creation are very well developed within the system known as Jack.
- **Art**, actual just pieces of art, physical and digital. We know that Jack hasn't got very good artistic capability but that's no reason to not try. We want to get better, take art classes and such.
- **Writing**. This is a prospect that has recently blossomed in my mind since the Alan Wake series. Jack's brain has always been very imaginative and good at making fake realities. This is a very interesting prospect for Jack to dabble in and try out. Mixing in the autofiction and meta aspects could be a way to bypass "traditional" writing styles and techniques, since we haven't had much practice by other styles, why not try and make our own?
- **Music**. Jack thinks that despite not having any musical theory experience, just trying and experimenting with making music could be a fun experience. We know that Daniel Dumile said about writing his music that there wasn't many people out there who did the rhyming conventions he was doing. He was just doing it the best out of everyone, that mixed in with his unique style of storytelling and sampling and let's not reduce his genius, he was fantastic, but he just chose a few things and did those extremely well and in interesting ways. Just meddle with it I reckon.
- **Poetry**. This kinda goes hand in hand with the music, since we really like hip hop music and rap, getting good at poetry would probably translate well to writing lyrics and such. Need to read more poetry and get inspiration.
- **Photography**. I don't know how this can tie in nicely, but it's an avenue I'd like to explore as an artistic endeavour in my personal life and future. Maybe something like those alternate reality tik toks and instagram pages where they're making the videos from an alternate reality. There's a specific page I'm thinking of where the guy is walking around usually busy locations, but he's the only person there. His ARG is that he got transported to another reality where there is no one else, and it's just him documenting his exploration while there's other entities following him etc. Photoshop and other things to marry photography and videography into alternate reality stories seems plausible.
Essentially we just want to make a good culmination of multi media that does a good job of portraying a cohesive story of world building. VivaElipsis was set up in a way that when I first discovered it, I was unsure whether it was real or not. It was a genuine exploration into whether there is actually a digital portal to another dimension where things are different, and communication between the two and more can take place. This underground story of reality with bigger things at play. I love that. Combined with the soft soleplay of the people involved and the discord being set up as a hotel within this portal, it's just inspiring and so cool.

## Making a way This Can Entertain the Masses
The thing about such a project is there needs to be a way to get it to appeal to idiots. The masses need to be intrigued. Especially if there is to be intent, messaging and a call to action within such media. Idiots are idiots. They cannot understand such meta-fiction. There needs to be a way to reach the lowest common denominators, attract them in some way, and have the rabbit hole go deeper and deeper for those that are interested. Either that or ignore the dumb cunt's and only go for smart people that can understand such messaging.
