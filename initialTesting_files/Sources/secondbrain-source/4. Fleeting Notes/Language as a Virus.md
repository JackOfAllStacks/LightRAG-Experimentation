# Language as a Virus
This is the theory that there is something within consciousness that cannot be explained by our human language. Without human language, the very thing that makes humans human, there are no thoughts other than being.  Only when you break the being in the moment with language, is where we start understanding the world around us and encapsulating the environment around us into words made up of symbols. We find out ways to adapt to survival, but with the increased levels of cognition, the more complex the thoughts are had, and the more attachment to thoughts and less being in the moment there occurs. We have reached a time in history where the human species' survival depends on levelling up our consciousness. We must learn to put aside the ego, and live within gods world, instead of our own.

```ad-quote
The mind is an excellent servent, but a terrible master
***- David Foster Wallace***
```

We have been using the Ego as an evolutional advantage over all of history, and have finally reached the nexus point and extent of that way of living. We are at a point where the drive behind the Ego is pushing us as a species off the cliff, and something else needs to take control and either slow us down, or make a change of course.
This is hard to say whether it is entirely the Ego's fault, or whether a myriad problems with the culture we live within.

```ad-example
![[Love vs Hate Dialectics|600]]
```

In quantum mechanics, it seems as though all particles are either one, or the other until observed. They are a possibility of an outcome, until it is observed, and then there is a definitive answer of what state that part of reality was in.
Now Hypothetically, if in an infinite time, there was an occurrence where reality squeezed into a a bottleneck where all of reality as it is know came down to an observation of either one or the other. Hypothetically, it could seem like we are approaching that time, when it is either 1 or 0. The thesis of an entire perception of reality coming up against it's antithesis, where either one will win, or a synthesis is produced. A merging of both perceptions of reality into something more.

```ad-important
#### Current perception of reality + Alternate perception of reality = New Perception of reality
"Love" reality + "Hate" reality = Winner Reality
Perfect Thesis Reality + Perfect Antithesis Reality = Successful Synthesis Reality
Imperfect Thesis Reality + Imperfect Antithesis Reality = Failure Synthesis Reality
-1 + 1 = 0 (Perfect balance and equinox of reality)
-1.5 + 0.5 = -0.5 (Imperfect Balance, Skewed into a negative reality)
```

Then if we play a game that this is real, then what are the chances that the outcome of such an Equation, is a perfect synthesis? in infinity, quite low, but that shouldn't deter people from trying to increase the odds. In fact, if you're someone that realises such a thing, it is almost your duty to devote your life and work to increasing the odds, and putting as much good out there as you can.
