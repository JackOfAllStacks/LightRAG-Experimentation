# The Matrix as We Know it

### [[Mind Altering Substances]] Effects on [[Jack Di Iorio]]
Weed is a consciousness alteration device, a mind altering substance. The substance weed affects Jack in a way like none of the others I've tried have. It makes Jack freak out and imagine things that *COULD* be true. Not real, but it feels real, and Jacks brain seems to know this reality exists despite the active waking consciousness reality tunnel he views the world in. The consciousness that is attributed to weed is a major fear reaction coming along with profound "Realisations" of the world we inhabit.

### #Hypothesis Of [[Another Dimension]] within [[Jack Di Iorio]]
Jack seems to believe that he has lost touch with a part of himself that has been missing for so long that he is unaware it exists. This part may have locked within it a Holy Guardian Angel of some kind. There is some communication with something, it seems to be external by the story I tell, yet internal whenever I feel. The feeling is strong so when he feels it, he knows he is in danger. The fear response to a world he fears he lives in momentarily spooks his subconscious so bad that he refuses to acknowledge it and reveal it to the main egoic Jack Persona we are in during most waking life. This waking life Jack can be called Asleep Jack, A Jack we get in contact with is some kind of Awake Jack. The proposed meta-cognition is that Asleep Jack gets in touch with another part of his intelligence while high and gets freaked out by a crossed section part of reality where a terrifying conspiracy is true. All physical evidence proposed against it can be refuted as the idea of coming up with it and believing the paranoid delusion instead of meta-cognizing the feelings and thoughts will lead to psychosis. Jack brushes with a sudden extreme psychotic(We use psychotic not to connotate the feeling of being a psycho or a schizophrenic, but a drastically illusioned view of reality that we feel to know is the truth, but not wanting to accept it) experience where his thoughts and physical body have an overwhelming fear response to the point that Jack feels like he will have a heart attack or an alien burst out of his chest. There is now evidence of unnecessary elevated heart rate on multiple occasions of brush against the psychotic experiences. Enough to trust the evidence that whatever this is, it is real enough to push my body to the verge of death through the traumatic fear response. This panic attack only lasts as long as you give into a very primal instinct to stay alive. Thoughts and feelings that you are living in a horror world, a continued delusion that is also taken into waking consciousness as a secret and ashamed guilty pleasure to share with people and explain these beliefs. So he continues to read into his reality and continue to find input that attributes to the brain that allows a secret inkling of a belief  to be validated. This continued delusion and belief that is kept secret still drives Jack's life. It needs to be faced soon, else it tears me apart.

## [[The Crazy Conspiracy]]
This is the crazy conspiracy that is somehow paradoxically believed to be true and untrue within Jacks mind. In a state of paradox, Jack chooses to hide and retreat from this paradox of nature that is within him, a belief that he believes in deep down, so deep that he convinces himself he doesn't believe it. This urge within me, or help from without me, Jack continues to leave a sad existence pretending he doesn't believe this reality, but some force driving to find connections to dots and proof that may help the case that this is the reality. A deep desire to prove correct, and a surface value desire to pretend it's not true.

## [[The Myth]]
The myth is an interpretation of the archetype enforcing their will within Jack and externally of Jack. There is a very Archetypal story that can be seen in this delusion. With a specific lens and view of reality, one is able to skirt all the way around this delusion without falling in. The new reality is that anything is possible, and that the true verifiable reality may or may not exist. Through examination of reality, one is able to believe in a strong grounded sense of reality, anchor themselves to it and go around questioning every thought and belief he was thought he had, until you cannot deny any sense of reality to be truly *"real"*. This is when you keep peeling layers off of reality that you feel a sense that there *IS* some true knowable reality, and that ones duty is to serve the quest to find it. Knowing that most likely you won't find it, but there is a *belief* and hope that one may be the one to find it.
It's the lottery paradox. The odds of winning that lottery are so low, so that statistically there is no hope of thinking you will be the one to win it. Yet, one person does have to. Someone does win.
Jack has long wondered what the second coming of Jesus might feel about himself, may he discount the idea as so far fetched that he doesn't pursue the idea of being Jesus? Well if he truly was the second coming of Christ he would have no option to not believe in himself and trust that he is the one.
This is a dangerous analogy, I know.
But the point is that Jack doesn't truly believe that he is the second coming of Christ by using this analogy, but that the reality doesn't really matter.
Now Jack is capable of driving in any direction on the road and progress is progress. It does not matter what the reality of a situation is, but belief that the situation could be otherwise is now a driving force into manifesting anything you truly set your mind to.

## The Matrix
The Matrix is a term for the net of the universe that we inhabit as 3 Dimensional beings. The web of consciousness that underlays all matter and in fact all of reality. This is the force that allows synchronicities to happen. The inexplicable reason for archetypes, spirits, magic, god/s, entities, aliens. The reason that despite being provable in their existence, the stories continue on. These are all from another dimension of reality that we have participated in for most of human history. Yet these times, most of waking consciousness on planet earth is sleepwalking.
