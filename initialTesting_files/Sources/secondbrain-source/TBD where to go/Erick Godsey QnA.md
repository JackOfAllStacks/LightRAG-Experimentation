Death cookie is doing your the thing you most don't want to do. Do what doesn't feel good.

Who you are is always smaller than what you could be, and who you could be is going to take stepping outside of your comfort zone and doing what you haven't.

Go for a walk and talk to yourself like a stern mentor. flipping between the child whingey "I can't do it" mind and the "of course you can" eg. "I hear you, I understand, but you can do it, I'll help you do it, here's the time and how to do it, now let's do it"

Pain in our life has to get to a point where we have to intentionally push ourselves into the the pain to do the stuff. The vow. The nonnegotiable vow to do the thing.

Dharma is living in tune with your true authentic self and what you're meant to be doing. You can be washing the dishes and be in your Dharma.

Deep focus max is about 4 hours a day.

death cookies have a spectrum. on the low end there is the boring mundane things that need doing. as you go further on the specctrum you deal with hard truths to yourself that you need to face. things you don't want to do that need to be done. not as in chorse, but just being honest with yourself, and the more brutally honest you can be the more of an honest death cookie you will get.
