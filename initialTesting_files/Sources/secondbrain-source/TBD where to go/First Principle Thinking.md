# First Principle Thinking
Sometimes called "Reasoning from First Principles", it is the practice of question every assumption you think you know about a problem, and creating new solutions from scratch

A basketball coach for example will combine the basic rules of basketball with the capabilities of their players to create entirely new ways for their team to play. Because the coach understands the **first principles** that built the play, they are able to identify what was successful and what wasn't.

First Principle thinking seems to be about having a fundamental enough knowledge of the underlying principles of a concept, which allows you to have a greater understanding of the concepts when attributed to any area of field or situation.

Think of someone understanding what an oak tree is and the kind of knowledge that person might have, versus someone that has a more basic fundamental knowledge about an acorn and the process that an acorn undertakes and **turns into** a tree. Someone who just knows the knowledge and concept of an oak tree might struggle more to identify why an oak tree grew the way it did, compared to someone that knows the first principles of an acorn and process that an acorn turns into a tree, would.  **This is First Principle Thinking**

### Reasoning by Analogy Vs First Principle Thinking
First principle thinking requires you to *break down* previous assumptions of problems to create a completely knew innovative solution.

Reasoning by analogy is solving problems *based on* prior assumptions and widely accepted best practices.

Eg. A Chef that uses first principle thinking will use his knowledge of raw materials (*first principles*) to create totally new dishes. Someone that hasn't got first principle thinking or knowledge of the raw ingredients, will instead likely follow the instructions of a recipe, barely deviating from the widely accepted instructions. Both of these dishes will (probably) result in a good meal, but only one will be unique and assembled in a way never done before.

### Techniques to Establish First Principles
Easy to define, hard to implement.

#### 1. Socratic Questioning
The Socratic Method is a systematic approach to asking and answering questions. The goal is to inspire creativity and separate knowledge from false assumptions. Generally follows this process:
1. **Clarify your thinking and explain the origin of your ideas.** Why do I think this? Have I always felt this way?
2. **Challenge assumptions.** How do I know this is true? What if I thought opposite?
3. **Look for evidence.** What is one example? What other information do we need?
4. **Consider alternative perspectives.** How would others respond? Do I know I'm correct?
5. **Examine consequences and implications.** What if I am wrong? What Are the consequences if I am?
6. **Question the original questions.** Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from this process?

#### 2. The Five Whys
Children often show us an example of **first principle thinking** with their incessant "why" questioning. Adults may be irritated by this, but there is a lesson to be learnt here. Think of the example of a parent trying to get their kid to bed:

"It's time to get ready for bed."
*"Why?"*
"Because our bodies require sleep."
*"Why do we need sleep?"*
"Because if we never slept, we'd die."
*"Why would that make us die?"*
"I don't know; let's look into it."

You can break down problems and processes the same way. Eventually you will arrive at a question you cannot answer, and this is where you develop a new solution.

#### 3.Elon Musk's Three Steps
Elon musk has become a well-known advocate for first principles thinking. Many of "his" innovations have come as a result of this. Here are his three steps:
1. Identify and define your current assumptions.
	- Eg. Growing my business will be too expensive
2. Break down the problem into its fundamental principles.
	- Eg. What do you need to grow a profitable business? I need to sell products or services to more customers. Does it have to cost a lot of money to sell to new customers? Not if I can access these new customers inexpensively. Who has this access and how can I create a win-win deal?
3. Create new solutions from scratch.
	- Eg. I could partner with other businesses that serve the same customer and split the profits
