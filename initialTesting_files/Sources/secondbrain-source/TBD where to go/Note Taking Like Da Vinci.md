- Don't just write down day's obligations and chores
- Think bigger picture, think of things I want to learn and places you can learn them from. eg. friend or acquaintance, mentor or just websites on the internet
- Questions don't need to be for any work, just use curiosity to foster questions
- What interests you? write those down and follow those interests
- Carry a notebook
	- write everything down
	- have an idea? meet someone new? hear something interesting? Write them down
	- If you don't write something down, you will forget it
- Set goals, no matter how big. Leonardo set big goals in many fields, all of varying sizes
- Don't pigeon hole yourself, you don't need to choose anything, do it all
- Don't let the confines of the medium you use to note take limit you. Leonardo would just use paper sheets, and organise(?) it later
- Like everything, don't let perfect be the enemy of good

# Biggest Takeaway is to Never Stop Being Curious
