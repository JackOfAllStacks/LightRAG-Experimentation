# Conceptual Note Taking
From video [How to achieve more while studying less - Obsidian & Conceptual Notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYJsGksojms&list=WL&index=17)

- Sit back and listen to information and figure out what is Unimportant, Self Explanatory, Easy enough to remember
- Don't need to test every bit of information against U S E, just trust yourself with information you think needs to be written down or not
- Sit back and listen
- Make notes for new concepts
- Go back and add to existing notes for old concepts
- Link related ideas together
- Avoid temptation to clump all information together and make it as atomic as possible
- Instead of writing notes sequentially (Like I'm doing now) write them conceptually

### School
- Promote Active Learning (learning happens in class, not at home)
- Questions come up in real time

### Old Notes
- Old notes can provide frameworks to aid learning new concepts
- No re-taking old notes on things you forgot
- Old notes *grow* over time
- Encourages **[[First Principle Thinking]]**

### The Power of Linking
- Avoids arbitrarily limiting your thinking to *[[Disciplines]]*
- Encourages **invention**, rather than *regurgitation*
- Your notes are linked in a way that makes sense to *you*

### Fluid Notes
- Write, rewrites, link, relink, merge, split and clarify with ease
- Your knowledge is constantly **changing**, but your sequential notes will *always stay the same*

Painting analogy
Gaps in your knowledge ruin the flow of creativity. An artist trying to paint but constantly having to run to the supplies room to grab a colour and then run back to the easel is going to ruin the artists flow and creativity. If only they had all the colours next to them as they were painting
- Stories are fleeting, Concepts stick

The goal of life isn't to learn as much as possible, it's to do as much as possible
More doing, less studying

## Tips
Personal Knowledge Management system or PKM (I'm using Obsidian)
- It's not about figuring what to remember, it's about figuring you don't have to remember
- Don't need to remember dates, appointment times and to do's
	- Get a calendaring program or moleskin notebook and tell yourself you're going to forget them
