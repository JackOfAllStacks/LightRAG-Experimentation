# Disciplines
The universe is not made up of multiple individual disciplines such as; Biology, Physics, History, Mathematics etc.
But instead there are many concepts out the all related to each other in some way or another.
We learn in school about such concepts in regards to certain disciplines, but don't get it confused that said concept is exclusive to that discipline.
Eg. You might get taught about about Leonardo Da Vinci in history, but that doesn't limit Da Vinci to a topic of the history discipline exclusively. It's merely a concept that can be spoken about in regards to the concept of history, or mathematics, or art etc.
