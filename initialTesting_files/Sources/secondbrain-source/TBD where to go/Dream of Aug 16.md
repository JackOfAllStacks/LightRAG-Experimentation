# Dream of Aug 16
Its Friday august 16, now 2 am in the morning.
I've awoken from visions, visions and stories. Every story told has had memetic messages that have needed to be passed on to me.
It's not a coincidence that I'm playing outlast trials and Alan wake 2 atm.
Alan wake has been one of the most consequential game series I've ever played already, 2 weeks and that's it. My life is that of the writer Alan wake. I am also Thomas Zane. I am trapped within the dark place trying to write me a story out.
I had a dream and a vision of being in darkness with all of this visual noise around me, but it was all information. It was all words. Words waiting there for me to write down and create reality with it. I can experience this liminal space between dreaming and being awake where the creativity and imagination is unstoppable. Stories flow through my mind, I just can't pay enough attention to capture anything. If you focus too hard you can't pick up the different stories being told. And if you listen for the stories being told then you struggle to bring them with you into the waking world.
I just got obsidian sync so that I may be able to write down my dreams easier.

Even now I cannot write down the dreams and visions I was having in the profound sense they deserve. Only while my eyes are closed can I experience it.
