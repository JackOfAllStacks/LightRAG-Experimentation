# Obsidian
**Obsidian** is the application I am learning and using to create my second brain. It is the application that is being used right now to read this. This is an [[PARA Method - Area|Area (PARA)]] note used to index all resources belonging to this [[PARA Method - Area|Area (PARA)]].

# Resources
```dataview

from [[]] and #resource 
sort file.name asc
```
