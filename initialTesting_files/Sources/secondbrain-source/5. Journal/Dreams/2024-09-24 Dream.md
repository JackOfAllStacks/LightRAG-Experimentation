# Dream from Tuesday, 24th of September, 2024
I had a few dreams last night that came back to me when I awoke.
I remember being back at [[Flinders Christian Community College]] and needing to get a key from [[Mr Penecuik]] to get access to a certain room. I was really feeling like I was back in the school situation again, surrounded by all the peers I remember being with.

I remember another dream where I was speaking to [[Chloe Pomphrey]]. I think that popped up because I saw her mum at [[Private Seas Wellness Centre]] last time I had a float session. I assumed she works there. I also for some reason had a little look at [[Chloe Pomphrey|Chloe]]'s Instagram account yesterday(?) so somehow she's been on my mind and showed up in my dream.
