# Dream from Sunday, 15th of September, 2024
I lost a lot of the dream last night. But I remember that I'm getting closer to becoming lucid.
I remember being chased by people, there was almost like a zone or a circle in which I was being hunted in, I guess I was trying to get out. Almost like a last known location in a video game like Grand Theft Auto or the like. I do remember a point in which I was in a car that stopped or stopped working or something, and another car pulled up with someone inside that was chasing me. That's when a part of me remembered it was a dream and told myself to take control. I told the guy who got out of the car to stop right there, and let me take his car without doing anything. I think he just froze and let me do what I said.
I woke up feeling annoyed and excited that I'm getting closer to becoming lucid in my dreams.
