# Dream from Saturday, 7th of September, 2024
I've been having restless sleeps lately. Well I've been getting good rest, but my body has been all over the place, struggling to be fully comfortable. By sheets and doona and pillows have been all over the place when I wake up. Last night was no exception.

I had spiritual dreams. Not "dreams" per say, but experiences. I was being shown my different states of being, and different parts of myself. I remember seeing and experiencing three different states.
One was my earth-spirit, another was my mind-spirit. And there was a third that I cannot remember now. But I felt like I was lucid all night, experiencing in this different realm. I woke up, and despite feeling like I was a degree of lucid throughout the experiences, most of it still fell out of my head as I woke up.
