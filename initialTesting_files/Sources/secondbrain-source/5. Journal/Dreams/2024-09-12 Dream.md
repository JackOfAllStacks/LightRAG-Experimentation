# Dream from Thursday, 12th of September, 2024
I has a dream with Larry David and Cheryl from Curb Your Enthusiasm again. A dream where I was basically in an episode. I realise a dreamsign should be the people I have around me. Larry David and Cheryl are obviously not people in my real life, so I should see them and know that I'm dreaming. Add this to list of dreamsigns.

I remember saying a joke, and Cheryl and Larry looking at me and saying something like "You know people are lucky to have someone like you in their life, you light up the lives of those you touch". Something to that effect that touched me. It felt like my subconscious reminding me that the way I have been treated in the past, is not indicative of me, but of them. And that truly, people should be lucky to have you in their life.

I just remembered another dream from my sleep. It was with mils in an outlast trials esc dream again

I just remembered another one. I got a message that was some kind of gobbly de gook, I remember because I was going to respond with "No, but I did hear about Hector getting the 13 minute glepnir on weaver". No idea what to make from that dream though.
