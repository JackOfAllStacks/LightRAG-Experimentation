# Dream from Monday, 9th of September, 2024
Woke from a dream that I barely remembered. Except that I'm trying to get back home. Trying to reach somewhere I've already been. Somewhere I'm from. Like the magician blind of using woman as analogy to get back to God. I'm trying to get back home. That's about all I remember. It's about all that's important.
