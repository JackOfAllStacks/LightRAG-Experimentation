# Dream from Monday, 16th of September, 2024
I have a few fragments of dreams from last night.
I remember XRP shooting to crazy prices and I was horribly depressed and upset that I was watching it happen all in real time while I no longer had 15 grand invested in it.

I remember talking to [[Ella Mculloch]] over the phone about something for some reason, for quite an extended piece of time. I remember thinking it was weird and not wanting to bring up my recent dreams that have featured [[Shannan Hebaiter]].

I think this was another later part of the [[Ella Mculloch]] dream, but we ended up going to [[Jerimiah Wheelan]]'s house in Tyabb for a huge house party.
