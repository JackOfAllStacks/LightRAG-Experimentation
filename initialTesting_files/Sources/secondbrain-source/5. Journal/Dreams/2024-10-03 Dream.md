# Dream from Thursday, 3rd of October, 2024
I woke up remembering something about messaging Shannan again and being ridiculed by her for doing so. Like it was an outlandish thing to do, despite not feeling like it was.
In waking consciousness obviously I can see why I shouldn't do it and why I would receive that kind of response. But again, this dream was tied up in the other dreams I've had featuring Shannan. I remember in the dream thinking why was that the reaction, we've already been in contact and hanging out again since we broke up. I was merely asking to talk to each other again, and that was it. But obviously I was confused and connecting the storylines from other dreams into this one.
There has been no contact with Shannan in real life in a long time, and I do not wish there to be. But my dreams tell other stories and confuse me.
I think this dream was a communication of sorts that was referencing Mils. I should not contact her again, despite me feeling otherwise. This dream says as much.
