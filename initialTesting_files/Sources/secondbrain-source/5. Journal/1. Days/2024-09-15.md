## Today's Dream - [[2024-09-15 Dream]]

# Notes from the Day
10:56 - I woke up earlier and played some Outlast Trials because I didn't get the dailies done yesterday and they refresh at 10.
Now I've had a coffee and want to work on [[Obsidian]] some more.

12:21 - I'm getting annoyed at this [[PARA Method - Project]]. I have the graph view open and I'm not liking the way the [[Project - Setting Up Obsidian]] is linking to the actual files of my vault. I think I want them linking to some kind of "proxy" files that are a stand in for discussion and ease of understanding of the [[PARA Method - Project]], without them linking to the real files of my vault.
Example. When discussing about the [[PARA Method - Area|Areas]] of the vault, they are linking to the real [[My Areas]]. Then again I don't think I actually want this linking to it either, because then that's tainting the links it has? I'm not sure. I just think I need to finish it all before I start cleaning it up.

Maybe I'm not meant to worry about the links in the graph view? It's just a going to be a messy visualisation of the vault after all. Perhaps I just need to worry about the functionality of of it all and not the way the graph looks. ugh. This is doing my head in and I cannot wait for it to be done.
