## Today's Dream - [[2024-10-18 Dream]]

# Notes from the Day
12:54 - Need to note stuff I've been doing this work to send to Hiba and also prepare for Monday morning's Start Up

23:52 - I had a gummy earlier from dad, this one i asked about and didn't pinch. Watched The Spaceman and wrote stories with ChatGPT. Just put on Dream Scenario, notices it's an a24 film and got excited, and then perturbed by the Saturn films. Saturn is very symbolic and conjures images in my mind.
