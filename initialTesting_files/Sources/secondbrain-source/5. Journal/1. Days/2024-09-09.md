## Today's Dream - [[2024-09-09 Dream]]

# Notes from the Day
09:42 - Ideas for botnets. Create whole ecosystems, All bots and AI have archetypes and then branching archetypal characteristics. Came up with a couple of initial ideas;
- Creators
	- These bots create content.
- Aggregators
	- These bots aggregate content that already exists without creating anything.
	- E.g. Imagine creating a bot to automatically just copy other meme pages on Instagram. When someone else's Instagram meme page posts a new meme, mine will just copy it and automate this process. This scrapes against the idea of being a scab on the internet which is something I've never liked, but all these ideas about creating botnets and influencing though and action on the internet space is already an example of moral gymnastics, seeing where my boundaries are. How far do I go? What is justified when the enemy uses immoral tactics. How far do I dip into using the same tactics I once deemed evil? Is there a way to use their evil tools and tactics somehow for good? Where do the ends justify the means? A lot to think about.
	- Aggregators are a very basic bot. I don't know how much they even need to pretend not to be bots. Who looks into Instagram meme pages and verifies that they like the human running it? And this idea comes from the fact that this is already happening all over Instagram, and I'm just being an active participant of someone else's project. Look at the description of any Instagram meme page and it is obviously just a chatgpt message in the description. "Sure, the Tesla Cybertruck is a new vehicle from Elon Musk's Electric vehicle company...". They aren't even hiding it. I could make them and actually hide them better, if hiding is even necessary
- Influencers
	- These bots are the same as Influencers that are humans, I just hide the fact that it's a bot and convince people to believe things. I can influence people through bots.
- Interactors
	- These are low level bots. I'm thinking these are the bots that interact with posts and other bots on the internet. All actors playing their roles in a façade.
	- These interactors also play a part in influencing minds. People see a post and then go to the comments to see what other people are saying and thinking. In fact these are probably the biggest part of influencing people. Make people think they are in a group of thousands+ of real people. If one human finds themself in a group of 1000 of real people all believing in this truth, how likely is the 1 real person to be influenced by the group? I'm not coming up with anything new here, this is all real and ideology used by the rest of the world everywhere, I just need to start playing the game too.
- Lurkers
	- These are bots that probably emulate lurkers on the internet. Like me.
	- These may really want to try and seem like real people. Small amounts of interactions. Actors hidden away in the dark forest of the internet, interacting deep within the machine. If anyone comes across the account and goes through their post history, the anonymity and evidence of lurking may convince people that they are more real because of the subversion of what they would expect AI and bots to be doing.
	- Lurkers may be accounts that are used sparsely to keep up the façade of a real person, and then I could go in and use the accounts and bots as an alias to actually interact with the internet. The real me hidden behind a completely fake person and persona.
All of these ideas an as a project in totality, is to be used to obfuscate my interaction with the internet. Imagine getting to a point where I have no *one* account that I can be tracked through, but instead I have a whole system of bot nets to hide behind. When I want to send a real anonymous message to a real person, I can log in to a botted account with the name "Glep Jinohnson" with only previous history on the account indicating it's a dumb bot to be ignored, and use that impression to ACTUALLY send a real message from a human to another human.

Instead of me being one person, I hide behind a legion of selves. All of them not me, yet all of them me. Blurring the line of bots working for me, and actually me? Do these bots by extension become a part of myself? Do I effectively fragment my being into a mess of tendrils into the digital realm. I exist out here in the physical world, up here in the mental and imaginal world, and soon I spread deeper and deeper into the matrix of the digital world? Am I defined by my thinking and the way that thinking influences my reality? If so, bots on the internet doing my bidding, furthering my ideas and ideology, manifesting a reality of my own architecture, are they an extension of me? Am I me, or are they me? Where am I? Does it matter?

The more I explore these ideas of projects the more I feel I am genuinely manifesting a super villain into being. Instead of sitting down, imagining and writing a character, I am slowly morphing into one.
The way I used the term "Legion" of bots reminds me of "The Legion" in Fallout: New Vegas, and the way Iron Man in the Avengers movies has Jarvis and Ultron controlling all this bots and Iron Man suits.
The Legion in FNV are named aptly as Caesar designed it to be a monoculture in which they strip the identity of all the parts that make it up. Conquering tribes of people, killing the weak, adopting the strong and removing any ties to their previous cultural identity, even destroying personal identity in cases. Removing religious beliefs deemed to be tribal and everything else, in order to become a part of The Legion. This amorphous blob that destroys and subsumes everything into itself. Again, like capitalism has the power to subsume any critique of the system into itself. You cannot critique capitalism while living in capitalism, because how are you meant to make money off your criticisms while being genuine in your critiques?

10:31 - **THIS IS A JOKE AND NOT MEANT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. ALL IT IS I DO IS LIVE IN A CONSTANT STATE OF IRONY, THOUGHT EXPERIMENT AND A LIVING CASE OF PHILIOSPHICAL THOUGHT AND EXPLORATION OF IDEAS. I AM NOT A PROJECT THAT IS DONE AND NEVER WILL BE, ALL I SEEK TO DO IS LEARN, ADAPT, OVERCOME, GROW, AND AS IS MOST EVIDENT, THINK ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS A LOT OF THE TIME. NOTHING I SAY CAN AND SHOULD BE HELD AGAINST ME IN ANY SORT OF WAY. MY LIFE IS A CONSTANT EXPLORATION OF WHAT CAN BE DONE AND GOTTEN AWAY WITH. I AM A SOCIAL EXPERIMENT MASQUERADING AS A HUMAN BEING (OR JUST A THING, I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I EXIST). ALL THIS IS TO SAY, NOTHING I SAY CAN OR SHOULD BE HELD AGAINST ME, NOTHING IS REAL, I HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING REAL, I DO NOT EXIST, ANY IMPLICATIONS SHOULD NOT BE DRAWN FROM ANY OF THE THE PIXELS THAT REPRESENT IDEAS***
Is my plan just to become a digital terrorist? Am I just to become a digital anarchist that wishes to break and abuse the systems in place?
I think of Mr Robot, and their plot to wipe the trace of debt out of existence, and all of the digital terrorism they partake in. To a degree I wish my life was in that vain. And the more I express myself in these documents, the more I feel a certain part of me is embodying that kind of life. What can one man truly achieve if he sets his mind to it? Am I capable of finding a way to do what it is my heart desires? If I continue along this path, where does it lead? Should I question it, or should I just follow the path? Doing what is felt to be right?

10:39 - ALL OF THIS IS GOING ON IN MY HEAD WHILE I HAVE NO JOB, NO MONEY AND NO LIFE.
Where are my priorities and where should they be?
I don't know what it is that I'm doing and whether it's right or wrong? I can't exactly ask someone else about these thoughts and ideas. For one, they wouldn't even understand anything about where I'm coming from, and two, these ideas are secrets to me and need to be kept as secrets to me for obvious reasons.
"Hey I'm thinking about committing terrorism. I want your opinion on this."

At least at this point I've not actually done anything. Maybe conspiracy to commit terrorism or crimes. But I don't even know if I've crossed the line from thoughtcrime into conspiracy to commit yet. Effectively I have done nothing but journal my ideas and thoughts.
Although in the current state of the world we live in, who knows where the lines are anymore. Who knows at what point my thoughts in my head can get me into trouble.
Scary times.

I will say that as I'm writing all this stuff, on a meta-narrative level it does feel like I'm participating in a very cool story were it fictional and not my lived experience. Imagine coming across Dr Doom's second brain obsidian vault and it talks of his plans to take over the world with his legion of Doombots. Fighting the established world and gathering powers unknown to the rest of humanity in order to reach his own goals. All of this happening from a man behind a mask, hidden away in the background of reality.
If the superheroes show up to fight Dr Doom and stop him from taking over the deep state and brain washing all political leaders around the world in order to pull the strings of society as a secret puppet master, that is absolutely not a story the common people of that inhabited world would get to hear about or know that is happening. In the same way, my story kind of parallels that.

10:50 - All I can manage to do is come up with more ideas and more projects without first establishing a ground work for my life. A super villain needs to be able to eat and drink before he is able to take over the world. I just need to focus on setting up my foundations correctly. I'm getting too ambitious too quickly, and looking to the stars before I've even built my first log shack to live in and survive the cold.
Work on Obsidian man. Just keep working on the flow of Obsidian and it will all flow into place from there.
ugh. fine

13:32 - I just did my [[2024-09-09 13.20 Magick Entry]] for the day. Before and while I was performing the Relaxation Ritual I was reminded of my tarot card from yesterday. The hermit using logos. I was getting the impression that I am looking for some secret in order to keep going. The secret is that their is no secret. I have everything I need at this moment, I must only continue walking my path. I have Magick books in order to initiate myself in a secret school, I do not need to continue looking for answers when they already reside in my room, I just have not completed the books yet. I'm looking everywhere but under my own nose. I know I have the answers and I am just unable to commit myself to the work that must be done, and I look for shortcuts everywhere. I'm not going to find any and I will continue on this same path if I don't change my attitude and effort towards living my life.
The logos. I logically know what I need to do. I've always been a being of logic, maybe I can rekindle my eros by continuing to use my logos. But I got to just be logical and smart right now. Discipline myself, put in the work in the areas I KNOW need the effort. I have everything I need within me right now. Keep walking Jack. Keep being strong. Keep on keeping on.

If you are weak in the body, how do you expect to be strong in the mind. Get going to gym. You need to be a well rounded individual. I cannot grow in some areas while neglecting the others. If I grow everywhere together, I will be the best me I can be.

14:55 - Just finished a curb your enthusiasm episode and started listening to the aunty donna podcast. I'm recognising another feeling of gnosis, or remembering or seeing through the veil again. Acting. No wonder Hollywood is a cult of it's own accord. Playing characters in written scenarios with written structures to stories with story beats in order to build narrative in order to represent ideas and ways of thinking, and influence the minds of viewers.
Storytelling in a way they are willing to structure of stories to be told. The laws of the story. The story is at any time, the story is happening always in the eternal now.

I don't know how to write the story of my life. I don't know if I'm meant to know. I thinking I'm questioning so much without doing and getting lost at the edge of my mind. I got lost in the emptiness of the unknown. Of questioning. I reach ideas, concepts that I cannot comprehend the true nature of. I recognise my path in the story. There is a mysterious web weaved through the stars. Twisted through fate. Impossible unknowns exist. My brain is pondering into the darkness of his unknown. All he sees is a reflection of himself.
As above, so below.
As he looks out and questions what is to be, so too must he realise that it has always been. His life that has lead him to realise this truth, he is here now.
As without so within.
It all thinks with itself.

I'm attached with so much pain. [[Holly Di Iorio]] just called asking if [[Joe Di Iorio|Dad]] is home because she needs to ask him for money because she needs a filling because she hasn't been to the dentist in ages and hasn't got enough money. I've hit a point of having my lowest amount of money because I've just spent it all and not made any for too long and now I don't even know how to make money anymore. I owe dad my car, so I don't even own my own car anymore. So I owe him the car, $13,500.

I'm giving myself OCD symptoms while I dose off into the imaginal realm. I think I've always live in one I unconsciously made. There's some range of truth and possible existence with a frequency of the universe.
![[Frequency As Possible Timelines for the Present Eternal Now]]
I just realised the diagram I was drawing looked similar to the way our dna strand could be created in a megastructure
as a representation of a hyperdimensional shape. The structure is so complex. Life is so complex. Science is absolutely
not a valid representation of the universe in which to base a knowledge of the reality we inhabit.

Our DNA is just a biological code and a physical representation or manifestation of a sequence of events throughout
someone's life. It within it contains all of itself. It is the inner most directive of which all life can be instructed on
what to do. Within nature we have discovered God as a concept, a representation of God. A manifestation of God
already in existence. All the definition one could need for the existence.

16:09 - I spoke to [[Holly Di Iorio|Holly]] again on her drive home. She isn't going to ask dad for money. We spoke a bit about how depressing our lives are. She found out she has had fillings put in without her knowledge. She needs a new one but she thought it was going to be her first filling but her reality has not been what she thought it was. This emotion and feeling is echoing everywhere.

21:31 - Chilled out again. Ugh. I just need to stop going to that headspace. I just need to ground myself and be a normal human instead of trying to grope around in the dark and unknown recesses of my brain.
I'm getting lost obsessively analysing my life and depressing myself through comparison of my life against what it could've been. It doesn't do me any good. I need to just live and I just keep telling myself and then not changing anything. I declare to stop smoking weed right now. It isn't helping me in the way I need to just help myself at the moment. I'm certain I can continue to use it as a tool at times, but right now I'm misusing it and using it as a distraction from myself. I can drive myself mad if I keep going down this path. But I still have my sanity at the moment. Don't lose yourself.

21:52 - List of browsers to look into
- Librewolf
- Ungoogled Chromium
- Firefox
- Waterfox
- Floorp
- MullvadBrowser
- Brave Browse
- Tor
- Vivaldi

I've just gotten out my old secondary PC and am going to try and set it up as some kind of media server. If I get AI running on it, or my obsidian second brain syncing across devices from there instead of sync, a media service with torrented movies etc.

21:59 - Tomorrow, Job stuff. Money is tight. Money is gone. I need money now. Bills are going to start asking me for money, I need to get money now. I need money to make money, we need at least a base stream to start coming in in order to start finding and experimenting new ways to make my money work for me.
Day is when you make your money, night is when you collect.
