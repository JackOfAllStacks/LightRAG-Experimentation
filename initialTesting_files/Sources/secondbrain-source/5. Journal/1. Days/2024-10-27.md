## Today's Dream - [[2024-10-27 Dream]]

# Notes from the Day
21:22 - I should remind myself what it means to be awake for my reality checks. Defining being asleep, and being awake. Reminding myself not to get caught up in the illusory world. Being awake is more than having my eyes open, it's reminding myself of the true fundamental nature of reality. I must not fall into the illusion of ego and the human world. When I remind myself I am awake, I can remind myself that I am more, that there is more, that I live within a universe teeming with life all around me. Only energy exists, the physical universe is illusory. Do not get too caught up in its stories. Do not get attached to the narratives you tell yourself, instead remember that you are not the narrative, you can break free from the story if only you remain aware. You are pure awareness. Cultivate the awareness you desire and the changes will follow. You must know it until you know it in your heart. Knowing in your mind is different than knowing in your core and heart.
Live through a flowing consciousness based in your heart instead of your head.
