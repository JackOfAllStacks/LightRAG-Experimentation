## Today's Dream - [[2024-10-08 Dream]]

# Notes from the Day
15:56 - Just finished my job interview at PARC. I am so unfit it's scaring me. My health is scaring me and idk how to fix it. Need to do something about my cardiovascular health, but I need money. Need to start working out more regularly. I like the idea of being a lifeguard and using the PARC services daily for swimming. That will surely help.

Need to email Gaston / Liam at PARC my lifeguard qualifications in the form of the certificates and my working with children's check. Also need to send through 2 references, at least 1 working reference and maybe a character reference. Maybe Sarah at coles? I'll figure it out. Due by the end of this week at the latest.

Also need to submit SEAS application by Friday for uni submissions and need to finalise my uni stuff as well.

21:18 - Nothing matters as much as I think it does.
