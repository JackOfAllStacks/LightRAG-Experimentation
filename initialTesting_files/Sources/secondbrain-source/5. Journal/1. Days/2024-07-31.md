# Notes from the Day
- #focus I feel like I need some chemicals to focus my attention. Perhaps have ADHD or just some severe attentional systems control. My attention cannot focus, or I am really struggling to "Flow" with my consciousness. It's very sporadic and lose my train of thought constantly. If I were to obtain a way to enter that focused controlled "Flow state" consistently somehow, I feel I will get a lot done. I'll be unstoppable. Watch me go. Give me some caffeine perhaps, coke or speed, jeez I'll try any of them and see how I go. Unsure about prescribed medications, although I hear it makes ADHD people just focus and work. Adderall? "Normal people" get to get some kind of "high" off Adderall, like a speed type deal, but ADHD people just get to behave like normal people for a bit.
- - 18:35 Had a call from Nonna where she called asking how dad was because she hadn't heard from him, then asked about toby and if he was home, followed by if he stays home every night, then asking what I did today. I felt like she was asking because she felt something bad today, or can sense that something bad is coming the way I can.
