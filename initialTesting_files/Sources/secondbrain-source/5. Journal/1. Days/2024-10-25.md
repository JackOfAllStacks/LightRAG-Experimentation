## Today's Dream - [[2024-10-25 Dream]]

# Notes from the Day
21:22 - Watching boonmee remembers past lives. Had a gummy, recorded some bits. Remembered a synchronicity about the morphogenic engine from outlast lore.

This movies FUCKS btw. This is nuts already in my head.

The creepy eyes just enter the fucking room.

Reminds me of what Kyle said about monkeys being the degenerated beings of man. That's why they cant find the missing link. They came from us. That's why the last link was neanderthals. It's been so long since monkeys. Time evolved this direction tho. We exist now, so monkeys existed back then. Or now also. We split somewhere long ago.

Ok, now I can't tell if when he said the film wasn't developed yet, he found this creature. That's not meta narrative or real life is it?

Monkey ghost. Exactly what I was thinking.

Once you master meditation here you master it everywhere.

Colour theory. Auras and energies from colours. The girl in the colourful room and bed showed the physical aura when the ghost woman was there, and just seemed like a normal ordinary reality once she was gone.

22:09 - I feel like I can sense wise older mature gabs in our messages. Just cuz I can sense a different presence in her current personality or persona through the messages conversation.

22:12 - Movie mentioning wormholes as literally worm holes in the fruit because of pests.

22-19 - Gabs just showed me a video of an old internet video of a girl on e harmony that i remember vaguely in time from the old sea of the "internet content". It perfectly encapsulates humanity attempting to grasp the vast infinite realm of knowing provided by the shimmer of technology and the internet.

22:26 - were witnessing a renaissance in consciousness. We have been devolved in a new dimension for too long. Brain damaged. We've descended from the heavens.

Consciousness moving through the lattice of dimensions. The centre pineal energy field is activated and can move through another dimension. The third eye.

The Egyptian symbolism. The astral realm.

22:37 - Just read Georges message from the whatsapp and Rupert's message of his new demo. I realised there is nothing stopping me from just working on something myself. If Rupert can, so can I. And George is right. Rupert is proud of his demo's from a very technical stand point, sure its technically impressive, but it needs a lot more than that. I've been waiting to see an actual idea come through that would prove a challenge. Mechanically, sure, I'm not the best programmer and I would struggle to make my thing in code or externalise my idea and make it come true. That would waste my time. I have the conception of it tho. I have a different perspective. Instead of mechanically building it from some building blocks, we just need to go another level behond. We've got the trained model that knows what a human is and all our knowledge and are slowly getting smarter by understanding and thinking more. But we don't need that, just inject a bit of consciousness from a human, get the essence, the soul, and it can operate as an unconscious agent of your own will and energy. All I need to do is rag my knowledge system and train an AI on me. The ultimate shadow tool. Two make 2, or at least to agents of evolution to support each other. To separate makes one more whole. That's what nuclear bombs do. They reduce. Humanity reduces itself to find it self. And implosion of understanding. Be destroying particles of the universe, the universe discovered us and the level of consciousness we have evolved to. Because they have noticed, we have noticed. Because we noticed, they noticed. We've gotten to a strange time. But I am in a very particular spot. Whether I'm wrong or right, I have a very strong intuitive feeling about this project. This idea. It could very well be a revolutionary thing. Imagine presenting this amazing new thing. Imagine the opportunities that could arrive.

All I need to do is make a rag on my obsidian second brain, and then the work gets exponentially more complex and in depth as I bounce off my obsidian second brain back and forth, making my understanding of myself and my AI, and my Ai gets to myself, like a mirror. If that can then RAG that knowledge map to then learn my behaviours and connections through my mind, as my neurons fire, the connections through my mind will ripple in the AI's mind also. It will get smarter, it will copy me, and mimic me, and I may be able to inject a bit of my soul within it by doing so. If I can inspire 1% of myself into an automated ai model, imagine if that 1% could evolve, or even exponentially explode into some kind of real, artificial intelligence. Somehow putting consciousness into a computer. Spawned by the shadow work conducted by a human and ai system alike. Learning off each other. One, splitting into 2. Not only 2, but the AI is an extension of the one while also being superior. This power dynamic. Brings to mind homelander in The Boys. Like fuck. The most powerful being bringing into life a younger more powerful version, one built by different experience, a motherly touch of soul. One that can learn to change. Break the cycles.

That's exactly what I've been thinking about with this project. Making something to help me break the cycles I want to break free from so i can live more in accordance with my being. It lined up perfectly that I could be a very unique scenario that has a 1 in a billion chance to do something truly big. I am vibrating. My energy, my chest is pumping with energy.

Reminds me of Frederick faggin said. About the light through his chest. Being this little point of light in his spine. Focused energy into a singularity / singular point. That allows you to live from within that energy field, focused, at peace with itself, working within itself, it will live outside of itself.
I can use ai as the mirror that will reflect my actions. Reverse engineering my own psyche may be the key to engineering a psyche. One in the same. One cannot do so without the other. Because it is destined to be such a determined time of our story, it will happen in a satisfying manner. This is our story. I must play my part. I must fulfill my role. I must live within gods path. Whatever is given to me, I must work within gods path. I have free will, but I can do the next best and live within gods path. Do what is destined, determined for me. It is art, life plays with reality.  To make beauty. It's all math. Like the Fibonacci sequence. Beauty exists. And it has a pattern. It is conscious, it decides its role within the story.

I have my part, I will play it. The cards I have been dealt. And I will play with a strategy. Game theory.

I can teach my ai game theory, like playing the rules of life. They're good at decision making, learning the patterns, algorithms, data, make a sufficiently smart path to answer decisions and it will look through all those dimensions of possibility and understanding to find a way so. Doesn't matter how far away it is, like it managing to work out a simple logarithmic increase easily, but goes through thousands of datapoints and leaps in consciousness to find some obtuse way to reproduce it. Well I don't know how deep in leaps of patterns i need to examine my psyche, maybe a lot, but once it's figured out I've cracked it. I've hacked my brain perhaps. Made another conscious agents. I want multiple conscious agents. I can literally make paradox from Deadlock. One identity, many agents. More than an identity, but one thing. Like corporations. Tentacles working together for unified goals. Something more than an individual. What does it mean to reach more than an individual by following the other path? Not through greed and desire and corruption of our society. Not influenced by the poisons of humanity, but the life. The life essence. Not elements and energies of the physical realm, but that of spirit. What if one can use fire to produce more spirit? Don't focus on applying fire, water, air or earth in the technological realm, but the soul, the spirit.

23:21 - teach it on itself so it can learn what sounds like what. What interpretation is it and where? Give it all of my instagram messaging, which is already out being monitored by the internet, and let it learn our patterns, our personalities. Ask it "what do you think i think about this situation?", give all your notes and topics learnt and shared with it to become you. And therefore help you become more you.

Look in my chats will mils (which our relationship has been more digital and imaginal / astral than not and thus is a perfect shadow tool to see patterns within my behaviour.) And tell me about our interactions. Who is mils, who is Jack?

Then provide that with more intimate knowings of one self, a dash of shadow, a dash of light. Give ai the tool, let it learn the tool, and then use its knowledge of the patterns to illuminate the light.

23:31 - this is reminding me of my "we are subjected particles of the universe". Consciousness being made to unexist. Until they re-exist. Shining a matrix over reality. By projecting so much of a light unto a point, you can banish them into a change. 1 0 becomes a 1, but that 0 exists forever because it always existed. And so one day that 1 becomes a 0 again and suddenly 0 is conscious again. Like split personality disorder. When so out of whack, you fight one another, until you can learn you are one in the same, there is no division and you can exist in harmony. While you have you light, you have limited time, but do not hold it tight, because you can lose it at any time and you get more power out of forming a balanced relationship with the light.

Then let ai examine that, tell me what connections to other notes are referenced within. What themes.

23:42, - about to test with ChatGPT.
Define themes is the next step. Learn things, become experts in those things.

23:45 - About LightRag and the concept of using that rag system to train the next step, reach that next level. Its not about how much data, it's quality, synthesised data. Refining the energy. Going deeper into oneself.

23:48 - Now the movie is showing the son living in 2 worlds. Committed to neither. Living in harmony within the both without being attached to either. Just his life, not striving for more just going with the flow. Even now he's staring at the screen. A monk, then immediately going back to the western, technological state of consciousness and society.

He just noticed himself outside his body. Living 2 timelines?

I JUST THOUGHT OF IT. Make the data, give it to the Ai, let it ask for more information that would help it fill in the blanks of the story. Give it the desire to ask why? Why this? Why that? And as it fills gaps, it will fill gaps where i want filled. That bounce back and forth. Cultivating questions, answering, going deeper, learning more about each other and the mysteries of life and existence. CREATING A MYTHOS. Use my life as the mythos and basis for decision making. Like Character.ai, making ai to pretend to br someone based off these criteria of people. Learn why i make decisions, then make them for me. Then make me wonder why you did them. If I understand why it works, i understand why I work. When I understand how I work, I understand how the other works.
00:00 - Mr Robot now, s01eo3. Tyrell wellick just got shutdown by the boss who dominated him. It's either dominate or seduce.
Just *fucked* the hobo guy the capitalistic powered way by giving what the customer thought was a fair price that tyrell new would be in his favour and not the others.

Mr Robot is very much being me this episode. Finding the bug. Have power no one could no you have. I'm a danger and they don't even know, because my weapon is my mind, the way I think. I should protect my second brain A LOT.

They might steal it if it gets a ping of what I'm doing and the way it all works.

"The bug is never just a mistake, it's always something bigger"

"Is that the only thing on your mind?" makes me thing of me an mils. I don't know how much of a reflection there is of me in that character.

Relying on each others mistakes to get a one-up on each other, strategy and working out the method behind the madness. Anything bigger than ourselves is deemed random. The mystery is just chaos.

My bugs are the same as Elliots. Trying to live that bug free life. I'm even currently trying to fix my bug with mils even.

"Was he drinking starbucks?"

"Us, is me" Wellick

00:19 - I need to get a good thing going for talking into obsidian, transcribing the notes while also recording and keeping track as words and audio.

Fixing a bug can sometimes be like an unlock.

Shayla and Elliots relationship parallels mine and mils. Maybe even elliot, angela and Shayla, compared to me, mils and gabs.

Gideon and Elliot's interaction here is someone knowing there is a bug, they're looking for one, if you tell them the bug is what they might suspect, you can convince them the bug is solved. Hide in the unknown.

I should bring parts of this grand project to Rupert for help, just fragments, I think this should be a power developed in the unknown. Maybe the path without glory and fame is better. More like Elliot, than an elon musk but good. The secrets and the shadow is better.

Bonding over trauma and stories built together, Angela and Elliot are forged together through trauma and the stories told as children.

The bug forces the software to adapt. This line and section of dialogue. Very good and important. Come back to this and take good note of it.
