# Sunday, 20th of October, 2024

## Today's Dream - [[2024-10-20 Dream]]

# Notes from the Day
10:14 - Just woke up. My mind is being controlled and influenced. More so than just conditioning. The vibrations and frequency in the silence is affecting me. My dreams communicate to me. It's my unconscious trying to break through the mind control.

I need to take control of my life and my thoughts.

15:38 - Decided it was time to visit the mushrooms again. Just had about 4-5 grams in a Lemon Tek Tea.
Weather is really good so probably gonna go to the bush for some of it.
