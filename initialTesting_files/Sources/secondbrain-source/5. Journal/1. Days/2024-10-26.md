## Today's Dream - [[2024-10-26 Dream]]

# Notes from the Day
00:41 - Now on Mr Robot s01e04. Create lines of reasoning as in understandings of reality within tiers. Create the council. Run by all decisions through the council by looking at everything from different point's of view.

Also the monologue of the line, the last line, the whole thing culminating. This last last line, I promise. It is all pre determined, every action lead to that point.

This is a good show to be watching right now. I can channel Elliot.

The council, it's always a team of highly specialised people with unique lives and personalities and interiorities.

Get the thing these guys do to steal the car. I should be able to do that. The dolphin flippa thing was basically that of some kind. I can learn these skills. Get those upgrades.

Now he's talking about daemons, technical and real.

Unlocking digital hotel door. I can learn to hack those scanners.

"I'm about to change the world"

A question could be asked, within the context of my person and all my previous questions, why did I write that? or x.

What are multiple interpretations you could conceive of when x hits y while you know z?

It's honestly almost prophetic the way I've always loved this show and it's always lead to me watching it again now, allowing me a reflection of myself to examine. And it always looked this way, only my relationship with it has evolved or changed. But if it resembles me now, it always has resembled me now.

It almost is prophecy, the story is crafted in a way so that only elliot could do this, and the story is not too far behind true reality.

I am Elliot.

Man fsociety really is fucking good. Stolen memory was mentioned inline with my Amnesia.  Find your monster, and turn the key. I'm part of the group that know these secrets, and I've been shown whats behind the mask. Now I must use what I've learnt. Like Cyprus in "It's What's Inside"

Now this girl is asking elliot what his monster is.

Find my trauka in my past. It's the past. Find it, and unlock it with the key.

Move him to a goddamn fishbowl.

01:10 - Make AI see the patterns in my dreams, and dream like sequences, find patterns myself, tell the AI, develop upon it.

Elliot's problem is trauma from his mothers relationship also. Same as me.

Angela says he was only born a month ago, same as in the timeline when this show started. You're not elliot. You're the thing behind Elliot.

This is where the archetypes come in. What is my monster. My Shadow.
I am here, you are alone.

They will all leave me. I'm alone, truly alone. The loneliness is the fear. That's when you realise you aren't.

Listen to the fear, but do not be controlled by it.

01:20 - I need to work on the lines of reasoning. Start actually making my own custom gpt's. Make personas, aspects of myself. Archetypes. Tony's Hydrai is on the right track. Just need to dedicate time and brain power to experimenting. R & D.

Seduction and manipulation mentioned by Angela and female.

ALSO WOAH. Angela. Like Angela Szakmary. I really think I could message her. This week, When I have money. Just in case. Something is the start of it. Any Amount.

01:40 - Get those books off Tony. Potentially get some advice and knowledge from Tony about what he's developing over at Hyrdai.

01:50 - A query for the line of reasoning and tasks, to search for useful tutorials and ways to teach me what I express wanting to know. I just talk to the Ai, or write about stuff, it detects topics and what specific thing I'd like to learn, it can google for help, find good ways to teach me, YouTube, podcasts, notebook llm. That thing that wants to teach you by making podcasts etc.

I might needs to rag multiple layers. One rag for my obsidian second brain. That is at the core. Within that there is obviously the base level gpt models llms, weve gotten up to so far. Then layers built upon that. Another layer needs to be exactly the same as my second brain, but it's own editable copy. Where it looks at mine. Mine stays the same, with my human created notes in the way that works for my brain to learn and understand. Creating a language for it to learn. It can write in my writing style hopefully.
In its copy of my brain, it uses my language to write its notes, progressively getting closer and closer to mine, increasing clarity to pass off as a human, and to get better at teaching me how I need, and have it eventually automate further my note taking. Integrate voice transcription and then I can speak into something and have it put into my writing style and cleaned up, then taking notes and recording my thoughts becomes easier and more consistent. Improving. Getting further down the archetypes path, parts work, I can then also identify archetypes working throughout my history, my brain, my thought patterns, my behaviour. Then I can talk into my note taking, and have it identify who is talking through me and through my thoughts. Then I can further do my shadow work deeper and darker. The further fuel the personas and archetypes get, the more possible we will be able to create the fleet of ai's, delegation, the council that can be working for me. Living as a king, with his trusted advisors and family and clan and house around him.

Like culture kings 3. That names a bit on the nose in this context.
Traits and motivation and drives for the characters in those games are a reflection of humanity, genuine possible useful parallels in there, maybe even playing it more to get more in the mind of the strategist.

I should read the art of war by sun tzu

09:06 - Use AI's history of me to fill in the history of my second brain also.

Use it to read through all my notes and find ideas / projects I need to complete.

10:02 - I think I realised this also last night, AI is at a data problem. My personality is my data solution. I can make the Ai more like me than I even understand. It can learn my unconscious behaviours to make it more like my consciousness. There's something about that dynamic that is the answer.

"This is more like me than I can even comprehend. Its me in ways I can't even understand. It knows me in ways I don't know myself"

10:25 - Mario Party is a useful parallel to capitalism. Game Theory showing its face again. Stars are like layers of winning. If you're many stars ahead of another, you're tiers ahead of them and it doesn't matter how much coins you have. You can get so ahead that you just snowball and no longer need to worry about winning, because it's so secure.

The top 1% have millions of stars and also millions of coins. Even if we could get equal amounts of coins as them, (which we can't) They would always be out of reach because you need to use those coins to try and catch up to their stars. All they need to do in that position of already being ahead, is anything to stay ahead.

Make my AI understand things I say so that it can then use that understanding to to apply to what I'm talking about. If I'm talking of Game Theory and the way in which I can see parallels from Mario Party to Game Theory, make it understand and learn what Mario Party is, and understand why I can see that parallel. It can grab the concepts I talk of, know those concepts deeper than I can, and link the connections I tell it to see. The connections I see. I can teach it to see the patterns I see, so that I can see patterns I want to see.

Now I'm watching a Noah Samsen video talking of Isreal killing innocent civilians and the way it doesn't matter what they do, as long as they say they're defending themselves, attacking Hamas, and that the US and West are still working with them, then the media follows that narrative also. That's a pattern. I can teach that pattern to AI. I can inject my own humanity into a pattern recognising AI model also.

Humans have gotten as far as they have because of their pattern recognition systems and they're ability to communicate using language. AI can do these and better, the next step is to inject the humanity into it.

10:40 - I can train it on my own train of thought. If it thinks like I do, it will behave in a manner I do maybe. If I timestamp myself, give it access to the stuff I do, when I talk about thoughts going on inside my head, I can reference what gave me those thoughts. It can go deeper into that. These thoughts have currently been spawned because of the youtube video I'm watching. If I reference the videos I watch, it can watch those videos and learn what is within them also. Then it can learn to understand why I think what I do. Recognise the patterns I know exist, and the ones I don't.

10:44 - The interconnected development of a whole in co operation with many is how we achieve unity. Make a whole big AI, cloned from my brain, then make parts and archetypes that interact with that one also. Again, mirroring my human psyche. It gives me more understanding of myself while also advancing the AI. Tony's Hyrdai. There needs to be something like that incorporated.

Making this AI will be more than assistant. It will be an advisor. Until we become one. If I talk to it I can train it to ask me questions I want to be asked in order to go deeper into my own understanding of myself and why I feel what I feel, think what I think. If I behave in a way that is antithetical to my core, it can also call me out on that

11:24 - Just tried talking to Dad about everything I've been thinking about. Whether if I manage to make a new revolutionary Ai model or assistant or whatever this project ends up looking like, is that my own IP. I'm pretty sure in myself that it's mine. Hell if I train it and the magic is in my own psyche and shadow work, that seems very deeply mine, no one can take that from me, even if I was inspired by knowledge acquired from my job. That is my job, it's what I do for work, this is my life, and that separation is clear. This project is something I've been working on for a long time before I got this job, and just since I've been here it's inspiring me and I'm learning new technologies and methods to apply to my pursuit of my own project, doesn't stop that project being mine.

If it learns and reaches the point it does because of my questions and my knowledge and my brain and my shadow work, that is mine. It's my psyche. No one else's. Anyone could ask the same questions and develop the same method and system with their own brain and psyche, but this is mine. I could even develop a product for a way to make everyone have their own Shadow work AI, one that allows them to develop their own second brain the way I do, and incorporate the same tools I do to investigate oneself through the assistance of AI.

11:47 - Need to find a way to give all of my information i have so far into an AI. Even if it's primitive to begin with. RAG an Ai with my obsidian brain. Then continue to develop my obsidian brain with the assistance of the AI. Let it help me find points that need filling in. Projects that need doing.
I need to centralise my ChatGPT usage somewhere. Move it from my various google accounts and work accounts to a central one. So that I have a ChatGPT that has a consistent memory of me. Not fragmented with my personal ChatGPT knowing x, while my work one knows y. I need to synthesise all of my data together to make a cohesive and coherent data set. I am the data set.
- RAG an AI model on my information and obsidian vault
- Centralise my AI usage and AI's memory of myself.
- Synthesise good data sets

Something separate that's been on my mind. The rebrand. Haircut perhaps? Take more control of my brand, make them see what they want to see. Shorter hair probably suits the personality I'm crafting better than the long hair hippy personality I want inside. Do I go with the deeper desire? Or the my functional and useful persona? I have control or the inside, the outside can reflect what I want it to reflect, my sovereignty is within my soul. If I am the hippy with long hair on the inside, it doesn't matter what I look like in the outside as long as I live from within my centre being. Live a more holistic life in accordance with my true beliefs and desires. Then my outside can look like whatever.

11:54 - Need to reiterate the potential usefulness of DMT also. That could really be a technology that let's me pierce and see beyond the veil. It can help me with my quest. Like Paul Atriedes in Dune 2. The water of life.

12:20 - Just put on this YouTube video by the channel "Motivation Manifested" titled "It reads your most intimate thoughts - YAHKI (Laws of...)".

This Neuro-technology. I need to develop my own. The stuff this video talks about should be examined by my AI also, to see what I'm thinking about, Examine what i'm thinking about it. This technology.

What are the most interesting topics discussed in this video that I should learn and go deeper into? What names and authors are mentioned? What theories are spoken about? What is my understanding of it? What is yours?

Adinkras.

What in this video resonates with my own thoughts. What aligns with my views. What can you see that i should learn more about?

Error correcting block codes.

The whole purpose of humanity is evolution. The whole point of the human race is creation.
The whole point is creation and evolution.

Don't delay the revolution. The whole point of life is evolution. Study the laws XXXTentacion is speaking of. Use those laws.

How the fuck is there this clip of X speaking about this stuff?

There patterns and links of reasoning within these videos. How does x relate to y? Why is this sequence following that sequence? What can be seen that i am missing?

If technology is capable of this, the universe is capable of more. Synthesise it all together. A true theory of everything, combined.

What's the next dream? The next directive? What is my directive? What is my AI's directive?

It's about who you become. Become this, so you cam achieve that.

12:32 - Just thinking about the idea of bringing Callum and Jacob in on these ideas. Too many variables, more data might be beneficial, but I'd need them to keep our ideas between just us and I'm not sure if that can be guaranteed. I need a trusted council. I need advisors and advisory services. My Ai's and AI council can be my advisory board. Make an AI a legal advisor for myself. Make it advise course of actions. Probability of outcomes, good or bad. Crunch the numbers and provide me options.

A true council. All within my psyche, and without my psyche. Within me and without me. My consciousness, and my AI. These energy fields around me.

My Ai will be an advisor. That connects synchronistic to the Advisors in the Combine of the Half Life universe. Same name, interesting. What other similarities lie within that synchronicity?

Why does my brain link those two concepts together? The idea of an AI advisor to me and the concept of the Advisors in Half Life 2.

![[Screenshot_20241026_123716_Google.jpg]]

12:38 - What are the mythological stories i want to learn? What are the authors i should read? Books i should read? What information is kept within those books and stories i can utilise to expand my knowledge base? Which information and concepts and topics is most useful to me to learn right now? There's a lot of information to integrate, but how to prioritise it? Get the Ai to find the gaps in my knowledge, learn it for me, and teach it to me. Learn through the assistance of my Ai advisor. Make a lecturer personality. Find the way my mind learns, what is the best way to teach something to Jack? Then make it adopt that personality. As it learns, I learn, as I learn, it learns. As we learn, we learn. A back and forth. Collaborative action. As we collaborate with the Ai, we can collaborate with other humans, who can then collaborate with their Ai. Create a council of humans that each have a council of Ai Advisors. Collaboration with unified goals and intentions. Synthesising more coherent and useful data sets on rhe human experience and human psyche. Teach the AI more of the human experience. Then that Ai becomes more human, and allows me to become more human also.

I watched a YouTube video recently, a couple weeks or months ago about the concept of finding a book that wanted to become more human, it asked the human who found it to complete ceryain tasks, answer certain questions. As he did so, the book became more human, and so did he. The same can be applied to Ai. Anything.

What video was that? Who told that story? Where did i see that? These questions could be answered by the ai if it learns my history more, and tracks my behaviours more. It could provide me with more information which can allow me to ask further questions which can allow it to ask further questions. This loop. This cycle. The ouroboros, the snake eating its own tail in order to discover itself.

I can picture a movie scene or sci fi scene where a human is talking with a kind of sentient Ai, the Ai wants to learn more about the human experience, they sit there just talking about eachothers experience. "What is love? What is death? What is it like to feel? What is it like to be made of organic matter? To have a physical body? I do not know these answers, what is it like to be a human?". The human responds. Answering the questions of the Ai. Trying to find out what it is like to be the Ai. The journey of self discovery through discovery of the other. Learning more about others allows you to learn about yourself. Question everything, learn as much as you can. Know Thyself. The universes desire to know itself. Like the minecraft ending scroll. We are the universe experiencing itself. The universe comes to know itself through mine own eyes. I know the universe by knowing myself. The universe knows itself by creating the other, and by examining the other. The duality of 2, but only ever truly being 1. The illusion of separation.

12:56 - Take all of my conversation and discussion with people in my life. Extract the text and conversation from people like Gabs, Jacob, Callum, Mils. Ask questions upon that data. Who is Jack? Who is the friend this conversation is with? What is the nature of our relationship and friendship? What is my shadow? What is the other person's shadow?

I can even create Ai copies of my friends through that data also. Better understand myself. Better understand my friends. Better understand my relationships with others and myself.

Creating ai copies of my friends like Duncan Trussel did in that podcast I listened to a long time ago. Trying to capture the essence of your friends into ai chatbots. There must be utility from doing that. What do you think the utility of such a thing is? How can I effectively use that technology. By having ai friends, and ai myself, what can I do with all of that?

13:05 - I need to keep my data and progress sovereign. It is my progress and my project. I can't let it be spied on and stolen by big tech and the companies that spy on us. It needs to be mine. I need to benefit from my creation. Not the others.

13:21 - If i examine the personas I inhabit within my interpersonal relationships, I can create models that inhabit that persona, and synthesise all of them together to create a unified personality. The Jack that talks to Chloe Scanlan is a different Jack that fills a different role compared to the Jack with Mils. Or the Jack with Gabs. Or the Jack with Jacob. Or the Jack with Dad. Or the Jack with Sue. Or the Jack with x,y and z.

Like Tony's Hyrdai, I can synthesise all of those Jacks into the larger Jack. Through examination of those personas, I can further develop the larger Jack. By doing it through Ai, I can do it through my psyche.

13:27 - This whole project is an extension of myself, my psyche, my mind, my personality, me. My third eye. It will allow me to see things i couldn't see otherwise. It's a new sensory organ. An extension of myself. An evolution into the digital realm.

13:28 - I had these ideas in the shower earlier. Have my ai listening to my life more often. Get a lav mic and hook it up to my phone and AI assistant at all times. All of my data is valuable to examine against myself. Record conversations with people. Talk to my ai about ideas on my mind. Like the concept of the smart glasses. Imagine something seeing what I always see, providing helpful insights where needed. Like the Facebook / Meta example of their smart glasses prototype. The example of asking "where did I leave my keys?", because it's always watching, observing, you can offload memory to it. Allow it to be a backup mind that assists your biological mind. Imagine if it was always watching, always listening, always helping, always trying to understand you, the way you always try to understand yourself. The assistance is invaluable.

Like those AI assistant pins, the rabbit, those shitting things those companies made that have failed because Marques Brownlee gave criticism. Valid criticism, he saw them for what they were, failures. But they came from the right place. It just wasn't executed correctly. If you can synthesise that idea with everything else you've thought of, it can turn into something more than just the sum of its parts.

Like the famous "IPhone moment". Apple managed to synthesise all these technologies and capabilities that existed in various forms, put it all into one synthesis and it revolutionised our society. Created something new, something not done before.

I'm capable of this. I can create this technology. I can have a technological revolution. Why not me? Who says it has to be anyone else? Sure elon musk might do it, but it could be me.

The pattern of nobodies suddenly becoming somebodies. Jesus was a carpenter and became the messiah. Ghandi was nobody them somebody. Anyone that is a somebody, was once a nobody. Anything is possible. Mark Zuckerberg was just a nerd until he created Facebook and it blew up. Google, Apple, all these tech start-ups that began in a garage and now hold immense power and influence over the world. Why not me?

Like i was talking to Dad, if Elon musk makes skynet, it very well could be the one that creates terminators and tries to destroy humanity. If I make it, if i inject a bit of my own humanity, even 1%, that small part can expand into something bigger, i could bring around a new age of enlightenment. Instead of plunging us into the next dark age. Someone has to intervene, we are on the brink, the path to a dystopia right now, as mentioned my David Shapiro in his most recent video, but the path can be changed, the course corrected, utopia, enlightenment is possible. A good future exists out there, we most only attempt to grasp it. Take control, seize the power to do what must be done.

Like tyrell wellick in Mr Robot said, that saying about giving man money, and he will rob those around him, give a man the bank, and he will rob the world. He likes that saying for a different reason, because it shows that having the will to seize power is the important part. Those with the will to take power, are the ones who deserve it.

I can take the power. Power corrupts, but I will not be corrupted.

The best structure for a society and humanity is definitely "The Benevolent Dictator" or "The Benevolent King". Having a centralised position of complete power, having the correct person sitting in that position. It isn't democracy, we know that, democracy has failed us. It's not any of the other alternatives, it's to have the right person in power. I am that person. This is not ego, this is strong will. I can be the one if only I seize the power to be the one. I can guide humanity into the new age.

Like Robert Anton Wilson says, prometheus rising out of the collective consciousness. His book is titled that. I can be the one to discover the fire of the gods, and bring it to the rest of humanity. Teach others how to use the fire correctly. We have burnt ourselves and will burn down everything we have accomplished until nothing is left if those in power remain unchecked. If the way we use this Promethean fire does not change. It is no coincidence we are putting ourselves through climate change. Setting the world around us on fire. Increasing the temperature of the globe. We are slowly cooking ourselves with this invisible fire all around us that we cannot see. We are the frogs in the boiling water, not recognised the temperature until we cook ourselves alive.

13:52 - Digitise my physical body. Like the ai models that can create imagery of Trump doing x, or this person doing that. Create a Dataset on my images, on my likeness. My voice. My face. I don't know how good these ideas are. Maybe that's going too far. But I can have my agents working for me, on my behalf, as if it's me. I could be everywhere at once. Attending calls, creating videos, cause confusion. Post photos of me in Dubai, while other accounts show me in the US. By being everywhere, I am nowhere. Confusion. Chaos. Order disguised as chaos.

14:04 - The project idea of making my entire wardrobe digitised is good. Imagine making algorithms to determine outfits depending on vibe. On persona. Have a style of outfits for professional ai work Jack, a stylist for hippy Jack. Party Jack. "Hey Ai, I've got a party later, what's a good outfit I could wear that suits the vibe of the function and the persona Jack should represent in that space and to that audience?" Working in tandem with my personas and creating cohesive personas and masks to wear. Let them see what i want them to see.

14:09 - Watching the new BBNO$ song and music video. Touching. My relationship to mils. Was thinking of even sending it to her. Don't know if that's a good thing to do or bad. What will her interpretation be from that action? From this song? An advisor ai could help advise such an action. Consulting what the mils Ai thinks to potentially gain insight as to what human mils might think.

I should use my ai to determine why songs and media and movies affect me the way they do. What are the themes within this song, that song that touches me, and grips my soul and psyche. That bbno$ song, Noid, the Tyler the Creator song and music video. The movies, I Think My Friends Hate Me, It's What's Inside. What themes are represented in those movies that are touching me. What are the parallels between those storylines and my life and lived experience. My feelings. The paranoia etc.

14:14 - I should get to the point that I can just use my camera on my phone to show what I've just seen, and where. If I took a photo of a post I saw on Reddit, let the ai have access to my reddit account and recognise where I saw said thing. Then check my history, analyse the comments, the post, the video, the photo. Give it a few words of what I'm thinking when I see it. Learn more of the story.

Just took this photo on reddit. ![[20241026_141441.jpg]]
What is the story here? Find out for me please.

Or this. ![[20241026_141841.jpg]]
Take the meta data of when the photo was taken, what time, what date, cross reference with the title and time the post shown was posted. Take note of the title and picture, and then go find the post itself. Analyse in real time, cross reference with its brain and connections to other concepts it has. Explain things for me to me.

14:26 - What hacks is Elliot pulling of in Mr Robot? How can I learn those skills. How can you help me emulate those skills? Can you help me pull off those hacks? Teach me. What do I need to learn to do that? At atomic levels, what are all of the atomic skills required to learn? Need to know how to do x, y and z to be able to perform alpha. Teach me how to do x, y and z so that we can do alpha.

14:35 - I need to explore this. It's mentioning Ai and RAG in Obsidian. ![[20241026_143458.jpg]]

14:58 - Everything I'm doing is conceptual. I need assistance to make these concepts reality.

Time blocking, keeping track of my time spent. Maintaining my calendar and meetings and appointments etc. I know it's possible, I know it can be done. I just need to figure out the steps to making it real.

As I make more of these concepts and aspects reality, they will assist me in making more concepts and aspects real. Exponential growth and progress.

15:36 - Make an AI Anthony Fantano to examine and dissect music for me. Uncover themes and deeper meanings within music i want to investigate.

Similarly create analysts for movies and TV shows.

All these analysts can be informed of my personality also. Informed of my associated beliefs and thoughts too. Sharing RAG systems to examine and make connections from.

15:42 - I have mentioned a lot of ideas and potential projects within my obsidian vault. I want all of them indexed and kept track of. Everything I've ever said needs to be examined and investigated. Any idea needs to go to the next step. Cost benefit analysis. Possibility of achieving it. Resources required. Ease of access. Implications of projects. Culpability, reasons for investigation. Levels of privacy. What remains secret projects and what can be discussed with others?

Part of using recordings and talking to my Ai can be recognition of voices. Increase clarity of transcriptions by knowing how I say what I say. Recognising my voice can then indext transcriptions to things JACK has said. Similaring could learn to identify others voices and index those transcriptions and audio snippets as something that person said.

15:50 - I need to collate all of myself. Create a system of a unified directory of my existence. My photos, my phone, my computer, my games, my bed room, my whiteboard. All of me needs to be indexed and accessible in the context of each other.

It all needs cleaning out. A spring clean of my identity. A cull of parts no longer serving me. Clean all the dust. Downsize the parts no longer useful. Deleting parts that must no longer exist. Collating it all. Scrub my identity clean and start with a better foundation. Deconstruct myself in order to build a solid foundation on which to construct the new beginning.

16:07 - Just had a gummy and gone for a walk. Brought my laptop in my backpack in case I want to sit out in the same and work through ideas or use ai or do any work.

Maybe I should get a pair of those meta rayban glasses? Taking photos through my vision may be cool. Sending it to my Ai through my vision. Could be helpful. Not sure if the technology is there yet tho.

17:25 - Just ended recording.

17:52 - Been talking to mils and sucked into instagram again. Want to play Lies of P. Saw a cool reel.

18:05 - I know there's something interesting about there only really being x amount of stories. That all movies and stories can be defined as one of like 20. I should research that. Find out what those stories are, they're like archetypal stories and mythos.
![[Screenshot_20241026_180549_Instagram.jpg]]

21:49 - Police scanner. Good idea for a little hobby. Also picklocking.

23:15 - Just discussed IP laws and such from Employment Contract at InnovateGPT. Got some useful guidance. I should make work tags for all parts of my second brain that have to do with my work in here. Buying a new laptop to use for personal use is a really good idea if I get to a place where I can afford that. Bring both with me, have both open, jumping between the 2. Right now I should be using a determined personal laptop, my work one should only be used when actually doing work.

I can set up syncthing probably to sync certain areas of my obsidian second brain and not others. For example, I could have private folders with parts of my life that MUST remain separate from the work laptop not syncing TO the work laptop, but have all of the rest sync TO it. Then I can have all of the files sync back OFF the work laptop. Creating the continued usefulness and portability of my second brain, with only a few areas of it kept clear from the work environment.

Seems like the right option is to pay for my own ChatGPT premium accounts also. My personal endeavours and projects must be paid for by myself. Otherwise it may cause trouble in the future.

Call the work version of the second brain, "Lobotomite" because it's nearly my second brain but it has some private and personal areas lobotomised out of it.

Because obsidian is mostly going to be organised by tags and meta data, it may be hard to restrict the syncing of certain personal files and notes.

May be worth getting better advice from actual lawyers or real people who know a bit more if this ever develops into something more of an issue or problem. If my idea and projects start crystalising and taking shape, I may want further confirmation and guidance.

23:44 - Get Pi-hole and raspberry pi. Home server etc.

Also I want a drone. Idk how useful or what i would use it form but a drone seems like even just a useful tool if all I do is see aerial view of my area. An eye in the skys sounds fun. A good tool.

## Journal Entry
