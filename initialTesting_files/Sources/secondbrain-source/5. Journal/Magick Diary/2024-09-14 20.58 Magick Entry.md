# Emotions
Really good. I spent most of the day being productive on Obsidian and listening to music. Do feeling good, despite the dreams

# Physical Condition
Fine

# Name of Rituals Performed
[[RR]] and [[TCR]]

# Performance
Fine. I feel about out of the magick at the moment, I missed the last two days and spent all of today working on Obsidian. I feel like once my vault is done I can really settle into the Magickal process and consistency. Drew [[11. Justice]].

# Results
I drew Justice again, now the second time. I've already examined the card before so I'm gonna keep it brief. I just feel again that it's something about balancing my life out. I'll keep doing what I'm doing and hopefully I'll reach a point where I'm living my life as much as thinking about it.
