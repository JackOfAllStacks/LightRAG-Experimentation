# Emotions
Excited for the future, looking forward to continue my studies. Feel like there's much to learn, but that excites me.

# Physical Condition
Awake and alert, feeling fine. Meditated earlier to clear mind, still got a bit of that despite watching some YouTube and listening to music.

# Name of Rituals Performed
Relaxation Ritual

# Performance
For a first time attempt, I would consider it successful. I visualised the golden ball well, not enough to truly see it, but knowing it's there and that if my visualisation skills were better I would see it, was definitely felt and felt true.

# Results
Couldn't really see the orb, but felt it and it's effects of relaxation well enough, brought myself to a calm centre of consciousness.
