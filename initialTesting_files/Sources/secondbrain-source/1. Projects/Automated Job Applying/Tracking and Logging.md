# Tracking and Logging
I should have some way to log the specific jobs I have applied to using this method. Integrating this into my Obsidian system would be ideal. Make notes for each job to keep track of them, and automate this whole process even further.
- Create a note that lists all applied jobs
- Create notes for each job
- Automatically fill out each jobs note with relevant information
	- Skills needed
	- Industry
	- A bit about the job listing
	- A bit about the company it's for
	- Link to the job listing directly through this note.
