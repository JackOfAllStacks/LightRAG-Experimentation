# Avoiding Detection
I obviously need to not be noticed that I am using automation and bots to do my bidding. I need to not flag myself as a bot and set up ways to hide the fact.
**Some ways to do so**
- Add delays and randomize your interactions (clicks, typing) to mimic human behaviour.
- Rotate IP addresses if youâ€™re sending too many requests (using services like proxies or VPNs).
