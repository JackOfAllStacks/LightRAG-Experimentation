# Automating search

## Web Scraping Tools
You can use Python with libraries like `BeautifulSoup` or `Selenium` to scrape job listings from Indeed or Seek based on your search criteria. This can grab new job postings and compile them into a list.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Ideal for scraping static web pages.
- **Selenium**: Allows interaction with dynamic content, such as clicking through pages or filling out forms.

## Apis
Some platforms, like LinkedIn, have APIs for job search. You could build a script using LinkedInâ€™s API to pull job data automatically.
