# Job Criteria
A couple of categories to narrow down.

## Job Keywords
Decide on keywords or job titles that match your ideal role (e.g., "entry-level tech," "marketing assistant," etc.).
- Entry level Tech
- Data Entry

## Location & Filters
Specify filters like location, salary range, and job type (full-time, part-time, etc.).
- Mornington Peninsula
- Maybe Melbourne and further away towards the city
- Ideally some kind of hybrid work if I can get some kind of office job
- Remote work
- Full time / Part time
- Salary Range is unknown. About 800-1000 a week would be good. Less if I get desperate, any more is really good

## Platforms
Since you’re using platforms like **Indeed**, **Seek**, and **LinkedIn**, decide which platform you’d like to start automating first.
- Seek
- LinkedIn
	- Probably start with LinkedIn as it's the most official and professional. If I base the system off LinkedIn the others should fall into place easy enough.
- Indeed
