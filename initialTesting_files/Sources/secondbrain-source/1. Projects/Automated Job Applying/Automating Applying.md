# Automating Applying
## Resume & Cover Letter Customization
Use templates for your resume and cover letter. You can automate the customization using Python’s `Jinja2` template engine. It would pull specific job details into the templates.

## Email Automation
For jobs that require email applications, you can use Python’s `smtplib` to automatically send an email with your resume and cover letter attached.

## Linkedin Automation
You can automate LinkedIn job applications with a Selenium script. This would log in to your account, navigate to job pages, and automatically apply using your stored resume and details.
