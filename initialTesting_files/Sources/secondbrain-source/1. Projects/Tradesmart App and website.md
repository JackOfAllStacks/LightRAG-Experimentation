# Tradesmart App and Website
[[Joe Di Iorio]] doesn't seem to understand my idea for this project. My best bet is to create it first, and show it to him. I need to show merit for my ideas. Work independently until we have something solid and convincing to show.
I believe there is a problem here that I can solve really well, and create a win win situation. If I can show [[Tradesmart]] that this is a good idea, then I could easily produce this product.

## Target Demographics
- customers who read the physical catalogues
-

## Ideas
- a place for people to get their most recent catalogues
- explore members and suppliers
- member locator
- order tab

## Member Portal
Mentioned by [[Joe Di Iorio]]

## Competitors
- Bunnings (Their app looks like a pretty good one to copy and innovate from)
- Total Tools
- Sydney Tools (?)
Check competitors websites and apps.

## Market Research
Check competitors websites and apps.
Need to see if an app is usable in this industry because [[Joe Di Iorio]] does not think so. If he's right, we must not waste too much time.

## What's in it for Me?
I think I could take advantage of an opening I can see. A gap I can fill. If I can prove so, I can potentially get work out of it, and then from there, evidence and merit of making a name for myself
Add such a project to a portfolio of my own.
Potential further work with [[CPS]], [[Paint Place]], or [[Tradesmart]] members. Potential competitors in the industry, shop around with the idea and see if there's ANY takers.
