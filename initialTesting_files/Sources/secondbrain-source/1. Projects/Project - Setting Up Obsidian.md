# Setting up Obsidian
I'm trying to set up my vault for [[Obsidian]] in a particular way that I NEED it to be before my brain will allow me to start using it effectively. Yes I could possibly convince my brain just to start and then build it the way I see fit as I go, but [[Jack Di Iorio|Jack]]'s brain doesn't work like that, and it's not the time to try and make it work that way now. I need to start with an effective and efficient base, and then by all means I will allow myself to iterate upon my methodology as I see fit. However, I already have a very concrete way of how I want this process to work in my head, I just need to externalise it a bit in order to break down the steps that are needed to accomplish it.
