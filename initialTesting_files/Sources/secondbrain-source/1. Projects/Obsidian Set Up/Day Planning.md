# Day Planning

## Initial Thoughts from First Draft
In conjunction with habit tracking and making my routines, I want these to be reflected in the day planner and the calendar section of obsidian in a way that I can use Obsidian to organise my life. I have already found out that [[Day Planner Plugin]] can only pull events from google calendar into obsidian and not send tasks from obsidian out to google calendar, however, on more thought this probably works in my advantage, as I can use google calendar for all formal events such as going to the movies, appointments, meetings etc, and keep my obsidian task for more personal events and tasks, such as; taking the bins out on certain days, my gym routine and my habits. I have also made an account with [[Todoist]] as I came across the plugin that can send obsidian tasks to [[Todoist]], but again there is a limitation here where it cannot receive tasks from [[Todoist]] to obsidian. But it seems it may be able to send tasks from [[Todoist]] to google calendar? Just going to need more tinkering with and determining what system works best. As stated before, it might just work better having google calendar and my obsidian calendar separate, it will allow me to move my personal plans in obsidian around my formal plans in google calendar. Eg. My obsidian planner is set so that I wake up and go to gym at 6:15, then have breakfast at 7:30, start work at 9, have lunch at 12 etc, but then that day I have a meeting with someone set for 12 in google calendar as that's where my formal commitments go, I can then go into my obsidian and it will have pulled my meeting from google calendar into it, and I can then move my lunchtime task around the meeting.
