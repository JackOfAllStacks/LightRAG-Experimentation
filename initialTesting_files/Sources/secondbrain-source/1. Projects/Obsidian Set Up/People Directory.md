# People Directory
I've seen some examples of people keeping track of certain people in their life in Obsidian. Writing events in their daily notes where they say "meeting with John" and john will link to a note of that person where it can hold certain bits of data relevant to that person such as relation and job. This will allow me to keep track of the people I meet in my life and the days and events in which I see them. Whenever I have a meeting with a person and write their name down in the meeting, so too I will be able to see all meetings I've had with that person from their note.
