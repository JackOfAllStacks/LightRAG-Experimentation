# Book Resources
I want an area dedicated to my books. This will essentially be a digital recreation of a library.
Things this area should do;
- Have an entry for every book I own
- Have an area to keep track of books I want to own
- Differentiate my books that I have read, and need to read. Maybe make a reading list and order which books are to be read after my current one. Finish this book and then I move onto book number 1 in my reading list?
- Books should link to any notes taken from topics within the book. Eg. [[Prometheus Rising]] linking to [[Eight-Circuit Model of Consciousness]]

## Book Note Taking
A big reason I want to set this up is so that I can take effective notes of important topics from the books I read. Whether it's about psychology, physics or magick, I want to use Obsidian to take notes of the books I'm reading while I'm reading them, so that the knowledge gained doesn't just go in one ear and out the other. There has already been multiple instances since I've read [[Prometheus Rising]] and [[Cosmic Trigger I]] where I've wanted to recount specific quotes or tidbits of knowledge, only to try and go back through the book and successfully or unsuccessfully find what I was looking for. If I set up Obsidian, I want to be able to take notes as I'm reading, about quotes, my thoughts on specific passages, page numbers and topics. I want to have a specific template set for my book note taking with specific bits of metadeta included so that I can call upon dataview queries for use cases such as the one in the dataview github page. Some bits of metadeta needed would be;
- Book name
- Date started
- Date finished
- My score rating of it
- Pages
- Topic/s
- Fiction or non fiction
- Genre
- date published
- ISBN (The barcode identifier)
- Author

## Books to Read
I want to use obsidian as somewhere I can write down my wishlist for books I come across that I'd be interested in reading. A way I could do this would be to have a note titled something like "Books to read" or "Book Wishlist" or "To Read", something like that, and then within the note I would open it open, and write down the book within square brackets to automatically link to a note for the book. Then I could possibly travel to that note, have it call upon a template that fills in the note with the template for my book note taking, and fill in areas of the author and genre so that I can find the book later. Something I've done too often is write down the name of a book I hear about, not put down the author, or where I heard it or what interested me in that moment to want to read it, I could find a way to do this. Write in the note where I heard of the book and what prompted me to be interested in it. **Potentially add this feature to book note taking template**
