# Going back through Notes
This should be one of the final steps taken during this project. As I build more and more and organise my vault more and more, I will need to go back through just about every note I've created so far and make sure they adhere to all new systems of the vault.
- Adding correct [[PARA Method - Area]] links to [[PARA Method - Resource]] notes
- Adding relevant [[Tags]] to all created notes
- Moving all notes to correct location within the [[Organisational System of the Vault]] eg. Putting notes in the [[Zettelkasten Directory]] [[PARA Method - Resource]] folder or finding it's nested location within folders in [[Project Directory|1. Projects]]
