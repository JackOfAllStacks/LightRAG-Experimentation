# 0. Maps of Content
**Maps Of Content** is yet to be fully defined and explored on it's usage. As of the present moment it holds 2 notes; [[My Projects]] and [[My Areas]], because these are indexes to help navigate my vault and do not fit in any other defined location. I believe this is a good spot for them to belong, and am sure I will know when other notes are to be moved here too. I think as indexes in [[Area Directory|2. Areas]] get bigger, they will warrant being moved into **0. Maps Of Content** at some point.
I just realised that making a **Map Of Content** note and using a [[dataview]] query to show all notes with a certain tag would be a great way to organically make an emergent **Map Of Content**. In which case, perhaps I do give it a template to use, or assign it the same or a similar template as the [[Area Directory]].

## Templates for Maps of Content
**The MOC Directory** does not require a template because the notes that are going to be within this directory are not necessarily going to be created in this directory. As established above, most likely the notes that end up here, will most likely evolve from a note originally from [[Area Directory|2. Areas]].
