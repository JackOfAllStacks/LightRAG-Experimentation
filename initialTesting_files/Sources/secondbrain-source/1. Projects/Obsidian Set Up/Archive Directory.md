# 6. Archives
This is the [[PARA Method - Archive]] element of the [[PARA Method]].

This has a straight forward purpose. That is, to be where all notes go to after they have lost their relevance to the current moment.
Examples;
- Past Projects
- Past Areas
- Past Fleeting notes that have since been made into full notes
I'm unsure as of yet as to whether or not any resources will be sent to the **archives**. Right now I can only imagine that resources will stay in resources, because who knows when a [[PARA Method - Resource|Resource (PARA)]] will be needed or relevant again. Compared to [[PARA Method - Project|Projects (PARA)]] and [[PARA Method - Area|Areas (PARA)]] which are usually created for a reason. Once a [[PARA Method - Project|Project (PARA)]] is completed, it and relevant notes are most likely not to be relevant again and thus sent to the [[PARA Method - Archive|Archive (PARA)]]. Same with past [[PARA Method - Area|Areas (PARA)]].
