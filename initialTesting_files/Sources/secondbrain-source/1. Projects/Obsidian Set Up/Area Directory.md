# 2. Areas
This is the [[PARA Method - Area|Area (PARA)]] directory, following the structure of the [[PARA Method]].
This is where we list all current Areas as notes, for other notes to link to. As [[PARA Method - Area|areas]] get bigger, they can be transferred to [[MOC Directory|0. Maps Of Content]]. But until then, [[Area Directory|2. Areas]] will list all currently used [[PARA Method - Area|Areas (PARA)]] in the form of notes. I anticipate that [[PARA Method - Area|Areas]] may too be moved into [[Archive Directory|6. Archives]] once they are not an [[PARA Method - Area|Area (PARA)]]that is actively relevant to my life.

## [[Templating]] For Areas
As part of [[Templating]] I am making the [[2. Area Template]].

### Elements of the [[2. Area Template]]
- YAML Frontmatter
	- Date and Time of note creation
	- Last edited date
	- [[Tags]] ([[PARA Method - Area]], and more personal [[tags]] relevant to this [[PARA Method - Area|Area (PARA)]] that [[PARA Method - Resource|Resources (PARA)]] and [[PARA Method - Project|Projects (PARA)]] will also use)
	- Aliases
	- Links (Linked to [[My Areas]])
	- Projects (as a listed format so that it will list all [[PARA Method - Project]]s relevant to this [[PARA Method - Area]])
- Title
- A [[Dataview Plugin|dataview]] query to list all [[PARA Method - Resource|Resources (PARA)]] belonging to this [[PARA Method - Area|Area (PARA)]]

## Areas I want to Focus on
These are some areas that are important and need special focus:
- [[Book Directory]]
- [[People Directory]]
- [[Accounts Directory]]
- [[Recipes Directory]]
- [[Places Directory]]
- [[Clothes Directory]]
- [[Services Directory]]
- [[Health Directory]]
