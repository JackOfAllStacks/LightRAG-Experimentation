# 99. Meta
This is a folder for META aspects of the [[Obsidian]] vault.
Such as;
- Templates
- Scripts
- CSS Elements
- Code relevant to the vault

## [[Templating]] For 99. Meta
The Meta folder has had a template created for it [[99. Meta Template]]. This is an empty template with literally nothing in it. This was needed because I set a [[Root Template]] for the [[Root Directory]]of the entire vault. Because of this, notes that were intended to be technical such as templates were starting with properties taken from the [[Root Template]].
This was fixed simply by creating and setting the blank [[99. Meta Template]].

## Sub-directories of 99. Meta
- [[Journal Template Directory]]
- [[Resource Template Directory]]
