# Daily Notes
To make my daily notes the way I want, there are a few areas I need to cover.
- [[Routine Making]]
- [[Habit Tracking]]
- [[Day Planning]]

## Other Daily Notes
There are a few kinds of notes I wish to be made daily. It would be optimal for there to be some kind of automation to create these considering consistent use.
- Magick Diary entries. These should be done at least daily, potentially getting to a point where it's multiple times a day
- Dream Journal Entries
- Daily Journal

### Ideas
I had some ideas to add to the daily notes.
- have an automated dataview query to show the notes that were created on that day.
- create a note style that is quotes. find a way for daily notes to pull open quote notes and present me with a random quote every day.
- I want to find a way to automatically encapsulate my notes into folders at the end of a month so that my journal entries stay easy to navigate. On the last day of a month, create a folder for that month and put all of the daily notes from that month within. Then each quarter, create a folder that puts all the months into it. So on and so forth for each up until years. There will need to be a way to integrate each additional type of note eg. Weekly Note, Monthly Note, Quarterly Note, Yearly Note.
