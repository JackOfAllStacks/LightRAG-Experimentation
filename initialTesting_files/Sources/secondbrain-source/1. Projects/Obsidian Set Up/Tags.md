# Tags

## Initial Thoughts from First Draft
The video I'm using for some inspiration uses tags with the # for the status of his notes, indicating the level of maturity of the note. And uses a tag section on the note to link to other notes with the names of said tags. I'm still unsure as to which method I will use, or maybe a mixture of the two, we will have to see. This guy also has a tags folder, where he moves all his notes to that become used as tags.
Some ideas for tags(Status as according to this video) to use are;
- Baby, child and adult for indicating the maturity of the note
- Quote if the note contains a note
Tips for tagging.
1. Avoid getting too vague
2. Avoid being too specific
	- Ask yourself if it's likely for you to use this tag again for another note
3. Personalise your tags. Make tags that relate to you and serve you. Use interests of your own to create tags around. Some kinds you would come cross in the wider world could be; Fitness, Mental Health, Sport etc. But use tags more relevant to yourself.
4. Avoid using too many. 4-5 is a good number, but less is also fine. Don't be scared if it's a 1 tag note
