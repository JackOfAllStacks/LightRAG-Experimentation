# Goal Making
This is a very important part of my Obsidian Project. A strong element to be implemented along side [[Daily Note Outlining]] and the like.

Something that I REALLY need to do more of is setting goals and keeping myself accountable to said goals. If I just keep floating through life I won't achieve anything unless I set myself goals to achieve and continuously try to achieve them and check in to so how I am doing with said goals. I know about [[SMART goals]] and setting them to be time focused and what not. I'm just living my life in such a decentralized and disorganized way that I can't even bring myself to make goals let alone strive for them or track how I'm doing towards them. These goals can be incorporated into weekly notes and such, checking in with myself and seeing how the goals are going throughout the week and week to week.
