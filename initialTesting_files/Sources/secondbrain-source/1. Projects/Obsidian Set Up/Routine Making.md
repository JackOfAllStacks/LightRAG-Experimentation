# Routine Making

## Initial Thoughts from First Draft
This goes hand in hand with my habit tracking. But I want to make routines for my life as well as just the habits. Think about it like a routine is a collection of habits I want to do. Already I have in my mind a daily routine I'd like to enforce, and a gym routine. The daily routine entails stuff like;
- A morning routine
	- waking up at a certain time
	- then brushing my teeth
	- having breakfast etc.
- A bedtime routine
	- no technology after a certain time
	- bed by a certain bedtime
	- reading before bed etc.
- A daytime routine
	- Work
	- Meals like lunch and dinner
	- Gym
	- Meditation
	- Learning a Language
	- Reading
	- Cooking
My Gym routine has certain exercises depending on the day such as Monday being chest and triceps, Tuesday being back and shoulders day etc. So I want my days to be calling upon my gym routine and telling me which gym day it is.
Some other routines I would like would be something like weekly or bi weekly or monthly events. Some examples;
- Take out the bins every Thursday night\
- Every Sunday look at what goals I set for that week and write down my thoughts on if I accomplished what I wanted to accomplish or not. And also write more goals for the week
- Every month look at how I stuck to my habits and routines, did I do a good job? What could be improved? Same with goals. Did I set goals to achieve that month and how did I go? What were some notable things that happened that month etc.
