# Organisational System of the Vault
**The organisational system of my vault** is going to be a homebrew creation of my own that meets my own desires and needs. We are going to start with a mixture between the [[PARA Method]] and the [[Zettelkasten Method]]. This will be achieved by having a [[Project Directory]], an [[Area Directory]], a [[Resource Directory]], and an [[Archive Directory]] as outlined by the [[PARA Method]].

To integrate the [[Zettelkasten Method]], we will have a [[Zettelkasten Directory]] within the [[Resource Directory]], and a [[Fleeting Directory]] too for brain dumping quick notes to be expanded upon later. I will also be creating **literature notes** as in the [[Zettelkasten Method]], however I don't think they should have their own directory, and should instead be incorporated through the use of [[tags]]. That is still something to be decided however, maybe a **literature notes directory** is beneficial, we will see as we progress.

As well as borrowing inspiration from the [[PARA Method]] and the [[Zettelkasten Method]] for organisation, I have too been inspired by other vaults on YouTube and have sprinkled in some ideas of my own. They are the [[MOC Directory]], [[Journal Directory]], and [[Meta Directory]].

# Updates
This is now the second time I've gotten myself stuck with this organisation, and I think I'm overcomplicating things. **Fleeting Notes** do not need their own directory and can instead just be signified as by a tag within the Zettelkasten directory. In fact, so too can **Literature Notes**, and actually all notes that I've been trying to organise by creating folders and directories in order to automate [[templating]] and such. I'm making it too hard, which is what the [[PARA Method]] was meant to avoid. Same with all the different areas of my life I'm trying to account for at this point, which is way too early. The [[Zettelkasten Method]] was explained to allow areas of notes to grow organically, and I'm trying to step in before it's growing, and predict which areas will exist, and what properties they will have an require, in order to create a template for the directory to use.
I need to just step back and let it happen organically. It makes more sense compared to trying to predict what properties the areas will need, and instead create the notes with the properties they need and then form the area around that.

**Enough with using folders**. [[Obsidian]] is designed to allow for organisation by better means. Folders is too primitive and confusing. [[Journaling]] is the one exception that I think does benefit from the current way I'm going about it.

## Structure
This [[Vault Structured Mind Map.canvas|Vault Structured Mind Map]] is a canvas file I am using for visual representation to help organise and create this structure.
I've settled on a structure that is as follows:
- [[MOC Directory|0. Maps Of Content]]
- [[Project Directory|1. Projects]]
- [[Area Directory|2. Areas]]
- [[Resource Directory|3. Resources]]
- [[Fleeting Directory|4. Fleeting Notes]]
- [[Journal Directory|5. Journal]]
- [[Archive Directory|6. Archives]]
- [[Meta Directory|99. Meta]]

# Initial Thoughts from First Draft
**This paragraph is outdated and from the first time I started working on this and outlining what this vault and project entailed. It is being kept here despite losing its relevance to the project at this point.**
I am learning about the [[PARA Method]] of note taking and also the [[Zettelkasten Method]] of taking notes. From what I have seen so far, I like both for different reasons and think I might be able to do a bit of a mixture of the two. Hopefully a best of both worlds. But also I feel no need to tie myself down too hard to any one methodology, as whatever works for me, will probably be some kind of highly individualised method that I grok together. So I'm just going to be a bit fast and loose with this methodology really, whatever way I find works well for me is the way I'm going to do it.
