# Habit Tracking

## Initial Thoughts from First Draft
Another big reason I want to use obsidian is for the daily notes, and to find a way to use obsidian in a way that mimics various other programs I've come across such as motionapp. I believe there is a way to use obsidian in this way, but I no doubt believe it will be complicated and hard, and in my current endeavours have already encountered such difficulties. Some ways I would like to use habit tracking are;
- Have some feature in my weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly notes that can visualise the success of commitment to habits
- Have to do checkboxes or something of the sort on my daily notes so that I can open obsidian, see my daily note and see what habits I need to do and at what times. Finding a way to simply tick things off as I go will make it easier for me to stick to the habits
- Keep track of other habits that aren't necessarily to be increased or decreased in frequency, but merely just to keep track of occurrences such as;
	- Video games
	- Movies
	- Blue sky and green grass
	- Trimming nails
	- Mood
	- Shaving etc.
