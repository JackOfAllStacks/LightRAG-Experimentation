# 3. Resources
This is the [[PARA Method - Resource|Resource (PARA)]] element of the [[PARA Method]].
Resources is where the bulk of my [[Obsidian]] Vault will reside. It so far has a few folders pertaining to different [[PARA Method - Area|areas]], which is where notes related to different [[PARA Method - Area|areas]] will be contained. But for all other notes, they will be located in the [[Zettelkasten Directory]], which will be a folder full of a mess of notes, intended to allow the organic production of [[PARA Method - Area|areas]] and links to be made.

## [[Templating]] For Resources
As part of [[Templating]] I am making the [[3. Resource Template]]. This template will be used for any resource created within the [[Resource Directory]] that isn't part of a directory that has a template associated with it. This template is mainly created for the broad strokes of notes to be created within the [[Zettelkasten Directory]].

### Elements for [[Resource Directory|3. Resources]]
