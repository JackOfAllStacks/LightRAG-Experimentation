# Root Directory
**The Root Directory** will have the [[Root Template]] assigned so that in the absence of any other templates, this one will be used. This template should contain universal elements that are desired to be an property of every single note in this vault.

## [[Templating]] For Root Directory
The [[Templating]] process for the **root directory** is straight forward and only requires a few fundamental properties. It just needs to be a skeleton of which all other templates of the vault build upon
The properties are:
- Date and Time of note creation
- Last edited date
- [[Tags]]
- Aliases
