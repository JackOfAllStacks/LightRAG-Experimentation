# Databases
The more I use [[Obsidian]] the more I see potential use cases for using [[Obsidian]] in every aspect of my life. Databases is one of the big ones. I'll be able to keep track of all kinds of things using dataview and making databases of sorts. For example;
- Movies I've watched
- Books I've read
- Games I've played
- People in my life

Databases do not need to be their own part or aspect of my [[Obsidian]] vault, as I will be basing my creation and usage of all [[PARA Method - Area|areas]] of [[Obsidian]] to effectively work as databases through their [[tags]] and metadata. These can mainly just be inspiration for [[Big Areas of Focus]].
