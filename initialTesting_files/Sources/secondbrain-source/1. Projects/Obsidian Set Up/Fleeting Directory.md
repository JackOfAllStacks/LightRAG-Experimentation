# 4. Brain Dump - Fleeting
This is one part of the vault which has yet to be fully defined.

I believe the name will change, but it's purpose will remain. This will be the spot that little ideas are formed in, to later become fully fledged notes at a later time. [[Baby Notes]] should all belong here at first and then later grow up and be put into the appropriate [[Resource Directory]] location.

This should be empty the majority of the time. Once notes are created here, they are to then be worked on to be removed from here and find it's more permanent spot within the vault. **Fleeting Notes** can be sent to [[Archive Directory|6. Archives]] once it has been expanded upon in a **Permanent Note**, and that note can also link back to its first iteration as a **Baby Note**.
