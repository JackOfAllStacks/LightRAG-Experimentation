# Journaling
Journaling is a primary goal of my decision to create a second brain in Obsidian.
These are the types of journaling I will be doing, all residing within [[Journal Directory|5. Journal]]:
- [[Daily Note Outlining]]
- [[Weekly Notes]]
- [[Monthly Notes]]
- [[Quarterly Notes]]
- [[Yearly Notes]]
- [[Magickal Diary]]
- [[Dream Journal]]

## Initial Thoughts from First Draft
Through the combination of some of the things I've mentioned, I would like to bring my journaling activity to Obsidian. I know writing pen on paper is really good and I also really enjoy it, but keeping my journal digital will make it very easy to keep track of, find specific entries and most of all probably motivate me to do it better since my brain moves already at such a fast speed and I often find myself struggling to journal on paper because my brain just wants to vomit it all out, and the speed of handwriting annoys me and prevents me from enjoying the experience as much as I should. With writing journal entries, I can probably get myself to do it daily with the daily note, which can also integrate with some of the other things such as tracking my habits and routines.
