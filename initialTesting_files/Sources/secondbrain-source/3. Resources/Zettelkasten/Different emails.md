# Different Emails
I just had the idea of making heap so emails. Heaps. All different things. Spread my identity around. Have emails automated to share emails around. There must be a way to automate emails coming in to an email to automatically send it out.
I wonder if there's a way to make one over email, where if you delete the emails in, it deletes it from the original.
Maybe you don't even have to delete from the original?
It would be a perfect amount of backup.

This is a chance to change email providers
- ProtonEmail
- Tutanota email
get away from Google's control.
reconstruct my online identity
fragment it
hide it
disguise it
shuffle it
take control back
own it again
