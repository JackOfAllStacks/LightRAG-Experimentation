# 3 Stories Told Simultaneously
I'm getting the feeling that there are multiple stories going on simultaneously. I keep falling into different lenses of looking at the different stories. They're all identical, while all being the same.

The BioShock infinite thing. Infinite lighthouses. "There is always a lighthouse, always a man, always a city."

There can be infinite stories. But there are [[Constants]]. Always a story, always a protagonist, always a world.
