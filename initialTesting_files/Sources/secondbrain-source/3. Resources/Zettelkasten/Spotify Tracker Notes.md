# Spotify Tracker Notes
Idea to make an algorithm or whatever connection is needed to somehow make a tracker for songs I listen to. I find that if I track when in the day I listened to a song, I will better able keep track of when things I are happening to me, as I attribute more importance in the memory of what I was hearing and feeling, than what the time was.

If I make a note that automatically records my daily music habits, then I can keep track of ideas that come up during these songs. Go back to the record and select the note that is for the Song, then on that note I can write ideas that came up through listening to it, and then I can maybe even connect listening to the song as a portal back to that headspace.

If I practice that long enough I'm actually certain I can train myself to travel through the music back to the same headspace and capture ideas again.

**WORTH DOING**
