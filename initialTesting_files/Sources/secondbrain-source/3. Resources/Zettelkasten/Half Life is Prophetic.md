# Half Life is Prophetic
I just saw a "meme" on instagram quoting a scientific article explaining the discover of a "4D Phantom in the CERN Particle Accelerator". This mentioned a phenomenon that causes a resonance and sync up of some phenomena that causes the particles to instead harmonise with a frequency and go a different course than they calculated. This was a hypothetical and mathematical possibility that has now been proved and documented. The ghost exists.

This being mentioned as resonance made the think that perhaps this is the start of a resonance cascade. We should prepare for unforeseen consequences.

This is not the first time I've felt prophetic and noticeable visions of the lore of the Half-Life / Valve universe.

This also was referenced to in the comments but also I thought of, the sophons from the aliens in 3 Body Problem that are sent as tiny quantumnlg entangled super computers condensed down into an individual particle, sent to destroy our science so they can arrive without us developing a way to defeat them. They freeze our technology from advancing.

Aliens or not, this might be the time to start using a different technology. This is where the creativity of our stories seems to end. How do we keep going while continuing these patterns? We don't. We kill ourselves if we don't adapt and evolve. As a species. The unity, the opposite of division. Divide and conquer of work together and live in harmony? We've been plagued by a line of memetics in our consciousness that needs to be evolved to be exterminated, else we go the way of the dodo.

We can evolve together, as a species. We must heal the divide and conquer memetic line. Eat the rich /s... kinda.

Memetics are important, i feel like i can and should learn as much as I can about memetics.
