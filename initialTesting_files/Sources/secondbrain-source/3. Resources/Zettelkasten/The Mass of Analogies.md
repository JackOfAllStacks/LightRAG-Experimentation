# The Mass of Analogies
There is something I have noticed about the use of language that I have correlated with the idea of "densities" in relation to dimensions.
***This are can probably be expanded on and better explained into it's own note***
I've been watching a Youtuber called The Alchemist, and she refers to dimensions (3D, Third Dimension) as densities. This is in respect to the idea that consciousness is in all (This is just a dumb understanding and explanation of my own brain) and that within the parts of reality that we don't see, the metaphysical reality, this "imaginal realm" is in a less dense state than this physical reality is.
I understand this term in reference to her use intuitively, but struggle to represent and explain that understanding.
For example. a physical sphere, is a very dense part of metaphysical reality, so much so that it's density causes a physical sphere to exist. The physical sphere is a very intense and dense *idea* of a sphere.

With this knowledge and understanding, I propose the mass and density of language varies.
This can be somewhat demonstrated through the myth/idea of different types of learners. The visual learners, auditory learners, read and write learners and the hands on approach learners.
I'm getting ahead of myself in order to try and sound smart and like I know what I'm talking about.

I realised that I am someone who has a great benefit in learning something when explained through metaphor or analogy. Not only in the case of learning, but metaphors and analogy, to me, feel like a very artful poetic way to describe to another the understanding of a complex event or knowledge, in a way that others can understand.

Like the act of encapsulating some wisdom or knowledge that one person as into an artistic metaphor or analogy, is a method of encoding wisdom into a smaller transferable form, that another person can project their own view and understanding and lived experience, onto the metaphor and walk away with potential wisdom that would've been harder to achieve otherwise.

I think that words are a less dense mode of transfer knowledge than metaphors and analogies can be.

Sure people are able to read a book or paragraphs about something and have that make sense, and have that knowledge downloaded into their brain, but there's something about differing download methods that provide better responses to the downloads and better retainment potentially.

*this could very easily be measured by a science experiment
hypothesis; metaphors and analogies provide better retainment of knowledge than "conventional learning"
experiment: have knowledge taught to a group of people, some get taught something by various conventional methods, others get taught using analogy and metaphors. Maybe a mix of the two also?*

I propose that by encapsulating and encoding knowledge into an analogy that more closely resembles our physical reality, this creates a scale of density for knowledge transference.
