# Constants
## Fine-tuned Universe

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Physical_constant&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Fine-tuned universe")]

Main articles: [Fine-tuned universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_universe "Fine-tuned universe") and [Anthropic principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle "Anthropic principle")

Some physicists have explored the notion that if the [dimensionless physical constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_physical_constant "Dimensionless physical constant") had sufficiently different values, our Universe would be so radically different that intelligent life would probably not have emerged, and that our Universe therefore seems to be [fine-tuned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_universe "Fine-tuned universe") for intelligent life.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_constant#cite_note-17) The anthropic principle states a logical [truism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truism "Truism"): the fact of our existence as intelligent beings who can measure physical constants requires those constants to be such that beings like us can exist. There are a variety of interpretations of the constants' values, including that of a [divine creator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design "Intelligent design") (the apparent fine-tuning is actual and intentional), or that the universe is one universe of many in a [multiverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse "Multiverse") (e.g. the [many-worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation "Many-worlds interpretation") of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics")), or even that, [if information is an innate property of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_from_bit "It from bit") and logically inseparable from consciousness, a universe without the capacity for conscious beings cannot exist.

This is an excerpt from the physical constraints page of Wikipedia. This accurately describes elements of theories I subscribe to.

It speaks of the many worlds theory, the idea that in the multiverse there are infinite possibilities of outcomes, therefor there exist universes where no life was ever able to form due to it's developed conditions. Such as in everything everywhere all at once, when they experience the rock dimension and it's stated that it never got to a point where life could exist.

It also mentions that for Humans to be able to measure and identify the physical constraints, that those constraints must be so in order for beings to exist. A bit of a a chicken vs the egg situation.
Did the universe evolve in a way so that we could exist, or because we were always meant to exist, did the universe have to evolve that way?
Because linear time as we know doesn't exist, it's hard to answer such a question.

The idea of constants is introduced as soon as something exists. Because an individual story exists, the pattern of what a story is can be replicated, however some constants must be essential to the pattern otherwise you would be creating a new pattern.

Because a narrative story can be told, it implies the existence of other narrative stories also, it is not an object of matter than is unique and one of a kind.
Because the existence of one narrative story being told implies the possibility of other narrative stories being told, one must assume there are constant characteristics of a narrative story, and that this first narrative story must contain the constants within it.

Because there are constants to the creation of a story, there is never an example of someone trying to write a brand new narrative story, only to accidentally write a shopping list instead. As the defining characteristics of a narrative story and a shopping list are comprised of different constant characteristics.

Through the playing around of constants within concepts, we can further identify that everything is a pattern of some kind.

A hero's journey archetypal form of story is just a pattern for a story to take.
One where a hero is called to action against a form of evil or antagonist. This story happens and the hero is even more of a hero then when he began. Sometimes he was not even a hero to begin with.
But in order for the hero to develop into the hero he was destined to be, he was meant to go through the archetypal constants of the story.

Archetype = Constant expressions of the unconscious mind/universe
