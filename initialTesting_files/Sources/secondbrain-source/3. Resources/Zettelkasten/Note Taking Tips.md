# Note Taking Tips
1. Keep the notes short(ish). The idea of writing them as mini essays is a possibility. <500 words
2. Tackle one idea at a time. They're meant to be focused and flexible. Remember the idea of making the notes atomic, so they can be versatile and flexible.
3. Format notes so they're easy to read. Doesn't need to be formatted like an essay, just make it easy for you to read if you need to come back to it. Breaks after sentences that feel appropriate
4. References. Link to other relevant notes on the same topic and any source material too. If you make a note that is on an idea that came from a note you took from a book, reference the note on that book.
