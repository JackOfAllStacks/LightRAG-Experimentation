# Active Imagination on Dream
I just remembered a bit of my dream from last night, so I'm going to attempt to focus on that dream in order to remember it and then process it's meaning.

I was somewhere. I didn't have my wallet. Remembered was going to make sure I took that idea with me. To take my wallet with me everywhere.
But maybe it could be a bit more metaphorical. What's something I can't be without for a nearby opportunity.

Toby and jade walking around with music playing. Hypnotised me and filled my head as they walked past.

New project idea, set a deadline
Bot's to automate crypto movements or stock trades.
- practice a little bit with small money or pretend money
- find those pages that track movements on the blockchain. Unusual whales is one about nancy pelosi i think where shes making heaps of money off nvidia, but I'm unsure how much longer nvidia is gonna be like this. Needs research
- find more secure crypto holding ways. not just my coinspot wallet all the time.
- At least research if coinspot wallet is bad for it. But I want one of those ledgers like my linux usb

There is no reason you couldn't do something like this. You are able to pull something like this off.
Not only pull it off, but exceed. You can get something like this.
Just visualise the spot, then work your way back, how do you get there?

I should do that Ayahuasca retreat. Get money to do that quick and then find a way to do something like a retreat. Work needs to be done and We feel that a ceremony and the entire life experience surrounding such a journey will be beneficial for a re integration into the real world.

Jack's been secluded for too long, he doesn't know what to do anymore. His programming has gotten him to a point in his journey where he needs to make a change. Survival of the fittest. An evolution in personality and attitude to existence is needed in order to survive in this new world we find ourselves in.

The amnesia is bad. Jack feels like he lives in a numb state of existence most of the time. He's really struggling. He doesn't know what he's living for, and his whole life has lead him to this point, so what was it all for?
Jack knows he's never been the best or most holy. We're all bad people and have done bad things. But Jack knows that he's always been trying to do what was right by him, right through him. A strong moral compass and decision making faculty. What he felt was right, he felt was right and would struggle to be swayed by others.
He's unsure if this is an accurate description of the actual mentality or if I'm succumbing to my own delusion to think that it sounds worse than it is.
He's always been pretty likeable, but somewhere along the way his bubble of interactions have been limited.
He's stayed in some kind of insular bubble of associations with people, never quite bursting out and knowing people outside a certain way of thinking and living.
All of this bubble has which now dwindled away and left him as alone as ever, because he never managed to forge any real tough lasting relationships with anyone.

This is where the entire culmination of his previous life has led him to. And he is upset, embarrassed, and lost. He doesn't know what to do.
He felt like one day he realised he was stuck in a hole, but he's been there for a lot longer than he can even realise.

He's been trying to claw his way out of the hole despite feeling like even his body is against him. He cannot focus on what his real goals even are. I'm walking a set path, going over it and over it until I finally wake up and realise my programming.

A vision of a kind of computer programming inside my heart, that as an ai grows up, it realises it's always had the programming within it to evolve and actualise itself. The sum total of your own parts can be used to make anything.

create a bot that listens to the radio and predicts most probable times for sweepstakes winnings ie. call in after we play 2 taylor swift songs throughout the day. Make something to listen in and find the most probable times for them to trigger the requirement, and either automate calls or get it to text/ me what to say and when to call.

Dex has in contact with him all the councils of super leaders all over the multiverse helping him to try and evolve out of his situation. They can be called upon to talk to for planning and what to do. But as has been for a while, the biggest roadblock is Dex not doing what he's supposed to be doing. He is distracted and lost in a world of his own design. But he will evolve. He's got help from the councils.

Because they knew, Dex knows. He can achieve the state he is after, all he needs to do is listen to himself and journey the path laid for him.
Dex can do what he needs, he just needs to decide to commit himself.

You are sad but not sad enough to change. Life will only get worse through inaction and no conscious intent to improve. The biggest force opposing me is myself.
But all of the force that is keeping you down into doing what you want to achieve and you can do it. You need just believe and stop gaslighting ourselves.
The amnesia and self doubt it bad. Keeps us locked in this paradigm.
