# Ego Needs to Be Controlled
All of our problems seem to stem from the ego. The ego needs to be the small working part of a larger system. We need to disconnect from the ego and have it work for something bigger than itself. It needs to be the Sisyphus pushing the boulder up the hill. One day we will reach the top of the hill, but we need to push that boulder every day before we can see that point.
