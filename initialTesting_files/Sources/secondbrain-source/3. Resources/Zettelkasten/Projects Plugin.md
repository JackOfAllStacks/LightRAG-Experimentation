# Projects Plugin
**The Projects Plugin** is a plugin I have for [[Obsidian]] that allows me to manage and visualise my [[PARA Method - Project|Projects (PARA)]] in different and more effective ways.
It has the ability to select a folder as a main project folder, and then all notes created are made automatically within the folder.
When a folder is selected, it is able to represent the projects files in ways such as;
- Table
- Board
- Calendar
- Gallery
All of which show the information within the notes in different ways that are useful in different scenarios.
