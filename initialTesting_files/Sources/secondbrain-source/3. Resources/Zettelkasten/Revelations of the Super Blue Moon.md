Existence as a whole may not follow exact mathematical laws as I'm no mathematician, but this can be viewed as a mathematical approach to understanding metaphor and symbolism, or at least an intended representation of my ideas within my own mind.

Existence as one could logically say is the fact of matter that one would supposed exists. Basically you exist, or you don't. In a binary sense this is a 1 or 0 state that any pieces of data or information could be attributed. In a systematic hypothetical of trying to measure every since individual bit of a universe, it could either be a 0 or a 1 on a very fundamental level. Then as we increase the rate at which we draw distinctions, increase the frequency of more information that can be attributed to those bits, we increase the resolution. So first we determine whether something exists or doesn't (0 or 1), then we can determine whether it's white or black, then whether it has parts of red blue or green in it. As we do this we slowly build up the resolution of defining things until we see them as we humans do, individual things with very distinct edges and defining features and dubiously "obvious" starts and stops between things. Science, and humanities entire journey has been one of discovery. Discovery of the world around us, finding ways to utilise the world around us, for good or bad. Mostly bad. Think of science in the way of atoms and electrons and then chemical compounds and then things that are alive or not, the different sizes and stages of cellular size and complex machinery of the biological world. There's all this ways of defining our world, and science has had the great position within our society that gets to the minutia of things. Where we humans see a chair, the scientist knows that at first the perception is of a chair, then at a more zoomed in lens we see that it's a thing that is made up of a lot of wood, then we zoom in again, you see one piece of wood, then you zoom in again and you see carbon atoms, then you zoom in again and you see what an carbon atom is built of, neutrons and electrons and protons, then from there you start smashing these guys into smaller and smaller bits of yesses or noses, until you see the parts that come together to build our universe. This thought brings to mind the ides that we started to be noticed by entities within the universe as we got to a noticeable level of knowledge through destruction. Divide and conquer, creation through destruction, submission and domination. We were given fire by Prometheus so that we would use the God fire of Olympus to ascend the need for such gods. This was Prometheus's decision to go against the word of the ruler of the realm of the gods, the leader of the heavens. Zeus did not want us to have the fire from their higher realm or plane of existence as we would get to a point where we no longer needed them. We are living through those times, we live within a godless world, because we are going on without them, we have no need for them and so we do not worship them, and thus they fall away as background characters and myth to the knowledge of mankind. Or this is like Adam and eve within the garden of Eden, this little pocket dimension of reality where god made us as toys with not the same kind of consciousness as we do, but something much more dull. The eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge, man is cast out of gods kingdom and thrust into a reality of their own, and as we know seem to know, a reality of their own creation. But gods exist alright, we have just developed to a point where we don't need to pray to gods, they're "beneath us" metaphorically and on the perspective of humanities masculine egotistic view of the idea. If God created man with the metaphor of building us a playground to exist within, and that's about the extension. But through obtaining some sort of higher truth of the reality he existed in, he discovered that he lived within a sandbox within a desert, perhaps even within a sandbox, sandboxes all the way down. But we became aware of at least the sandbox above us, and that we were manufactured and held within constraints. The knowledge of the gods, Prometheus's fire of Eden's fruit from the tree of knowledge, allowed us to see past the a truth we couldn't even fathom previously. How could man know he was within a sandbox when he did not know he was in a sandbox? Or that he thought he was within a desert, there was no indication of where the boundaries were or what they were withholding him to. You do not know you are not allowed to play on a swing if you do not know a swing exists. Imagine telling a child that a swing exists, "you mean there's this seat I can sit, and you push me back and forth and I get higher and higher?". I mean I can even imagine my own childlike wonder at the discovery of such an invention. Upon discovery, we want to do it. Well how many things exist that we want to discover and do, but we do not even know we can discover it? The mystery.

*Are thinking these thoughts good for me?*
**I think so, at the very least it seems like an artistic expression of some kind, although with minimal amounts of art infused in said expression. But these are the kinds of thoughts that I strive to think. The question of whether these thoughts are good for me can perhaps be overridden by the question of whether these thoughts are right for me, and I believe they are.**

## Post Writing Thoughts 01:50
It feels like getting a peak through the veils of reality, somehow I can find a frequency in which my brain will ponder such thoughts and have such information shown to me. It feels like I am getting innate information transmitted to me that isn't so much me thinking these thoughts and "discovering" something, but more that I am tuning into said knowledge and decoding it all into a way I can explain to myself and perhaps others.

A big underlying aspect to this journey is the doubt in myself. The doubt as to whether what I'm experiencing is real or not, whether I'm going crazy or not. It feels like a sane person in a mad world would go insane. It's a battle I've been fighting and in fact, could have something to do with the spiritual amnesia and forms of amnesia I've been experiencing. It's such a hard time that My unconscious thinks a thought and can then transfer those memories and knowledge into the unconscious mind in order to forget or not stress the conscious mind in thinking those thoughts.
