# 741 Synchronicity
Just had a meaningful coincidence where i saw 741 as the time when my computer crashed on shut-down and instead restarted and the numbers "741" showed up as the time.

741 is a number that I associate with the Gamestop Stock. In the "superstonk" subreddit I know they have some meaning to the number. I don't know the exact meaning, but I believe they associate it with GME going to the moon as part of the MOASS.

I've seen them making posts referencing meaningful coincidences of that number showing up to them. So I'm just going to note it down here as a possible synchronicity. I figure this should be a new thing I can do. That's exactly what I'm figuring Obsidian is for.

So this date is now noted, and if gamestop does go up soon from this date, at least that's a possible synchronicity or indication.

Or a possible reason to get money back into Gamestop. Depending on how much I believe in such a meaningful coincidence.
