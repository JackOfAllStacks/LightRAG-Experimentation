# Retail Slide and Script
Previous slide is [[Key AI Technologies Slide and Script]]

## Script
Stitch Fix is an innovative online personal styling service that provides customers with personalized clothing selections delivered right to their door.
They remove the need for a stylist by collecting and using datapoints from their customers in combination with their AI stylists collaborating with their human stylists.

Stich fix leverages AI to enhance their customer experience through several key strategies.

**First, personalization with data.** By combining customer information gathered from style quizzes with advanced AI algorithms, Stitch Fix curates tailored clothing selections that align closely with individual preferences.

**Then they've got predictive analytics.** The company analyses trends and customer behaviour to optimize inventory and anticipate demand, ensuring they stock what customers want.

**Importantly, thereâ€™s a collaboration between AI and human stylists at Stitch Fix.** Currently, human stylists play a vital role in adding a personal touch to the AI-generated recommendations. However, as AI technology continues to evolve, we may see a future where the reliance on human stylists diminishes, allowing AI to take on a more dominant role in the styling process.
There may be a time in the near future where the Ai not only manages to function at Stitch Fix without the human counterparts, but may even surpass their human stylists.

Here we can see Stitch Fix demonstrating how AI can be used to revolutionize personalized shopping but also it serves as a compelling example of AI's impact in the **retail** industry.
