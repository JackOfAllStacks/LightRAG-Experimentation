# Intro Slide and Jack Slide Script
## Script
Good morning everyone. My name is Jack Di Iorio, and I'm excited to be here in front of you today to discuss the ways in which Artificial Intelligence is transforming the customer experience across various industries.

Now firstly I just want to touch on who I am.
I'm a strategic thinker with a passion for technology and problem solving.
I studied various fields of computer science at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, including cyber security, software engineering, and programming

I bring strong strategic thinking, which allows me to approach challenges from fresh perspectives. My analytical mindset helps me break down complex problems and find effective solutions, while my communication and presentation skills ensure I convey ideas clearly and confidently.

In recent years, Iâ€™ve developed a strong fascination with AI and have explored the ways in which it can enhance my quality of life.
Now, I want to bring it to the rest of the world, showcasing how AI is transforming the way we live.
