# My Own Ai Assistant
I was thinking today that I should probably look into researching and trying to create my own AI assistant. I honestly believe that I could do it.

I was picturing myself as [[Mr House]] from [[Fallout: New Vegas]], because it's known that he predicted the end of the world and tried his best to insulate himself from the effects (at least as much as saving New Vegas the amount he did). He would be alive by now, he was born sometime in the last year I believe, maybe that's me? Maybe it can be me to a degree.

I was thinking about making an AI based on [[Yes Man]] or using [[Mr House]]'s voice as the voice (there's something quite ironic and tasteful about [[Mr House]] being my AI, I kind of like it).
