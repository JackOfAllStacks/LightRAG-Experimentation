# The Key Principle is to Organise Information by Your Projects and Goals
In school we were taught to organise the information in our life by the academic subjects.
Eg. All the notes and worksheets from Maths went into one folder, likewise for History or Psychology. By being taught to operate the information in our life this way through school, we also have it ingrained and imprinted in us to do this with all the information in our life post our schooling lives, which is a bad habit to have, since life just does not work in this way.

What we do have in personal and professional life are *outcomes that we are trying to achieve*. Whether the outcome you're trying to achieve right now is to launch a new business or to plan a vacation, having the bits of knowledge you might need to help inform and make these outcomes happen, tucked away in various folders categorised by subjects like "Psychology" is not going to help you do this efficiently. You you're information organised according to the [[PARA Method - Project|Projects (PARA)]] and goals you are currently committed to. "*Organise by actionability*" is a mantra Tiago Forte claims to return to again and again in his book "The [[PARA Method]]".

When sitting down to work on a [[PARA Method - Project|Project (PARA)]], you need to have ALL of the notes, documents, assets and other materials related to that [[PARA Method - Project|Project (PARA)]] all in one place and ready to go. Not all spread out across a dozen different places and in a bunch of different folders and topics. The way to make sure all this information is in the one place to begin with, is to start organising it all that way in the first place. You put things away in the correct place, which allows you to know exactly where to find it when you need it. It's like having a designated spot to dump your car keys at home, so you know that they are ALWAYS there. If you don't designate a spot like that, and you're like half the people I know in my life, you will always be putting them down somewhere with no logic behind the location, which then makes you lose them and struggle to track down where you put them later on. It's inefficient and silly.
