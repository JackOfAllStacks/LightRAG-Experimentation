# Psyop Attack Idea
I had an idea for a kind of [[Psyop]] attack that I might be able to orchestrate. My first victim when coming up with the idea was radio and the shitty radio shows we listen to now, but this plan could ultimately be used in many areas.

The idea came from the fact that car talk radio shows are of such low quality, that it feels like it could be AI generated. That lead me to the conclusion that if something feels like it could be AI generated, then it may as well be. Calling on [[Alan Turing's]] [[Turing Test]] where if an AI can be convincing enough that it could be a human, then it may as well be.
It's the same the other way round. Any content that is indistinguishable from AI is therefore no better for the human condition than AI slop might be. It's all brain rot, whether man made or AI made. If you cannot tell the difference, then what does that say about the content you are consuming.

This is a message that could be conveyed through meta-level awareness.
Say I make a (false) claim that the Kylie and Jackie-O show is AI. I'm thinking make a shitty Tik Tok about it and provide some fake, but compelling evidence that it is AI. I came up with the idea to artificially insert some tell-tale signs that audio is AI, INTO real conversations from the radio. I'm aware that AI has some signs that can be spotted in audio wave form (or at least I think I've heard that somewhere), so this gives me a sense of authority and trustworthiness to the average plebian that might see such a Tik Tok.

Sure there is a population who might see through my grift, but they will be smaller than the convinced masses. Using some kind of bots or some system to artificially inflate the situation, I might be able to raise it to a level of controversy. If it comes to a controversy, I want to be called out for lying, that enables act 2.

Act 2 is where I have actually managed to train an AI to produce talk show bits the same way the car radio does, and I prove that the fact that no one could tell I was lying, goes to show the level of quality of the actual radio shows. Hopefully this wakes some people up to the AI slop or man made equivalents. The idea I have for the [[Ai Girl]] created for OnlyFans for me, also could line up into this story being told. I'm taking advantage of the suckers who fall for it, and what's so different about me doing it and using an AI Girl compared to the real girls doing it to you?

A whole story structure can be planned out to maximise the effects of the story, and a story can be crafted to suit any target potentially.

This could be a kind of attack I can put out there.
