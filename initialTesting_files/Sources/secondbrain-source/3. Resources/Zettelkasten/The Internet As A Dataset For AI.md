# The Internet as a Dataset for Ai
The thing about fake bot accounts and real accounts, is that the internet is riddled by low conscious actions.
If 99% of the population is unconscious 99.9999% of the time, then a good percentage of the internet as a collective content is unconscious actions.
This is not to discount the idea that humans cannot create and output consciously at all with such percentages, but that the implication is that a lot of the internet is shit.

The human made part of the internet is full of shit. Don't even think of the fact that we know a good chunk of the internet is ai, algorithms, and spam. Just the human part is full of dumb people producing the most noise. The vocal minority. This is because the vocal minority can see a space to spread the opinion they hold, without saying it to anyone's face, and producing noise about a topic. Anyone that is not getting vocal about their opinions is not creating content to the internet Dataset.

You can't make something smart out of dumb. Or can you?
