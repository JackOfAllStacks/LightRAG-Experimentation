# Reality Checks
Hourly watch timer/reminder
- Am I dreaming?
- Do I have a shadow?
- Do I cast a reflection in mirrors and surfaces?
- Check watch/time twice for consistency and persistence
- Look at clock on wall twice to see if the time changes
- Jump and see if you can fly or super jump

Every time you walk through a doorway or turn a corner, look for dreamsigns
