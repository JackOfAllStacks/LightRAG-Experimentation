# Psychedelic Experiences
Psychedelia is a term meaning psyche as mind, and delia as expanding.
Psychedelic experiences and substances are coined as such for their expanding of mind effects. I have heard of people comparing travel as one of the most psychedelic experiences you can do. I would agree, and since thinking of the portals through consciousness, I can further explain how this is so.

Your location is not only confined to your location in space and time. There is also the mental plane which needs to be taken into account to determine location.
Physically, you can be in your bedroom. In time that might be the 23rd of August 2024, but as we now time does not exist in that way, and there is only truly the ever present.
For the sake of this argument however it's hardly the point. You can be in your bedroom on the 23rd and that experience and location in the universe is not the same as being in your bedroom a year ago.

"No man steps in the same river twice, for he is not the same man, and the river is not the same river"

While accounting for you physical location in space and time, there is also the headspace you are in. You could be crying at one event because you are listening to sad music and it's bringing out sad emotions. Or you can be in your room laughing your head off because you are playing video games on a computer.

These take in the mental plane too. This is the headspace. Psychedelic substances and the like usually expand your mind entirely through the headspace. The same as meditation. But you expand your mind also whenever you travel to new physical spaces too.

Being in Italy was a very different location compared to Australia, and so I learnt a lot about being in such a new environment. It was another world to what I knew. So you expand your mind to make new room for new situations and new information in your experience. The same can be said for travelling into psychedelic headspaces through the use of mushrooms or LSD for example.
These are vastly different locations compared to the usual headspace you are in and so everything feels and seems so foreign and novel. But this effect is no different than traveling to as alien a place as you can in the physical world. Imagine your consciousness trying to cope an adapt to the life and world of poor Indian folk for example? It's such a foreign experience that you would be expanding your mind immensely in order to try and adapt and take in the new information.

From these distinctions we can then ultimately conclude, that psychedelia is the expanding of the mind in order to intake foreign inputs from foreign experiences. Location in time and space irrelevant to the mind's headspace. This is because the physical realm does not exist the way we believe it does.
Everything comes from mind. It is all consciousness
