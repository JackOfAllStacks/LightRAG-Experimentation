# The Path of Realisation
I can see the path through life that causes everything to be just the way it needs to be.

Consider the idea of a genius, with a natural gift and intuitive intelligence, who lives the first 23 years of his life surrounded by, and taught by idiots. There is something in the child's brain that makes them want to believe for a time that the adults know what they're doing and that they're smart. I think most people growing up remember a time in their life where it suddenly switched and we realised that adults have no fucking clue what they're doing, or at the very least, the mere fact that they are older did not inherently provide any decision they make any more merit on the basis of age alone.
Age!= Wisdom

An intelligent person growing up with humility and control over their ego, perhaps some trauma with belief that their opinion is wrong, or some trauma that leads this individual to believe that his thoughts and feelings and opinions are lesser than others.

There's an almost intelligent and deliberate path that this persons consciousness goes through in order to make them into the person they ARE or need to be.

The butterfly effect is in place here too. If any one tiny minuscule fact of the matter in the path changed, the entire course of the path would too. The statistics and probability are so astronomically high that there is no other way to describe the outcome of our universe and lives other than to be intelligently designed and laid out for us.

**Everything is exactly as it should be**
