# Everything Everywhere All at once
Consciousness shifts it's location in the multiverse as in the movie Everything Everywhere All At Once.
The way they send consciousness to far away probable realties, then they combine themselves with the other conscious to automatically learn whatever they know.

We all now exist simultaneously in all dimensions. We never really go anywhere else, but instead shift our consciousness to perceiving and experiencing other dimensions. This includes perceiving higher dimensions, all depending on how energetically clear we are while embodied.

From a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/starseeds/comments/1ez018o/has_anyone_ever_ascended_to_their_star_self_and/) that prompted me to write this note.

"We all now exist simultaneously in all dimensions. This means that we don't really ever "go" anywhere, instead our consciousness shifts to perceiving and experiencing the higher dimensions (5D+) depending on how energetically clear we are while embodied. So, although you had this higher dimensional experience, you can bring it to Earth right now if you remain clear of 4D attachments and work to release what may be obscuring your 5D+ perception at this time.

Life is not supposed to be "hell." That is a perception. We are multidimensional beings who create our reality every second by our thoughts and our actions. We can create joy if we wish. Suffering is caused by energetic imbalance which can be addressed and brought to balance so we can exist here in a state of peace. I'm not saying this is always easy, but we starseeds are here to hold balance, to be fully grounded on Earth so we can receive, hold, and anchor higher vibrational frequencies on the planet, and in doing so we, too, evolve in consciousness.

My advice to help you to adjust is to intend to be shown how to embody your starseed self here on Earth, and if this is what you need, most-likely your family will provide this information. And then you can experience the energies of the higher dimensions while living a grounded and fulfilling life here. This was the original intent for humanity, to live as [[Consciously Multidimensional Beings]]. The more of us that embody this, the more humanity is helped in restoring its original Divine template. You make a difference, and I wish you well üôè"
