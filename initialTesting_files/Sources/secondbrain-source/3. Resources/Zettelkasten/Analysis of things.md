# Analysis of Things
## A$AP Rocky's New Song and Music Video Tailor Swif
Watching this video game felt like it started off obviously being a real production, until it slowly kept emulating the videos that AI makes, with obvious VFX sprinkled through. But as I got further and further into the video I questioned more and more if it was real at all. Was the whole thing an AI produced video with all the randomness it can provide?
At the end it listed credits and showed "BTS" footage so it seems it was a real production and produced with real people.
However this itself played into a thought I had.
That in a closed environment, with enough power and influence, reality can be whatever you want. There was a lot of people involved, and A$AP Rocky was able to mould reality into his vision of this music video. Despite the craziness and effort and people needed, he pulled it off.
This feel analogous to real life, as if he was showing a demonstration of how the real world works.
The title being "Tailor Swif" is an obvious homage to Taylor Swift, who is a juggernaut in the industry and world at the moment.
With lyrics along the lines of "don't let Tailer know what I'm doing, I'm too swift" it felt like there's deeper meaning to be found here. Meaning that I got a glimpse of.
Further investigation required.

## Kinds of Kindness
I watched this movie a couple of days before seeing the Tailer Swif video, and it felt like my interpretation of said music video was influenced by ideas and interpretations I had when watching this movie.
As a more total piece of art, there was a lot of deliberate decisions I felt I was seeing, that were hinting at something more.
There were scenes in the movie that I was seeing geometry and patterns and circles in the way the seen was shot and set up.
There were focal points at a spot in the scene that was lit up, with your eye going there first, and slowly moving around and out from there. Get screenshots of the movie and analyse for circles and patterns.

As well as previously mentioned, there were also very intense feelings about other aspects of the movie.
- An anthology of stories with the same actors but different characters. But perhaps the characters are the same, but they are playthings for the god of this world Willem Dafoes character. There were obvious signs of testing and cults and everything being formulated by Willem Dafoe in order for characters to learn certain lessons. All in the name of "purifying" the water in these people. When Emma Stones character was raped, it was a failure on her purity and the husbands. They had to be taken to the sauna and the toxins had to be sweat out of them. This process of being put in the sauna was also seen throughout the movie to be a tool to eat the pure people. I think also to mind wipe the unpure people, give a new name and character to, and another role to play in the next story. Analyse the story on deeper levels to see what is REALLY being said.
