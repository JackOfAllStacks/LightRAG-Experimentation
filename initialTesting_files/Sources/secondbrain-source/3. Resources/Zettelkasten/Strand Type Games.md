# Strand Type Games
I remember that I've previously come to revolutions about Hideo Kojima and his games. Especially Death Stranding. I've just had a connection I needed to write down.

The way the strand type multiplayer experience in Death Stranding is analogy of our reality.
It's all a single player story. We're all out here trying to do our own missions, be our own protagonists in our stories. But we're never alone, and other people in our lives are also obviously featuring and helping you out.

In Death Stranding, you can craft a truck in your world, park it somewhere, and it might end up in someone else's world for them to use too. Your world sends a strand out to someone else in order to help them too.

Imagine rock climbing, using carabiners and rope to climb up a mountain. You get there "first", it's an empty bare mountain, as you climb you leave little checkpoints. You hammer into the rock and leave a roped dangling down, you use this checkpoint up until you no longer need it, and you leave this strand behind.

Now someone else comes to climb this mountain later, they can use your strands as stepping stones to help them on their journey too. You have extended a helping hand or strand through space and time from your own private single player world, and helped someone else in their private single player world.

What a genius implementation. Truly innovative.
I stand by what I thought previously, anyone who fucks with Kojima and Death Stranding is ok in my book.
