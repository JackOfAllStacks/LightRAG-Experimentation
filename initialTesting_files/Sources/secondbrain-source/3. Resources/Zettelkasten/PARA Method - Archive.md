# Archive
**Archive** is the second A in the [[PARA Method]] style of organising.
An **Archive** can be defined as *"Inactive items from the other three categories"*.

The **Archive** is the final location to send anything from the previous 3 categories that are no longer *active*, but that you don't want to delete and should be kept around for future reference.
Examples;
- Any projects that have been completed or put on hold for the time being
- Any areas that are no longer *active* or *relevant*
- Resources that you no longer care about
