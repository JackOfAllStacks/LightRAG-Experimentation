# Arcs and Eras
Just had an idea while working on the people tags. I'm trying to classify where I know people from in my life by groups and eras. I've started with childhood, and teenage, maybe there's different eras and names for eras in the past, but I was thinking of naming eras for the foreseeable future.

As I change, my circles and people in my life will also change. So why not come up with names for eras and events perhaps to help with my own feeling of movement through time, but also for keeping track of people and when they've been met, or when they were relevant to my life.

There might need to be a limit it to it somewhere though, as long time personnel like my family will end up accumulating eras.
Scratch that, just limit it to main characters of periods right? Like now dad is in this era, but while I was moved out I would say he was more of a background character, and not core
