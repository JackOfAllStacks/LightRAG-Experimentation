# God
## God as a Unity
God is the term I use to describe the Ultimate Divinity. When referring to "God" I am meaning the unitary source of all, with all dualities of existence being united.
God is not male or female, masculine or feminine, positive or negative. But just the sourceless source. The origination of all.
