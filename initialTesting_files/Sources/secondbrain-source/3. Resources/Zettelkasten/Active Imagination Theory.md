# Active Imagination Theory
- Invite the unconscious in, can drop the formalities later after developing a rapport
- Write a transcript of sorts during the active imagination
	- Pen and Paper is probably optimal considering the lack of distraction and the ability to partake in the active imagination wherever, not confined to a desk where the computer is set up
	- Digitally. Using my laptop the ability to take the notes wherever is not lost. Part of me really thinks doing it through obsidian instead of paper will prove fruitful in the long wrong if we develop the ability to use the laptop efficiently
	- Audio transcript is another option. Recording essentially a conversation with myself. Follow up research can be to play and listen to the conversation after it's happened for further thought
- Do not withhold any deep questions. Do not hold back anything. Express yourself as authentically as you can to the mirror so you can get as real a reflection as you can.
- You are only lying to yourself, you are only hiding from your shadow. Your ego is afraid of what is to come, but it needs to be done, so face it with courage and brevity
