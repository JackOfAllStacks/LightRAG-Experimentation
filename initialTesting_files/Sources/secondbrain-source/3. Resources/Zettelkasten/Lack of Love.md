# Lack of Love
I just analysed myself to see the way lack of love has held back my development.

Lack of love has caused me to live a sheltered, ego life. My consciousness has thus lived its life confined to an expression of life through life that lacked love.
The lack of love perpetuates cycles of lack of love forever.
Create loveless mothers that received loveless lives, and fathers who are always kept to bottle up and not learn how to express themselves. This cycle continues. Generational Trauma.

Add in the society we find ourselves in, this capitalist machine

# Personal
I don't text online or communicate much online because I also don't communicate much in person. Talking online feels very intimate into my psyche and conversations feel of a more intimate nature. Like a side I don't show to many people.

Because of this, I find it hard to maintain conversations and relationships online. Because it's hard online, it's hard in real life to. It's hard in me. It's all a reflection of my inner state.

I've not been shown love growing up, which has conditioned my consciousness to behave a certain way. After the imprint is placed, or the imprinted trauma at least (talking in the sense of the circuits),

I've not been shown love which has made me unaware of what love is. Leading to me living a loveless life.

I believe I may have problems with self worth. This may relate to lack of confidence with myself.

I need to learn what love is, then learn to love myself the way I deserved. Then I can output love that radiates from within me and my life. Not an emulation of love from a loveless being.
