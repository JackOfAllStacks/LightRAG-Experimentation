# Resource
**Resource** is the R in the [[PARA Method]] style of organising.
A **Resource** can be defined as *"Topics or interests that may be useful in the future"*.

**Resource** is the location for the range of topics you're interested in and learning about. It seems like most things go here.
Some examples are;
- Graphic design
- Personal productivity
- Notetaking
- Breathwork
- Habit formation
- Psychology
- Philosophy
- Physics

These examples more closely resemble [[PARA Method - Area|Areas]], but there is a distinction between the [[PARA Method - Area|Area]] and the **Resources** belonging to that [[PARA Method - Area|Area]].
