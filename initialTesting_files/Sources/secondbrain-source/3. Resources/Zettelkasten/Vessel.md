# Vessel
I've been getting a vision of my consciousness and physical body as a type of vessel for consciousness to pour into, and exert upon it types of awareness. The kinds of altered states of consciousness such as the flow state, deep focus, or doom scrolling in the internet. Using "*IN*" the internet because we should be referring to our time in that space as an embarked upon journey into a foreign level of consciousness with different rules.
As Erick Godsey calls it, "The Shimmer".

Music is one way of changing the energyspace of the individual. The music of the external world pours into us and changes our energy levels accordingly. Weed seems to very much pull me into it, I get a clear sense of being in the music/the music in me. This duality shifts slightly, I become the music more instead of the music being something "I" am listening to.
The awareness shifts and can perceive emotions and feelings and a different perspective on consciousness.
