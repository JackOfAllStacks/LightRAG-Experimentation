# Ai Girl
Had an idea to make one of those ai girls to automate a type of business for me.
Put some effort behind it, and with the way things are atm, I reckon I could easily make some money.

Needs to be created moneywise after completely online persona transfer and fragmentation.
Not sure if something like this is explicitly legal, and if the money should he tracked back to me or not, tax evasion wise and such.
But could be done, especially via some crypto shenanigans.
