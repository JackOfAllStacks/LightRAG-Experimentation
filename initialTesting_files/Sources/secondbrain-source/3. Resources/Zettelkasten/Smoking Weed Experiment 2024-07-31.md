# Smoking Weed Experiment
Today we've smoked weed.
Setting intention today to program myself

Pushing through fear of synchronicities
heart and chest pounding
thinking world is gonna end again
heart really strong
gonna walk

was just getting ready, doing anything else to distract the mind from fear helps
instead of sitting in thoughts. need nice area and body busy.

[[The Matrix as we know it]]
[[Messages of Doom]]

Went for a walk to the library, going to try and focus new energy
using the rebal works and we need more practice before it's more safe. Just a hypothesis.

## Notes from a Later Date, 2024-08-03
*This experiment was sloppy and not recorded the way it should be in the future. My Obsidian vault still not being set up completely made it not be organised the way I would ultimately like. Next time, make note of the time started, and record minutes of the experiment and when things are happening. This was sloppy*
