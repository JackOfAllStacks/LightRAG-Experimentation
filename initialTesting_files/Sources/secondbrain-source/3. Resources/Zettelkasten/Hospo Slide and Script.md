## Script
The example of AI being integrated into the Domino's pizza making and checking process is a great example of AI enhancing customer experience in the fast food industry.

This article was posted to investors.dominos.com.au on the 19th of July 2019. The technology spoken of in this article and showcased at Domino's is merely a taste of the kind of AI implementation that can be used in our year of 2024, as AI has become better and more widely available since then.

**Domino's DOM AI tool ensures quality assurance by automatically checking pizzas for accuracy and quality before they leave the kitchen.** This significantly reduces human errors, ensuring that each pizza meets the high standards customers expect. The tool not only minimizes mistakes in toppings and presentation but also speeds up the overall delivery process, enhancing efficiency.

**Moreover, by consistently delivering high-quality products, Domino's builds customer trust and loyalty.** The real-time feedback collected on customer preferences allows for continuous improvement, ensuring that their offerings remain aligned with customer desires.

Domino's integration of AI technology in their operations exemplifies how embracing AI can revolutionize the customer experience in the fast food and hospitality industry, setting a new standard for quality and service that can be replicated across various sectors.
