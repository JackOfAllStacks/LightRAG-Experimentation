# No Country for Old Men Notes
I just had an idea. Anton Chigurh has a conversation with the accountant of the office building.
Acountant: "Are you gonna kill me now?"
Chigurh: "Well that depends. Do you see me?"

I felt that this line can obviously be interpreted as "Are you gonna go along and not tell anyone I was here? Or do I need to kill you because you'll tell people?"
But I see another more magickal way to interpret it.
He means "Do you see me as I am?". Like the power of reality is by not having your true self be seen. I already believe this in some regard, hence **I can feel that the movie is communicating it with me**.
This is because I am all. I came from everything, from the divine, from creation. Because I know it, I am trying to remind myself it by interpreting from the reality around me. That's what the Matrix is.
The magickal term of sphere of protection around me. It's this bubble around me, my vision and senses. That is my reality.
Because I come from the divine, the place outside of time, I know all. Reality is the universe discovering itself, but it already exists. It already knows what it is, it has just forgotten and is in the process of learning that all is one again. That's what all the spiritual stuff of "all is one" really means.

So I know everything, but I can look for the patterns from my sphere of reality to be communicated to. It's kinda as simple as that. I am communicating with myself, through the reality around me. That's what synchronicities are. A nudge in the right direction from the universe/yourself.
