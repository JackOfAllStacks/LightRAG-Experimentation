# Jez through Comparison
I can use Jez's story as an analogy of my own.
Taking her for a walk is peaceful. Not because she's experiencing anything special, but the mere act of experiencing at all is worth it to live for.
The act of not experiencing some future event us not a point of sadness. It should be an enjoyable journey where you learn things you didn't know before.
Ignorance is bliss. And we're all ignorant of something. So just enjoy the bliss while you have it.
Cherish every moment for they are fleeting.
No man steps in the same part of a river twice. For he is not the same man, and the river is not the same part of the river anymore.
We are patterns and the world is patterns around us. But the stuff is never the same stuff.
Every 7 years all of your cells are replaced, ship of Theseus.

Jez has also hurt her leg, which we already have previously aligned somehow with a mirrored experience of our own. That I am slightly psychicly hurt, perhaps more considering the severity of jez's injury. Tho she may or may not realise it, there is a world of difficulty coming her way, with anaesthetic and surgery and then the following healing period trapped in a cage for 8 weeks.
But ultimately we know it is for her best. That she must suffer now in order to suffer less in the future.
She doesn't know any pain is coming, let alone that it's for her best, lest she suffer more later.
Human experience is no different.
The journey we walk is not alone. It is with the universe too.
Everything breathes together, everything exists at the same time as one another. There is no time, only the ever present now
