# What Does it Imply
Managed reality can be seen by looking through the implication of base reality. Do logical game theory esc thinking of what is "allowed".

What does a story being told imply about that reality?

Don't get stuck on layer 1 of the lies. Look through the lies to see the further lies, until you slowly unravel the truth.

Like looking through a window. 2 people looking at a window, 1 may see the reflection, while the other sees through the window to what is inside the building, but these 2 people do not realise they are seeing something different, despite looking "at" the same thing.
