# The Present
## I Can Live Better than This
I DESERVE TO LIVE BETTER THAN THIS.
I KNOW I AM WORTH BETTER THAN THIS.
I AM OWED BETTER THAN THIS FROM LIFE.

### Live Better than This
As you live better you will create better and you will grow. You are stuck in a dark place, there is work to be done to get out, but you will get out. You know you are capable. You know you are destined for greatness, or at least greater than this. Fight like it, act like it. You don't stay down, you gotta get back up.

Take fucking control of yourself.
Don't have the support network you need to get through. Make it happen. Don't mope around on that forever and forever blame your sad life on that.
Stagnant energy is bad. And all your life is right now is stagnant energy. Transmute all of this stagnant energy and manifest it in the name of the good.
Do something, anything, start the journey up the hill. You need to imagine [[The Future]] in order to achieve [[The Future]].
The you can start taking steps in **The Present** in order to achieve that future.

## Do not Stake Your view of Reality in the Future only
We know that seeking happiness in the future is a fallacy (I really struggled to spell that for some reason). But motivating [[The Ego]] can be done by imagining a better life. Then through imagining that better life we can live a better life and take the necessary steps in order to manifest that way of living into reality.
