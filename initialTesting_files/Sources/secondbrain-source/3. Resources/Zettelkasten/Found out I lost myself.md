# Found out I Lost Myself
While you travelled and lived life, I got lost in my mind.

Living a sheltered and isolated childhood has echoed through my life to live an isolated and sheltered life. Until I can solve the problem.

Retreating into a life of being a semi-hermit, my mind naturally wants to go inward and deep most of the time, during this time of isolation I am able to look deep into myself. See reality for what it is, and not just what I've believed it to be.

I can hold a mirror to myself and see through.
