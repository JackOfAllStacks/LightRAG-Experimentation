# Ai's Role in the Customer Experience Slide and Script
Previous slide is [[Intro Slide and Script]]

## Script
Artificial Intelligence as we now know it exploded into our lives when OpenAI revealed and released ChatGPT, their Large Language Model chat bot in November of 2022. Since then AI has rapidly become a driving force in the transformation of our lives, and notably the customer experience across nearly all industries.

I like to say that AI right now, is as bad as it will ever be. We are moving into a future where AI is only going to continue evolving. It's increasingly becoming an essential tool in enhancing customer experience.
I want you to consider this, by 2025 it is projected that 95% of customer interactions will involve AI in some capacity. Whether this is by interacting with virtual assistants on business websites, automated self-service options or personalised recommendations, we can see that the integration of AI is not only revolutionising how businesses operate, but setting the new standard for customer satisfaction across all sectors.

As we say here at InnovateGPT, "The question is not whether to adopt it but how to leverage it best."
