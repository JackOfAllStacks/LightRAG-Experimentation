# Synchronicity of Old Man Archetype
I just daydreamed thinking about thinking. About going deeper down the rabbit hole. I was met with the idea of entering into the ocean as attributed in the Thomas Zane poem from Alan Wake. Then I got stuck imagining the idea that in the poem when he says "To it's ports I've been", that It was a message from himself from the future. As in somehow, at some point, because Alan Wake is destined to go to the future, he too is also destined to be told this right this second. There was a brief overlap in time where his past consciousness and future consciousness lined up. As if on some kind of time binding circuit as expressed in Leary's 8 circuit theory with the help of teaching by Robert Anton Wilson too.

Anyway, while I was dazed in the day dream I was zoning out into the backyard on to a patch of dirt on the tiles, and was imagining such a situation as my future self talking to my past self. I was seeing on the dirty tiles a kind of old mans face, like an old wise man archetypal figure, yet this old wise man was me, a wise older version of me, communicating to me through time.

The lines in the poem blurred together to somehow come from only perspective.
"For he did not know that beyond the lake he called home
Lies a deeper, darker ocean green
Where waves are both wilder and more serene
To it's ports I've been
To it's ports I've been"

Instead of it being some external person communicating that he is other from the person living at his lake called home, it is instead a future version of this person, communicating to the past self that he has been to the ports. He has been to the ports and he is destined to go to the ports.

Like my old man archetype is telling me that I currently live within the lake, and that beyond the lake I call home, there are the deeper and darker oceans that I have yet to go. Through a kind of paradoxical situation, he is telling me of the deeper darker oceans, which will lead me to discover them and go to "the ports" as is described to me. It's just a story of one person. I've been to the ports, even if I don't know it yet, because I will go to the ports, I've always been to the ports. Retro causality.

This lines up with the way this poem interacts with the character Alan Wake in the game. Thomas Zane is the man in the diving suit that is talking to Alan Wake, and the writer of the poem he is also quoting to Alan Wake. But we later find out that Alan Wake has already written the story he is following, and that Thomas Zane is going into the story and leaving pages for Alan Wake to find in order to better know the story and story beats he has written for himself.

It is this kind of reaching through time on a meta-narrative level, where Alan Wake has already done something he is unaware of. That's without even getting into the idea that Thomas Zane and Alan Wake have a paradoxical situation where it's unclear if Thomas Zane even exists, as he looks the same as Alan Wake in Alan Wake 2. And if Thomas Zane does exist, then he wrote about Alan Wake years prior to Alan Wake, thus did Thomas Zane cause Alan Wake to exist in order for the story between Thomas and the Darkness to have an ending? Or did Alan Wake write Thomas Zane into existence so that Alan Wake could find an ending to his story? The poem has a lot of similar thinking implied through it's contextual use.

Anyway, this would all just be an interesting line of thinking or daydreaming or active imagination, if it wasn't for the synchronicity of looking back to my desk from the dirty tiles outside, and seeing the stack of sticky notes I have written various things from, that were previously stuck to my computer monitors. The very top sticky note from the entire stack that were on my monitors, was the aforementioned Thomas Zane poem. That's what tripped me out.
