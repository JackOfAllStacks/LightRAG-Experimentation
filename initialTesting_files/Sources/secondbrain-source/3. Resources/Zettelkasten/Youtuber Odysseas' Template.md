# {{Title}}

This is the General Template

%%
This is the template Odysseas uses in his video "Obsidian: The King of Learning Tools (FULL GUIDE + SETUP). Using this template Oddyseas doesn't use the "Templater Plugin" and instead uses the basic template structure available through core Obsidian. This is where the uses of the double { comes into play. It is the syntax for the few template structural outputs in Obsidian, and in fact we see all its uses and the extent of it's capability in this template. These are date, time and title. Because of its limited functionality we use the Community Plugin Templater, which with it's more reliance on community creation and upkeep does hinder its reliability for the future, but with its much needed expansion on the templating function of core Obsidian, we see it fit to use it.
