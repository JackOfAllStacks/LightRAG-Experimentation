# I Should Get a Github?
I'm just looking at the the process used by people creating projects and plugins on Obsidian, and it's made me consider making a GitHub of my own.

I need to see if it's all public or just what you publish is, and then from that I need to determine if I'm safe with what's public and private and if I want my stuff on an online front anywhere full stop. Something to consider

Still, the project page seems very intuitive and good for tracking what you are doing to help craft projects efficiently.

Also if I make some public projects, I can use it as a portfolio of some kind for employment and credibility.

Pros are there for sure
Just need to check against the cons
