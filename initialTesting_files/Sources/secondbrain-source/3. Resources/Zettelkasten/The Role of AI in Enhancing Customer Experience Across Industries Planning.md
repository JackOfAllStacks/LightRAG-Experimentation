## Notes from Waz
- Online consumer retail – purchase recommendations?
- Physical retail – Workforce planning to match demand
- Streaming services – viewing recommendations?
- Fast food – Dominos example https://investors.dominos.com.au/news/2019/7/19/the-results-are-in-dominos-new-technology-boosts-pizza-quality
- Healthcare – Use SAVI example https://www.savisurgical.com/
In addition to “transforming customer interactions, driving personalised experiences, and improving satisfaction” I would talk about revenue impact to the customer too.  If it costs money to develop the AI, it has to pay for itself by a significant factor.

Maybe make a slide for a fun introduction.

wanted to keep it tight, id like to go deeper into the benefits and challenges

go deeper instead of just stuff that can be searched on the internet.

Half of little summary of ai. other half is graphic and looks nice

### Fast Food – Dominos Example
The example of AI being integrated into the Domino's pizza making and checking process is a great example of AI enhancing customer experience in the fast food industry.

This article was posted to investors.dominos.com.au on the 19th of July 2019. The technology spoken of in this article and showcased at Domino's is merely a taste of the kind of AI implementation that can be used in our year of 2024, as AI has become better and more widely available since then.
