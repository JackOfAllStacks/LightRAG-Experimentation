# The Correct way of Organising by Projects
Forte references a time where he was helping big executives in San Francisco to organise their life by his method. When asked if he had a project list, the executive wrote down from memory a list that looked like this.

Not having it externalised and written down already and instead recalling from his mind was the first red flag. But then once looking at this list you can see that none of these "projects" are actually projects by the definition we have been using in the [[PARA Method]] and are instead areas of responsibility. These areas of responsibility need to be broken down into more concrete [[PARA Method - Project|Projects (PARA)]] so that they are actually attainable and completable and can be crossed of the list when achieved.

## 1. You Can't Truly Know the Extent of Your Commitments
People can struggle to feel like they have too much on their plate than they are possibly able to deal with. But as long as you are looking at things through the lens of your **"areas of responsibility"** you will never have a truly defined amount of *how much* is actually on that plate. When looking at these areas of responsibility there is no true way of knowing what the task actually entails. Hiring/staffing could be anything from a part-time hire every 6 months to filling 50 positions this quarter. Like the task of eating an elephant, the way to do it is over a period of time, and cutting it down into smaller, more attainable pieces. Break down the *projects* that are actually within the "Hiring" area and we will further be able to see what is needed to be down, and how we can do it.

## 2. You Can't Connect Your Current Efforts to Your Long-term Goals
Looking at the project list above that is really a list of areas of responsibilities, we know that those tasks can't actually get crossed of at any point, because an area as broad as "Research" has no definitive end. By working towards research day in and day out without ever seeing any actual progress being made is a sure fire way of killing motivation. We cannot connect the current efforts to long-term goals this way. We are able to endure the hardships of the moment if we know and can see that there is a purpose for it, or a bigger goal it is helping us get closer to. Break down these areas to the smaller projects, and you can give your brain a little sense of accomplishment every time you can tick off one of those projects as being done. This is how we CAN connect our current efforts to the long-term goals we're building towards.

No matter how wide-ranging your responsibilities are, you can *always* break them down into smaller projects. And you must if you want to know whether you are actually making progress towards your goals.
