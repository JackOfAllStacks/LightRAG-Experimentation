# Para Method
**The PARA Method** is a method of organising every piece of information in your life. Every document, file, note, agenda, outline and bit of research. **The ultimate system for organising your life is one that is *actionable.*** This is what the **PARA method** aims to achieve. Instead of putting more obstacles in between you and you're desired actions, the **PARA method** is designed to remove obstacles and bring what it is you want to do closer to you and make it easier to do.

Human brains, or at least my brain, generally wants to do what it wants to do, when it wants to do it. If a spontaneous idea comes to my mind, a note to take or a project I suddenly want to do, the more obstacles in my way, the more friction there is between having an idea and actualising that idea. We aim for the least friction possible which makes it as easy as possible to do what it is we want to do. That is the goal.

## What Does Para Stand For?

PARA stands for:
- [[PARA Method - Project|Project (PARA)]]
- [[PARA Method - Area|Area (PARA)]]
- [[PARA Method - Resource|Resource (PARA)]]
- [[PARA Method - Archive|Archive (PARA)]]

Now the obvious simplicity of such an organisational system seems to contradict the idea that the entire complexity of your human life can be reduced to and fit within a system such as the **PARA method**, but the logic lies in that simple "contradiction".  If the organisational method you used to organise your life, was one that was big and complex, such is your life, you would end up robbing your time and energy that could be put towards living that life, and instead directing it to maintaining such a system. This system needs to be simple and easy to use, so that you can *free up your attention, instead of using more of it.* Fire and forget.

## The Key Principle
[[The Key Principle of The PARA Method]] is to organise your information primarily by your [[PARA Method - Project|Projects (PARA)]] and goals. You must *"Organise by actionability"*.

## Organising by Projects
[[The Correct Way of Organising by Projects]] is to 1. have it externalised and written down and 2. actually define your [[PARA Method - Project|Projects (PARA)]] correctly in a concrete and achievable way.
