# Creations and the Forms They Take
The spiders art form of choice is the webs they weave. Literally we can see how they use their energy in physical reality to create, but what they choose to create is a tool in order to lay trap and feed on innocent lost lives.
The fact that webs imply some kind of sense for the geometric pattern creation, they mimic circles, and i'm proposing to theorise that the circle is some kind of shape of good, or love. They create in the honour and echo of the good, in order to trap and kill others.
It feels as if they use the power of life in order take. They have the ability to create, which cannot be said for most animals I can think of. Yet they choose to create for the worse.
Just an idea. Like the spirt of a spider is bad. If not, at least this is an obvious projection of unconscious feeling towards them. Valuable either way
