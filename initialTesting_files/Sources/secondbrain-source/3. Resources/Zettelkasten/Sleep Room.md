# Sleep Room
The sleep room in outlast trials is analogy of the sleep room people are in while playing outlast trials, compared to the real world were they not playing a game.
The pieces of consciousness come together to play outlast trials. The meeting spot of these non physical selves. While playing outlast trials, these consciousness are sleeping, but the game is being meta and providing subtle subliminal messages. Even on the nose messages in tone with the game, but perhaps also useful messages for us to hear as individual conscious beings.
"Out there is a dream, you can do anything"
"I was born yesterday. I'll be born tomorrow"
This is in relation to the individual string of consciousness that is birthed through the unconscious every time you awake. The little death that comes as you drift off to sleep. And new you awakens with the memories of you. Indistinguishable from the original, however different nonetheless.
"Crisis is the catalyst of growth"
"You are powerful, you are beautiful, you are deserving of our love"
"Who you are in the trial, is who you are inside"
