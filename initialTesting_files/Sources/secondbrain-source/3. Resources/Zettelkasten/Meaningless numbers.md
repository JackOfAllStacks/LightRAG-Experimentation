# Meaningless Numbers
These are some numbers that have no direct meaning, other than what can be implied from it's obvious meaning. However the mere act of taking notice of a meaningless number gives it some meaning, as it appeared in my mind and experience somehow and through synchornicity, there lays a possibility that further meaning may be taken from its appearance regardless
93, as in 93 till infinity
