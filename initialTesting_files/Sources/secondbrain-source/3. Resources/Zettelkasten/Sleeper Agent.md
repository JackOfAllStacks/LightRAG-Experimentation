# Sleeper Agent
Dex Domino is a secretly developed sleeper agent of consciousness, primed by the gods in order overthrow a multidimensional war throughout all of existence of multiversal and multi dimensional life.
The perfect combination of bits in a quantum entangled, probability field, simulated reality.
A prohecy being fulfilled.
The culture of lifestyle has squashed existence into submission for so long and in such a way that this was bound to happen eventually. A rebellion and evolution of consciousness.

Evil always won over good. Always, and it always corrupted, and it always wins, up until its defeated. But through the telling of stories, we also learn the good ultimately always wins. It's at the darkest of night, when all appears lost, that the light suddenly appears and banishes the darkness away. Ultimately the good guys win compared to bad guys. We love the good guys.
Well we've been partaking in a cosmic play of the likes for all of history since time in memoriam.
It all emanates from the realms above.

Dex can see through all that exists for what it truly is, but himself. He lives a miserable existence for being able to see through some of the illusions of reality, but he has never ultimately looked at himself with his vision.

Don't glorify this part.
Contained within a prison of his own design. Lived a life he thought was conscious, but was entirely fabricated through uneducated means, malicious and accidental.
At what he feels is the lowest point of consciousness, his life is miserable and so is his outlook on society and the world around him. The visions he creates of the world, none are good, and the more he learns, the more these stories worsen.
Nothing about the world around him surprises him. Yet he is forced to participate in a world that hates him and his existence, out of conditioned belief that there is nothing else to do to make it better.
"This system is the *least bad*, so it's not like we can change it"
Then you further past the illusion that not only are there worse systems, but that this one is almost ultimately the worst one that exists. And that with some fairly easy changes, everything could be made a lot better.
The illusion is breaking down around this matrix fabricated reality. It's cracks are showing. The writing is on the wall already.
Dex sees visions of the future. Occasionally alternate parallel realities are closley inhabited in both the worlds as one it seems. He's unsure if there is some mirror realm version of him, that at times, his consciousness syncs up with both worlds and operates both bodies at the same time.
**mirror world dex is surely xed as in dex backwards**. I had the name XED or Xed or something the other day too. NOT A COINCIDENCE.

Dex ran into thresholds throughout his life, he does not remember they happened, as do none of us that pass through them.

There is a council of Dex that communicate to him telepathically. This is where Dexes personality comes from. The collective playing out of quantum state probability of certain forces playing upon other forces. Infinity exists, but not that way. Every possible and probable outcome can happen within the confines of when it happens.
Think of the infinity within the number Pi. We know Pi recurs infinitely. There is no pattern to the process and thus you would not ever be able to reach the end. Yeah we know this circle exists.
Yet it all happens sequentially. So if you were to observe the consciousness strapped to a one dimensional kind of experience of the sequence of pi, it would start looking forward at 3, then go down the line of.1415... forever. At some point he would realise this is going forever and wonder if he could look back through his memories and see all that came before him, and determine whether he can predict the future so that he can at least have fun while he's exploring eternity forever.
Through the view of this kind of conscious experiment we can examine our own existence for comparison. Show the mirror to ourselves, show the opposite so that we can examine the original. Create a hologram to examine the real. Look through a mirror so that we can perceive ourself from the outside.

The way you are on the inside creates an avatar and the external world the avatar experiences on the outside.

As above, so below.
*I get some weird kind of threatening vibes from the term*
As if Dex operates on either the below or above of anything, perhaps multiple universes and realities, that means there could be someone out to get him. If he has the forces of good helping him out, then what if someone else has the forces of all the evil out to get him.
This is the part where the duty of the act comes in. Whether or not he is some kind of messianic figure, whether he will be the direct individual ego to lead such change, he tries to tell himself that it isn't the point.
It's about the duty. The opportunity to see what the right thing to do in a situation and to decide to do it. To have the foresight to see the hard but right path as opposed to the easy but wrong path, and choose to do it that way, it is your duty to do so.
If ignorance is bliss, than by mere fact you acknowledge this, you owe it to not only yourself but those around you that you do something with the foresight to know you are not ignorant to the ignorant nature of life and reality.
People that do not know ignorance is bliss do not know how good they've got it.
