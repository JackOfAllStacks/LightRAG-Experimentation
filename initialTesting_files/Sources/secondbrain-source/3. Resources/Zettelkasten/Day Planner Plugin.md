# Day Planner Plugin
**Day Planner** is a plugin I am using in [[Obsidian]].
This plugin is able to show a calendar view within Obsidian and allows me to click on individual days and weeks in order to create daily and weekly notes.
It also has the functionality of showing me a breakdown of my day on a timeline. I plan to use the **Day Planner Plugin** to help with [[Routine Making]]. **Day Planner** can pull events from my [[Google Calendar]] and I can combine it with the [[Tasks plugin]] to visualise and record my daily activities on the daily timeline.
