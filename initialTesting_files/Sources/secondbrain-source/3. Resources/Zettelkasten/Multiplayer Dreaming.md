# Multiplayer Dreaming
Existence is entirely multiplayer dreaming.
Imagine a pocket universe where there are no humans but you. You are a level of consciousness that is unique within that universe, and thus can attempt to bend the universe to your will. Explore what you want to explore, and do what you want to do. The only other forces that impact upon you are that of your own infliction, and other physical beings such as animals that may want to cause violence.
That level of unhindered freedom and power equates you to a infantile god. With the world of potential at your fingertips. Man could manipulate electricity once we got a sufficient understanding of it. Nothing is any different for the human consciousness. Give infinite monkeys, infinite typewriters and one will write out Shakespeare. This becomes a doubly interesting statement when you consider the fact that were are infinite monkeys with infinite typewriters, and once of us already has written Shakespeare.

Now take this analogy back to our reality. If your consciousness is nothing different than in this reality than the other, than why have we not got the freedom of power that the individual human consciousness in a pocket reality has.
It's the fact that there are other human consciousnesses. And non-human consciousness acting upon the human consciousnesses too.
The submission and domination circuit of every human brain. Some imprint domination, others submission.
The domination imprinted brains realise the power they have, and realise that through the act of domination, there is nothing they cannot achieve.

This whole process depends on the submitted consciousness to not become aware of the true nature of their own consciousness. Because they are in a submitted imprint, they are unable to experience consciousness through the lens of domination.

"The proletariat cannot become conscious until they rebel, and they cannot rebel until they become conscious"

Existence since time immemorial has been a battle of the dominated vs the submitted. Once there was one man, then a second. The first man new from his own nature how powerful he is, if the second person wished only to take control he knew he could. So person one had to strike first, before being dominated by the other.
Through this domination, he could then continue the chain of domination, until someone that is better at the domination takes him down.
This is a story that devolves into a story of victories of the most powerful dominator through time.
Occasionally there is peace, but peace is only ever fleeting, and almost exclusively due the fact that opposing dominators view no value in dominating the other. Either that or they are no match, so they try not to prod the bear until they can take them on. Scheming from the background.

Notice how we started with domination vs submission, and now we've reached a part where it's domination vs domination.
It's the [[Hegelian Dialectics]] in play. 1 opposing another, until a victor comes out on top.
Because we know the submitted are no match for the dominator, we know the submitted are also going to be no match of the rival dominator. Or successor of the 2 dominators.

Because the submitted do not know they are submitted, they cannot fight against their dominators. Like in A Bugs Life, the pests have the speech "Do not let them know that they outnumber us 1000 to 1." Their power is an illusion. An illusion that the people that have fallen for it, cannot even become aware that they live an illusion.

If the oppressed became aware of their true oppressors, they could fight back and see through the illusion. But as we see enough through modern times, the true oppressors engage in amazing subterfuge and misdirection tactics. Divide and conquer, which has been their biggest play in the book of domination. It has had all until this point in time to practice and perfect it.
But the illusion is slowly breaking down. More and more people are waking up to see what's really happening.
