# Zettelkasten Method
The Zettelkasten method is an organisational system used to create a web of knowledge of your notes. The main way this works is by not organising your notes and information in anyway to begin with, and instead let your notes organically create the links and organisation for itself as it grows. You have yourself one Zettelkasten folder in which ALL of your notes go, and eventually as you build up this collection of notes, they can organically grow links and connections to one another by themselves, without you needing to do much at all.

## Principles
There are a few principles of the Zettelkasten method. They are:
- **Principle of Atomicity**: put things that belong together into a single note, give it an ID, but then limit the content of that note to a single topic.
- **Principle of Connectivity**: This is about connecting notes to one another, through methods such as links and note sequences.

Zettelkasten is based around having 3 areas.
1. **Fleeting notes**. Notes that are made up on the spot with the intent to be fully fleshed out by another note at some point
2. **Literature notes**. These notes are used for when you're taking notes of something that is not an original creation by you. So it could be notes from a book, a YouTube video or an article for example.
3. **Permanent notes**. These are more refined combinations of the fleeting and literature notes. Where you may bring ideas from fleeting notes and flesh them out more, or use the a topic from a literature note as inspiration for another note of your own creation.

# Note
I feel like I've already gotten the grasp of the way the Zettelkasten method is used through multiple YouTube videos I've watched since learning about and researching [[Obsidian]]. So this note is going to be left a bit bare bones as I don't feel like wasting too much time and energy on it.
