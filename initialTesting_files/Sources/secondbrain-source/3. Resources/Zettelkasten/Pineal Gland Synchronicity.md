# Pineal Gland Synchronicity
I just had a synchronicity while rubbing my forehead, feeling like I'm having a headache from using my brain again after not using it for a long time. Which synchronises with the thought of it being my pineal gland that is being used, as I feel like I'm literally using this muscle of my body I've never used before, my third eye. While imagining this i saw the Egyptian symbol of the pineal gland depicting both the actual brain diagram of the pineal gland, but also an eye symbol.

I need to learn to use my brain again while I learn to use my ego again, while learning to use my third eye again.
