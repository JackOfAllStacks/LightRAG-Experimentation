# Meaning where there is None
The human mind has a profound ability to find meaning where there is none. This faculty of the mind manifests itself in various ways.
One way is that of the "schizophrenic" (I dislike using this word for "reasons" however there is an obvious connotation and meaning represented in the word that makes its use necessary) ability to connect dots and find connections between events and subjects that to many other sane people makes no sense whatsoever. However, through the lived experience of the the "schizophrenic", he is able to think up connections between things and convince himself that this is true.
