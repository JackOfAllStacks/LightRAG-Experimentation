# Dataview Plugin
The **Dataview Plugin** is a very strong community plugin for [[Obsidian]] that allows you to use the [[Obsidian]] vault as a database. You can query for all kinds of results throughout the vault. I will be learning this plugin the best I can so I can use it a lot. I keep finding moments I wish I knew how to formulate the queries better because I know I could use it for this.
