# Rebuilding Foundations
I feel as though I am going back through myself. Identifying myself. Examining myself and my past. Creation through deconstruction. I must first re-assemble my foundations the way I need them to be, in order to continue to craft a life I want.

That's exactly what I'm in the process of. I'm analysing my life around me, and getting ready to sort it the way I want. I'm trying to consciously take control of my actions and my life.

I'm learning to control my energy. Reigning it all, in order to be the one that rides the chariot.
Taking control of all the horses, taking control of my will power. Living my life through my conscious intent.

I must shed the unconscious life.
