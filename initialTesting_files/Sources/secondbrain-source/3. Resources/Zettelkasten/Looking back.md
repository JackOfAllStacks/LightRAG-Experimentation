# Looking back
We need to start examining the past. Our past. Only through examining our story as told through time, can we face what remains in our unconscious from then. Once we catch up to the present day, we can take control and ride the wave of being in the present moment, living through our divine centred decision making space.

I think it will be good to start taking keeping track of the areas in time periods.
1. [[The Past]]
2. [[The Present]]
3. [[The Future]]

Examination of life from the past can cause confrontation with trauma's or truths about oneself that is actively pushed to the unconscious. Shining a light into the unconscious and onto the problems in our life can cause better understanding of ourselves and to become conscious of our own unconscious behaviour.
This combines naturally with examination of the present life also. Looking to the past can slowly allow you to acknowledge and discern moments of unconscious behaviour in the present moment. Through continued conscious control over unconscious feelings we can train our muscle of conscious behaviour, to increasingly live a more conscious and fulfilled life.
By contemplating the life of the future you desire you can state your own personal goals for your life to strive for. By the mere act of being honest with yourself and stating what your goals actually are, you can immediately start deciding all future decisions on whether it furthers your distance towards this goal being achieved.

Through the combination of all three areas, the hopes are we can improve ourself.
