### Ai as a Bubble?
I'm sceptical to this job and company as it seems like it could be part of the AI bubble that has been expanding. Everywhere AI seems to be the buzzword running the show.

ask for some examples that they have delivered to customers.
follow up with "what was the customers main goal of the project. looking to reduce headcount, increase efficiency."

asking casually might be better

what are the next steps of the interviewing processes?

### Following Openai and Strawberry
I've been following along OpenAI's developments closely as they seem to be the leading forefront of the industry at the moment. They just released their new model called o1 or Strawberry which has the ability to think and reason. I've been following the development of this model in the online space and have actually been participating in an open source model that aims to try and mimic what we believe the strawberry model is doing. The open source project is called Raspberry and is being worked on by people on Github, with me being a contributor and follower of the space.
