# Myth Writing part 1
First person narration type of Dexter Domino

Touch being a one dimensional experience of reality. Imagine a blind consciousness that first develops feeling. Groping the dark of existence, trying to discover what is out there, but there is no out there and in there. It's all the same. It's all you.
There is only one thing in existence. One entity that is feeling around in the dark to try and discover what it is..
Like the idea that a universe exists, but could not examine itself until it created some kind of holographic universe. It creates an opposite and slowly explores itself until it knows what it is. It is a real universe examining the shadow of itself. The duality of existence stems from this feeling.
But at some point, the one will realise that there is no other, and that all is actually one. The marrying of half's, the acceptance of the shadow self. The unity of 2 halves realising they can be whole, if only the realised they were each others other half to complete them.
Why choose division when there can be perfect harmony.
It's all the cosmic play experienced by the universe.
The last lines of touch by Daft punk express this.

## Touch, Sweet Touch. You've Almost Convinced Me I'm Real
*This is the internal monologue of the dreaming universe.* The dream of the universe can be expressed through the hologram universe. God goes to sleep and dreams a dream to forget that he is god. Through this god can be so invested in a story, that when he wakes up he remembers none of it was real, but he desires to know more and more about himself. To go deeper into the unconscious part of himself. Partaking in the cosmic drama of exploration. Touch is exactly one dimensional form of interaction consciousness has evolved into. As ThirdEyeTyrone states and has so eloquently stated "It appears as though reality is consciousness mutating through space and time." Consciousness first evolves as single cell organisms, life evolves and continues its exploration through dimensional space until it reaches humanity, where a new brain/ pattern/ configuration of stuff allowed itself to explore realties dimensions so efficiently that it became the leading consciousness of a planet. The third eye or imaginal realm is the next step in our evolution. Everything physical comes as some form of expression of the higher imaginal realms.

It's gods all the way up or down. Inception. Layers of dreaming dreams of quantum possible realties playing out all at the same "*Time*". Time doesn't exist as we experience it, but there is only ever the eternal now or present. But infinite monkeys, infinite typewriters all individual the same story. A story of infinity. Of infinite time continuing on forwards and back, infinite chances of anything happening. Think of the infinite monkeys, a monkey could write over the span of a billion years, by pure chance and randomness and chaos, a story that one also writes in it's entirety with little change. Infinite possibility, parallel realities
