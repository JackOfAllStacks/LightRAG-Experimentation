# Symbol Language of Dex
spider = sinister, spiders in nature craft webs in the form of a circle and use a creation in the name of the infinity to loiter and kill for it's existence.
This might just be projection onto spider, and the seeing of spider can also be seen as a spiritual omen, that being you need more patience and perseverance. That sounds more likely to me and the projection onto spider is just a very good insight into myself.
