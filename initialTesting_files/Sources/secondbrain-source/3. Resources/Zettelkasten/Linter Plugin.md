# Linter Plugin
**The Linter plugin** is a community plugin for [[Obsidian]] that allows me to "Lint" pre-existing notes within my [[Obsidian]] Vault. The process of "linting" a file or files will arrange and edit files in order to make the file adhere to certain rules that are set in the plugins settings.

I currently have played with the YAML settings of the plugin in order to standardise the order and arrangement of the YAML of all existing and future notes of this vault.
There are many other ways to use the plugin too and I will probably end up using it more in depth later on.
