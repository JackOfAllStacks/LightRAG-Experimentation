# Kojima Synchronicity
I noticed i can kick from conscious actions to unconscious actions and that sometimes he can feel like travelling to another universe. I just had a brief one while trying to describe this. The Greek terms that end in os, I wrote down mythos while writing the [[Hiddeo Kojima]] note that the os from mythos, eros, logos etc. Also can feel or sound like the term for some physical universe. Something about that feels like a more accurate way to describe where those concepts come from.

The universe of concepts is excitedly bigger than the universe of physical matter.

This isn't even [[Jack Di Iorio]] talking anymore. This is [[Jack Di Iorio]] acting as a vessel for the drama of the universe to play through. He can participate with the universe, live within his set course, and experience ease through this process.
Flowing like the Tao. If you go with the flow, it is neither good nor bad, it just is. We think we understand what that means when we read it, or think it, or conceptualise it, but we don't. Words are more than just words, they all emanate from somewhere else. The realm or symbols. All the symbols in the realm of symbols emanate from somewhere else too.
This is making me think of the [[Kaballistic Tree of Life]] and how much i need to learn that lesson. The secrets hidden behind that understanding must be learnt and integrated.

Everything is energy that can flow through the universe. Like that quote from [[Shogun]] about; learning to see the way the wind blows, and blow with it. Not harnessing any power, forcing will over the wind. You cannot force any physical will over the wind, lest you try and instead create an ego to learn to cope that you are getting no where.

The only way a perspective could exist in that state would be through the smallest of smalls / biggest of bigs *egos* that is convincing it self that he is grabbing the wind somehow and is actually wining that fight. Creating a state of delusion that while entranced in, cannot be convinced otherwise. Some kind of mass spell applied to humanity.

*notice the use of Ego-s creating a word egos? Egos can also be interpreted to sound like what we expect it to sound like and if can make sense regardless. It sounds like a universe with the os at the end, like a greek word because of the os at the end, or like it is simply as Ego-s meaning plural Ego.  Any of these interpretations can make sense. Also notice the paradox of small size egos meaning in comparison the egos size needed to delude itself that its physical world / physical power being exerted over the wind being small, yet the way we think about it in a more human sense is that you must need a super inflated / big ego to believe such a thing. Depending on the perspective the Ego/s is big or small, yet it means the same. Paradox.*

Anyway the synchronicity is
