# For Myself

For Myself
All that it is that I am trying to do is for myself.
I do not need to prove anything to anyone else.
If all I am doing is trying to convince myself as to whether I am insane or not,
```
*the above was written under a different train of thought, but ran out at the , and upon inspection seemed like a strange unconscious message to myself that needs to be questioned*
	How has the atomisation of people affected me? Is this my trauma, loneliness and the atomisation of my life? If so, how does what I said above continue that belief? "All that it is that I am trying to do is for myself". Does this sound like you are living the life you should be living? Is that the ethics of your life?
	"I do not need to prove anything to anyone else". Ok this can be interpreted as empowerment, however in the context of what I was typing, it more meant that "as long as I can prove something to myself, that's all that matters", which can be a problematic belief. However this thought may hold true in the sense of the original thought and matter, that as long as I believe, I can do anything. I do not need to adhere to any defined sense of thinking as society or someone else deems necessary.
	The last part is obviously problematic for shadow affairs. A constant desire to prove to yourself that you are not insane, is not very sane. Sane people do not question or live their life questioning whether what they experience is normal and sane or insane. Yet the further point I make I continue to believe is correct. 
	So which one is it??? Consciousness talking, or unconsciousness communicating something? Both? Maybe both? How could it be both?
	[[The Truth Lays In Questioning]]
Perhaps the question of sanity stems from me driving myself mad, knowing the truth, knowing that I'm not insane, and yet continuoisly asking myself. By the stretch of the real definition of insanity, I am insane. I am doing the same thing over and over again.
Where else am I doing this. That I know that nothing is holding me back but myself and my own inability to follow through and back myself. If I cure that, I cure it all, and I know that. I know that if my beliefs were helping me to achieve what I wanted, then I would not be questioning my sanity because it would all be working, with no reason to question sanity.
It's a circle. It's a cycle I must close.
The reason I am where I am right now is money, the only thing holding me back from money is a job, the only thing holding me back from a job is my lack or looking. At least take that step because right now the only obstacle is myself. 

Well now the question of whether that text was originally a conscious statement or an unconscious statement doesn't matter, maybe the question is whether it was in such a way that I needed to ask myself further questions about it, and that that was the true point of the statement? Who's to say. Was Neo going to knock that vase over if the Oracle didn't say anything?

*continuation of original thought*
the act of proving myself to myself, for all intents and purposes proves the proof. If I can live a life in accordance to everyone else while I too deem myself sane, then I am sane, despite whatever it is I am experiencing and how foreign it may be to someone else.

There is no need for any external judgment to undermine your say.
