# Synchronising with the Universe
The whole universe breathes together right? It all vibrates together, that is what a synchronicity is. A time when you dip into synchronistic experience with the universe.

[This reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/starseeds/comments/1ez018o/has_anyone_ever_ascended_to_their_star_self_and/) talks about being in a real life court while also experiencing the galactic court. When one matrix takes notice, the whole matrix takes notice.
As above, so below. Experiencing our below court, while simultaneously experience something akin to galactic court. Being in 2 states at once.

When the governing forces of physical reality start intruding upon my physical life, that echoes all throughout my being and affects me everywhere.

Follow the rules of the matrix, do not get caught here, and I will not get caught there either.

However bother realms probably influence one another. If out there tries to get me, they may be able to influence the physical realm in order to get me here and there.

It all ripples off one another, like rocks being thrown into a lake. The ripples bounce off one another and affect the entire ocean.

Intention and reality all bouncing off one another to develop some kind of larger consensus reality.
