# Paradox
Paradox is a character in [[Deadlock]].

Paradox is a member of an anymous organisation of the same name.

The members of [[Paradox the Organisation]] all wear masks and don the assumed persona of Paradox the Character.

Paradox the Character can be anyone and everyone. It is more than just an individual. It is not a person, but many. It is more of a single unified vision tied behind a person.

There is no organisation to believe in, but one singular person, and to believe in that vision anyone can participate in that vision.

A belief of a greater purpose more than oneself, or others. Greater than anything, the members of [[Paradox the Organisation]] believe in [[Paradox]].

Whatever vision the character of Paradox emanates from the believers can participate in the Paradox Story.

By ceasing to be an individual, the members become more than just an individual.

***interesting note. This aligns with my thoughts on the concept of the ego being the only thing holding us back.
The ego was created as a good tool to participate in the story of life, but now the only thing that stops you from experiencing the true reality, is that ego.
Like Kyle has explained through gnosis, the ego is trapped up in all these containers, and that any moment can be used to question where that consciousness came from, and untrap it.***

I feel like my consciousness is trapped in my relationship to technology. As i also believe the outside world to be also. "As above, so below".
Just had the [[Pineal Gland Synchronicity]].
