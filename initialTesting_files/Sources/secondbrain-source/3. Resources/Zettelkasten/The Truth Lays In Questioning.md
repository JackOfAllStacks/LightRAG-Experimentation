# The Truth Lays in Questioning
I propose that one can acquire the truth through continued exploration of a topic.
This came to my mind as I was writing this note [[For Myself]]. Questioning my own beliefs, i found myself asking further questions to. Upon answering those questions the best I could or sufficiently wanted to, I noticed I could ask another "layer" of questions in order to dig deeper into the mystery, and potentially uncover the truth, my truth.
Whether this is accurate or not, I linked the idea to the concept of the liar detecting machines (Polygraphs), and conceptualised, how with sufficient understanding of this concept, anyone could consciously and meticulously dig into other peoples lies or truths. This made me think of polygraph tests, and how I don't quite believe they work as we think, that the truth lies in heart rate asked to specific questions, but more so, the responses to specific questions. The heart rate is merely a nice indication of whether you're striking at gold or not. Whether you're on the right track or not.
It would make sense for the wider population to think that somehow the former is right, despite our lack of knowledge as to how, than to know how such a method works.
Analogous to the existence of a "truth serum", and the difference between knowing a truth serum exists, and the inventor and users of truth serum know how it works.
