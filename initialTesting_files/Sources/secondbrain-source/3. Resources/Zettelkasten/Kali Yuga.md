# Kali Yuga
Apparently we are living within the Kali Yuga, which is a state of time where it appears as though evil has one, but it's gonna be ok.
If there is to be a prophet arise in the end times, it may be as a complete spiritual awakening. Everyone working together.
If everyone's the prophet then no ones the prophet. If anyone can be the prophet or the messiah, then we should all try to be better just in case we found out it's us, or that the person we cross paths with at the local caf√© is the future messiah. If it could be anyone around you, you will treat everyone as though they are the messiah. If you think it could be you you will want to behave better and look after yourself better.
