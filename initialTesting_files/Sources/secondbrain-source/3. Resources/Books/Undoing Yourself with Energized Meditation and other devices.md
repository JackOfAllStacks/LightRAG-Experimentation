# Undoing Yourself with Energized Meditation and other Devices

## Introduction by Robert Anton Wilson
The "free will" delusion is a delusion that causes complete and utter disconnection on the participation of reality. It makes sure that people will be incapable of understanding anything happening around them.
*People may as well be deaf, dumb and blind and wearing signs warning the world "ULTIMATE DESTINATION: THE MAD HOUSE"*
Modern biology and psychology have proven facts that 99 percent of the human race is operating from a level of participation with the universe that is effectively a robot/zombie like state. Based completely in unconscious programming of the psyche. Worse even, is that we are in this state 99.9999 % of the time.
We must not fool ourselves into thinking that we are the exception. We are talking about precisely ourselves. *"We are all bozos on this bus"* As the Fireside Theatre used to say.
The best thing we can say about this lived experience is that occasionally, some of us may have brief moments of lucidity. The downside of this is that it can be said of any schizophrenic patient.
We are all brain damaged.
As shown through analysis of the myth propagated from elsewhere around the world, notably the orient, the idea of free will is some kind of self-hypnosis that is perpetuated as a symptom stemming from Humanity's delusion that we are somehow separate from the natural world. That we have a different level of consciousness, that we think and nothing else does. It's all this egotistical nature that we are better than everything else.
Every living creature seems to have just about as much free will as anything else. We have as much as a flower, shrub, rock or virus. It is this narcisstisic self-hypnosis that is the root of all problems.
As that one quote goes "All of man's problems stem from his inabiity to sit alone in a room with his thoughts".
In the orient this belief that we are all born robots with unconscious programming is understood, yet they believe we are born this way, and die this way. The practice of undoing oneself is of little importance since it cannot be changed, so why bother. Even more so the idea of undoing one's unconscious programing is even less believed to hold any merit in the west since we cannot even acknowledge said fact that we are programmed. There is no reason to work, and work HARD, because we have already achieved this state of free will, we already don't have any programming, so why bother unprogramming?
It's this example of the act of "knowing" something unknown proves to be the root problem.
An egotistical statement that says "I'm perfect" can only be made by someone with such a self-deluded vision of themselves that they do not know themselves. Nobody is perfcet, and even more important, we cannot improve our faults until we acknowledge that they exist.
A cracked panel of glass cannot start to repair its perpetuation of a crack, until it first acknowledges there is a crack in the first place, then it can slowly work on that crack.
We cannot change our patterns, until we acknowledge the patterns we already live by. Change unconscious patterns consciously, and you can begin to live a life of conscious patterns.
As the tao refer to as the action of non-action.

The Sufic and Hermetic traditions are almost Oriental in forgiving robots for being robots. A Sufi poet once said
```ad-quote
*The fool neither forgives nor forgets;
The half-enlightened forgive and forget;
The Sufi forgives but does not forget.*
```
The Sufi's know that we live in a world full of unconsious robots, and do not blame the robots for their programming, yet they will not forget the fact that we are living in a world of unconsious robots.

The best way to see change, and to achieve whatever it is you want to in your heart, is to want it so bad that you do not even think about how bad you want it, you merely live it. Make yourself obsessed with your mission and goal. This is all to say that the only way to bring about the change you want is to
**DO IT EVERY BLOODY DAY
WARNING
THREATS TO THE PRIMATE EGO ARE INCOMING**
"The reason that mystics and certain other psychologists are always *attacking* the ego is that the ego is the one mechanical circuit that suffers chronically from the illusion that it is non-mechanical and *free*"

## Introduction by Israel Regardie
Some techniques of meditation referenced by Regardie at the start of his section is; Transcindental Mediation (TM), and a so called chaotic meditation of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. The latter is the one that comes nearest to the "vital and powerful" method described by the author Chistopher s. Hyatt in this book.
