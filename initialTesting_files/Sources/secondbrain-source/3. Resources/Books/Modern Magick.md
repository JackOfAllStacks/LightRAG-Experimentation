# Modern Magick,Twelve Lessons in the High Magicakal Arts

started reading 25/08/2024

# The Outer order
## Lesson 1
**No one can give you magickal powers. You have to earn them. There is only one way to do this: Practice! Practice! Practice!**
Magick is an experimental science, and so starting today and with the start of this course of learning, I must record and take note of my journey.
Must keep record of practices, experiences, thoughts and dreams.
This will be done in 2 separate records.

### The Dream Diary
Starting right now, I must keep track of my dreams. Dreaming can be a combination of 4 occurrences.
1. *Astral Work* When doing astral work lessons can be learned about your spiritual, psychical and magickal development. This is all done on the Astral Plane
2. *Psychological Messages* This is where communication between the unconscious and the conscious takes place. When the unconscious needs to talk to the conscious but it refuses to listen, the message can be sent through dreams and symbolic language.
3. *Play* Not everything is of deep meaning and importance. Sometimes the brain may just be at rest and wander aimlessly. Conjuring up beautiful or bizarre dreams to enjoy
4. *A combination of the above*

First ritual to incorporate is that of recording every day's dreams. Writing what I can remember of my dream, first thing when I wake up, writing it into my pocket notebook. Then later, upgrading and moving the dream entry into my digital dream journal here on obsidian.
Will need to play with the idea of going straight into obsidian with the entry, determine whether paper or digital matters and what differences occur.
If you cannot remember anything, "I did not choose to remember my dreams."
It is promised that within a month of consistent work, it will be hard to keep dreams to less than a page. We will see.

It will probably take a while to learn to interpret dreams and the language used, even whether to determine which type of the 4 dreams it is. Just record the dreams, we can analyse and come back to them later.
Start by looking for recurring dreams or recurring themes.

Changes in dreams can reflect changes in life or vice versa.

### The Ritual or Magickal Diary
Keeping track of conditions and emotions when doing rituals can lead to better understanding of what works and why. You can see what provides you greatest success. And by keeping track of these factors, you can forge your own magickal text which is only good for you.

Phase of the moon is something to be tracked. Full, waning or waxing.
Weather conditions. Rainy, cloudy, hot, muggy, warm, cold etc.
Emotions. Happy, sad, depressed etc.
Performance. Was the ritual done well, fair, poorly etc.
Results. How do you feel?  What did you experience? etc. You may want to add later additions to this section, how the results of the ritual are coming to be. Date any additions.

**Regularity is important**. You cannot "bank" up rituals by performing 7 one day, and not doing any for the rest of the week. Do them at least once a day. Doing them more often than once a day works too however. Just remember to record the rituals or groups of rituals in their own entries.

3 tips to remember dreams
1. As you fall asleep, repeat silently to yourself "I will remember my important dreams when I awake"
2. If you awake from a dream but want to go back to sleep, scrunch up a ball of paper or tissue and throw it in the middle of the floor. As you do, tell yourself that it will remind you of the dream you had. Then when you wake up in the morning, the unusual occurrence will trigger a memory of the dream
3. When you wake up, first priority is to record something from the dream. Transfer it to the drea journal and then expand on it as you remember more.
4. Record something daily. Make it a habit by doing it for at least 3 weeks.

### Tarot
A tarot deck is complementary to the working of this book, however the Thoth Crowley deck I have is deemed too symbolically complex to be good for beginning.
I should get;
- The Golden Dawn Tarot, The Golden Dawn Magical Tarot by Chic and Sandra Tabatha Cicero is the best option it seems
- The B.O.T.A Tarot. The Builders of the Adytum by Paul Foster Case.
- The Hermetic Tarot by Godfrey Dawson

### The Relaxation Ritual
Steps
1. Sit or lie down somewhere you will not be disturbed for at least 5 mins. Disconnect from the online and get comfortable. If you are sitting, your back should be up straight. Whether sitting or lying down, do not cross any appendages. If sitting, rest your hands, palms down, in your lap. Now close your eyes.
2. Visualise a golden ball of beautiful warm light surrounding your feet. Whether you can "see" the ball or not when you visualise it, do not worry, just know that it is there, and that if your powers of visualisation were different, you would certainly be able to see it. The ball of golden warm light always brings peace and total relaxation. Wherever the ball goes, tension flows away. Let it go, and as it goes, feel your feet filled with the warm golden glow of peace and total relaxation.
3. Next allow the ball to rise up your legs and up your torso. Then allow it to go down your arms to your fingers, and finally up your neck and into your head until you are completely covered with the warm golden glow of total peace and relaxation and all tension is gone. Allow it to move slowly. Take your time. Let go.
4. Using your mind, spend a few moments exploring your body and any sensations you may be feeling. If you notice any tension, send the ball to it and notice the tension will vanish. With each breath, allow yourself to become more and more relaxed.
5. Stay in this state of deep relaxation for a few moments. You can reach this state whenever you like, by simply doing the relaxation ritual again. Use it before bed if you are struggling to sleep.
6. When the time is ready and you wish to come out of this state, take three deep breaths  and feel the fresh life and energy coming into your body with each breath. Let the energy flow completely through you, from the ends of your hair to the tips of your toes and fingers. Become aware of the world around you, and breath in life.
7. When you have returned to regular awareness, record the experience in the ritual diary

### What is Magick
According to Aleister Crowley, magick is "the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with the Will." Crowley being a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Another member was Dion Fortune. Her definition was the same as Crowley's, except that she consider the "change" to be a change in consciousness. (To be of note is that Fortune as a lay psychologist, someone who practiced psychology without being a medical doctor.)

Using the example of doing a magickal ritual to get fifty dollars, we can examine what it is your "Will" is affecting. Say you go for a walk and routinely you would turn right, however this day something urges you to turn left, upon doing so you end up running into a friend that gives you fifty dollars back that you leant him several months ago.
According to Crowley, it would be  your magickal ritual that caused a change in the physical world that resulted in you turning an unusual direction. A smell, telepathic message from the friend, a higher entity telling you to "turn left!". However by Dions definition, it would be some change in your consciousness that gave you the information to change direction, as a result of your ritual.

Regardless of this, three things are obvious.
1. No matter which definition is used, the result is the same
2. The result functions as if there had been a change in the physical world, regardless as to whether the change was truly in the physical world or in your consciousness
3. Magick works

Crowley (Pronounced as a rhyme to holy) says that "every intentional act is a Magickal act." Following this reasoning, anything as simple as willing to open a door can be seen as a magickal act. This belief is fair enough, but it is not an accurate definition we want to use in regards to this book.

Our definition of Magick will be;
**Magick** is the science and art of causing change (in consciousness) to occur in conformity with will, using means not currently understood by traditional Western science.

The occultism of the past becomes the science of the future.
Arthur C. Clarke, the Sci-Fi writer and author of 2001: A Space Odyssey, said "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magick."

Our definition is good, but doesn't yet reference the our goal of using magick or our goal. There are different types of magick that are used in order for different purposes.

### White Magick
In eastern cultures, white magick is known as yoga. When most people reference yoga they usually are referencing Hatha Yoga (Pronounced "hot-ha"). This type of yoga involves involves stretching of the body in preparation of true yoga.
The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit word *yug* which means yoke or union. The true "union" of true yoga is when you unite yourself to, your higher self or with God.
White Magick, which is sometimes called mysticism, is the yoga of the West.
It's goal has a variety of names; cosmic consciousness, enlightenment. the Knowledge and Conversation of your Holy Guardian Angel, realisation of self, and more.
The expression of the Golden Dawn is;
White Magick is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will, using means not currently understood by traditional Western science, for the purpose of obtaining the Knowledge and Conversation of your Holy Guardian Angel.

### Black Magick
Black Magick is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will, using means not currently understood by traditional Western science, for the purpose of causing either physical or non-physical harm to yourself or others, and is done either consciously or un-consciously.

This book explores and discussed the topic of Black Magick only by how to avoid accidentally becoming a black magick practitioner.

### Grey Magick
Grey magick is a mixture of using White and Black magick. It can become either white or black (or remain grey).
Grey Magick is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will, using means not currently understood by traditional Western science, for the purpose of causing either physical or non-physical good to yourself or others, and is done either consciously or un-consciously.

In an example in which you perform a ritual in order to help a friend regain their health, you are using magick in order to bring good to another person. So it is Grey Magick. But because you are doing good for another person, you are bringing yourself closer to Divinity, closer to Knowledge and Conversation with your Holy Guardian Angel, and so it is White Magick also.

It is noted that there is nothing wrong with using Magick to get ahead in the physical realm. In fact it is encouraged. Use Magick to improve your life, get money, friends, love and fame. Use Magick to reach your goals.

Another example. If you use magick in order to get 1000 dollars, but then your uncle crashes his car and dies and leaves you 1000 dollars in his will. This is a result of your magick, and because you inadvertently (or directly) killed your uncle, this was an act of Black Magick.
You obtained your goal, but at what cost?
There is always a price to pay. "As you sow, so shall you reap".

If you cause evil or been a source of spiritual darkness, it will surely return to you.
Wiccan Traditions believe that whatever you do, will be returned to you threefold.
Practicing Black Magick will always cause a price to be paid, and often the price will be heavier than expected.

Someone that used to be an old Black Magic practitioner and Satanist always knew when a ritual had come to fruition, as something unfortunate would happen to her.
As is called in the East, this is Karma. The Kabalist's have Titkune (pronounced "tee-koon"). Such as the invisible law of gravity, so too is there this one. Put out good and you will receive good. Put out evil, even unintentionally, and evil is what you will get. Such is the law.

Before performing any Grey Magick, one should first do a divination to determine the effect and outcome of your magick. This is where importance of learning the Tarot or another divinatory system is important.

Teachings of the Tarot are based upon the occultists and Kabalists E. E. Waite and S. L. Macgregor Mathers.

Time to learn a second daily ritual.

### The Tarot Contemplation Ritual
1. Remove the twenty-two cards of the Major Arcana. Take from the twenty-two cards (numbered 0-21) the cards numbered 6, 7, 10, 13, 15, and 18*. These are not going to be used at this time so put them with the rest of the deck and keep the remaining Major Arcana while you perform the relaxation ritual.
2. Immediately after completing the Relaxation Ritual, take the sixteen cards that remain of the Major Arcana and shuffle them in any manner you desire, until you get a feeling it is time to stop. Note that the feeling may be very subtle. If you don't get such a feeling, stop mixing after a minute..
3. Select any one card and look at the picture on it for no more than three minutes.
4. Take three deep breaths and the Tarot contemplation ritual is complete.
5. Record the card name and number in your magickal diary, also record any feelings, sensations, or ideas you received while contemplating the card.

## True Meanings of the Tarot?
There is no "True" meaning of the Tarot. Different authors give different meaning to different cards depending on their interpretations of the symbolism on the cards.
Some people look at a card and make up the meaning on the spot upon looking at it. Others, as Donaled Michael Kraig was taught, may follow a system based on a type of numerology. There are other systems based on meanings given by Tarot interpreters or "other authorities"
No matter which system you use however, as long as the system is internally consistent, it can be used to provide real results.
The cards pulled with the meanings you have for them result in "meaningful coincidences", as the psychologist Carl Jung, calls a Synchronicity.
As long as the system used is internally consistent, it will end up providing viable results

## Physical Items Needed for the Lbrp
There are multiple physical items needed for performing the LBRP.
The first and foremost is the [[Magickal Altar]].
The LBRP should have a designated space to be at undisturbed for at least 10 mins when performing the ritual.
