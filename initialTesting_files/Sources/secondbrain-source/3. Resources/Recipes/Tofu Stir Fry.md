# Tofu Stir Fry
***Four Servings***

## Ingredients
- 400g firm tofu, cubed
- 1 capsicum
- 1 broccoli
- 250g sugar snap peas
- 2 carrots
- 2 cup brown rice (4 cups cooked)
- 3 tbsp Soy sauce
- 2 cloves of minced garlic
- 1 tbsp minced ginger
- 1 tsp sesame oil

### Instructions:
1. Press tofu to remove excess water, then cut into cubes.
2. In a large pan or wok, heat a bit of oil over medium-high heat.
3. Add tofu and cook until golden brown on all sides. Remove and set aside.
4. In the same pan, add mixed vegetables and stir-fry until tender-crisp.
5. Return tofu to the pan.
6. In a small bowl, mix soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil.
7. Pour sauce over tofu and vegetables, and toss to coat.
8. Serve over cooked brown rice.
9. Store leftovers in individual meal containers in the fridge.

*Idea from Nonna: add fried onions and bacon*
