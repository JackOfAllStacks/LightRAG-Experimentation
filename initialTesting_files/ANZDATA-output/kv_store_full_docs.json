    "content": "News Release\nFor release: 15 October 2019\nUpdate on APRA’s consultation on the capital treatment for investments in subsidiaries (Level 1)\nANZ today provided an update on the potential implications of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority’s (APRA) proposed changes to the capital treatment by Australian ADIs of their investments in banking and insurance subsidiaries.\nThe consultation is open until January 2020 and ANZ will engage with APRA on the proposals.\nIn a discussion paper released earlier today, “Revisions to APS111 Capital Adequacy: Measurement of Capital”, APRA proposes that for each individual subsidiary at Level 1:\n\n\nthe tangible component of the investment up to an amount equal to 10% of ANZ’s net Level 1 Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital will be treated as a 250% risk weighting; and the remainder of the investment will be treated as a full CET1 capital deduction.\nUnder current prudential standards, APRA requires Australian ADIs at Level 1 to treat the tangible component of their investments in an unlisted subsidiary as a 400% risk weighting and the intangible component as a CET1 capital deduction.\nANZ is reviewing the implications for its current investments. The discussion paper provides a capital benefit for investments in small subsidiaries (e.g. China, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Thailand) but has a negative impact for large subsidiaries (i.e. New Zealand).\nThe net impact on the Group is unclear and will depend upon a number of factors including the capitalisation of all its subsidiaries at the time of implementation, the final form of the prudential standard, as well as the effect of management actions being pursued that have the potential to materially offset the impact of these proposals.\nBased on ANZ’s investment in its subsidiaries as at 30 June 2019 and in the absence of any offsetting management actions, this implies a reduction in ANZ’s Level 1 CET1 capital ratio of up to approximately $2.5bn (75 basis points). However, ANZ believes that this outcome is unlikely and, post implementation of management actions, the net capital impact could be minimal.\nThere is no impact on ANZ’s Level 2 CET1 capital ratio arising from these proposed changes.\nThe proposed changes to the prudential standards are effective from January 2021. APRA has noted it is open to working with impacted ADIs on an appropriate transition.\nFor media enquiries contact:\nFor analyst enquiries contact:\nStephen Ries, +61 409 655 551\nJill Campbell, +61 412 047 448\nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited ABN 11 005 357 522"

Previously that date was 17 October 2019, and the parties have agreed to extend that date to 31 December 2019, with each party having the ability to extend that date on a monthly basis up to but not later than 30 June 2020. • changes to warranty caps associated with reduced purchase price and an amendment to the Strategic Alliance Agreement allowing for an earlier termination right by either party.\nIOOF CEO Renato Mota commented “The revised terms reflect both ANZ and IOOF’s commitment to completing the transaction and it delivers greater certainty to ANZ P&I members and clients. Despite a challenging operating environment for wealth management, the strategic rationale for the transaction remains compelling and we continue to be confident in the significant benefits it will deliver.\n“The transaction will meaningfully increase the scale and footprint of our core business as we continue to invest in delivery of member outcomes and execute our strategy to deliver accessible, advice-led wealth management for the benefit of all Australians.\n“We have been supportive of OPC’s need to form its own view that the transfer to IOOF is in the best interests of their members and are pleased to see they have formed that opinion.”\nAmendments to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (Cth) which came into force on 5 July 2019, give the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) an approval power in respect of the acquisition of controlling stakes in Registrable Superannuation Entity (RSE) licensees.\nApproval from APRA remains a requirement for the ANZ P&I transaction to complete. IOOF submitted its final application to APRA for approval on 4 October 2019.\nMr Mota said, “APRA is currently considering our final application in detail and we welcome further engagement with them on IOOF’s delivery of better member outcomes.\n“SPS 5151 will be applicable to all RSEs from January 2020. Our focus on supporting positive member outcomes is underpinned by ongoing stronger governance and higher standards.\nTogether with our key stakeholders, IOOF is committed to restoring trust and improving the lives of our clients and their communities.”\nENDS -\n1 Prudential Standard SPS 515 – Strategic Planning and Member Outcomes, January 2020\nEnquiries:\nMedia enquiries:\nRachel Scully Head of Corporate Affairs IOOF Holdings Ltd P: +61 3 8614 4530 M: +61 438 601 942\nLouise Watson Managing Director Symbol Strategic Communications P: +61 2 8011 0591 M: +61 419 185 674\nE: rachel.scully@ioof.com.au\nE: lwatson@symbolstrategic.com.au\nAbout IOOF Holdings Ltd\nIOOF has been helping Australians secure their financial future since 1846.

    "content": "News Release\nFor Release: 17 October, 2019\nUpdate on OnePath P&I sale to IOOF\nANZ today announced it has agreed a revised price for the sale of its OnePath Pensions & Investments (OnePath P&I) business and Aligned Dealer Groups (ADGs) to IOOF Holdings Limited (IOOF) of $850 million, being a $125 million reduction from the original sale price of $975 million announced in October 2017.\nThe new price of $850 million1 includes ~$25 million that ANZ has already received for the sale of its ADGs in October 2018. The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements.\nANZ Group Executive Wealth, Alexis George said: “This sale remains consistent with our strategy to simplify our operations by focussing on retail and business banking in Australia and New Zealand, and Institutional Banking across the Asia Pacific region. While there has been a reduction in the sale price, there have been offsets included and it also provides certainty for our customers and staff.”\nSubject to APRA approval, ANZ expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020 and is expected to increase ANZ’s APRA CET1 capital ratio by ~20 basis points. The Independent Trustee (OnePath Custodians) and ANZ have both confirmed no objection to the transaction.\nThe sale agreement includes termination rights for both ANZ and IOOF if the remaining condition of APRA approval is not satisfied.\nANZ and IOOF have agreed to extend the relevant date in the agreement to 31 December 2019, with each party having certain rights to further extend this date up until 30 June 2020.\nFor media enquiries contact:\nFor analyst enquiries contact:\nStephen Ries, +61-409-655-551 Nick Higginbottom, +61-403-936-262\nJill Campbell, +61 3 8654 7749 Cameron Davis, +61 3 8654 7716\n1 Subject to completion adjustments Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited ABN 11 005 357 522"

For the 2019 final dividend, ANZ intends to provide shares under the DRP through an on-market purchase and BOP through the issue of new shares. The 'Acquisition Price' to be used in determining the number of shares to be provided under the DRP and BOP will be calculated by reference to the arithmetic average of the daily volume weighted average sale price of all fully paid ANZ ordinary shares sold in the ordinary course of trading on the ASX and Chi-X during the ten trading days commencing on 15 November 2019, and then rounded to the nearest whole cent. Shares provided under the DRP and BOP will rank equally in all respects with existing fully paid ANZ ordinary shares. Election notices from shareholders wanting to commence, cease or vary their participation in the DRP or BOP for the 2019 final dividend must be received by ANZ's Share Registrar by 5.00pm (Australian Eastern Daylight Time) on 13 November 2019. Subject to receiving effective contrary instructions from the shareholder, dividends payable to shareholders with a registered address in the United Kingdom (including the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man) or New Zealand will be converted to Pounds Sterling or New Zealand Dollars respectively at an exchange rate calculated on 15 November 2019.\n1 2\nUnless otherwise noted, all comparisons are to the year ended 30 September 2018.\nCash profit excludes non-core items included in statutory profit and is provided to assist readers in understanding the result of the core business activities of the Group. The non-core\nitems are calculated consistently period on period so as not to discriminate between positive and negative adjustments, and fall into one of the three categories: gains or losses included\nin earnings arising from changes in tax, legal or accounting legislation or other non-core items not associated with the core operations of the Group; treasury shares, revaluation of policy\nliabilities, economic hedging and similar accounting items that represent timing differences that will reverse through earnings in the future; and accounting reclassifications between\nindividual line items that do not impact reported results, such as policyholders tax gross up. Cash profit is not a measure of cash flow or profit determined on a cash basis. The net after\ntax adjustment was an increase to statutory profit of $208 million ($174 million on a continuing basis) made up of several items. Refer pages 77 to 81 for further details.\n3 4\nThe unfranked portion of the dividend will be sourced from ANZ’s conduit foreign income account.\nIt is proposed that the final dividend will be 70% franked per ordinary share for Australian tax purposes (30% tax rate) and carry New Zealand imputation credits of NZD 9 cents per ordinary share.\n2\nRESULTS FOR ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE MARKET\nAPPENDIX 4E\nKPMG has audited the financial statements contained within the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited Annual Report and has issued an unmodified audit report.

Consequently, the Group increased its provision for credit impairment by $813 million through opening retained earnings. Comparative information has not been restated.\nAASB 15 - the main impact of adoption is that certain items previously netted are now presented gross in operating income and operating expenses.\nComparative information has been restated which increased total operating income for the September 2018 full year by $153 million and increased total operating expenses by the same amount.\nFor further details on key requirements and impacts of the changes described above refer to Note 1 and 16 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNON-IFRS INFORMATION\nStatutory profit is prepared in accordance with recognition and measurement requirements of Australian Accounting Standards, which comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Group provides additional measures of performance in the Consolidated Financial Report & Dividend Announcement which are prepared on a basis other than in accordance with accounting standards. The guidance provided in Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Regulatory Guide 230 has been followed when presenting this information.\nCash Profit\nCash profit, a non-IFRS measure, represents ANZ’s preferred measure of the result of the core business activities of the Group, enabling readers to assess Group and Divisional performance against prior periods and against peer institutions. The adjustments made in arriving at cash profit are included in statutory profit which is subject to audit within the context of the external auditor’s audit of the 2019 ANZ Annual Financial Statements (when released). Cash profit is not subject to audit by the external auditor. The external auditor has informed the Audit Committee that cash profit adjustments have been determined on a consistent basis across each period presented.\nAdjustments between statutory profit and cash profit - To calculate cash profit, the Group excludes non-core items from statutory profit. Refer to\npages 77 to 81 for adjustments between statutory and cash profit.\nLarge/Notable items within cash profit - The Group’s cash profit result from continuing operations includes a number of items collectively referred\nto as large/notable items. While these items form part of cash profit, given their nature and significance, they have been presented separately with comparative information, where relevant, to provide transparency and aid comparison. Refer to pages 16 to 20 for details of large/notable items.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nThe financial results of the Wealth Australia businesses being divested and associated Group reclassification and consolidation impacts are treated as discontinued operations from a financial reporting perspective. These businesses qualify as discontinued operations, a subset of assets and liabilities held for sale, as they represent a major line of business.\nThe Group Income Statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income show discontinued operations separately from continuing operations in a separate line item ‘Profit/(Loss) from discontinued operations’.\nSale to IOOF Holdings Limited (IOOF)\nOn 17 October 2017, the Group announced it had agreed to sell its OnePath pensions and investments (OnePath P&I) business and Aligned Dealer Groups (ADGs) businesses to IOOF. The sale of the ADG business completed on 1 October 2018. On 17 October 2019, the Group announced it had agreed a revised sale price for its OnePath P&I business and ADGs to IOOF of $850 million, being a $125 million reduction from the original sale price of $975 million announced in October 2017. The new price of $850 million includes approximately $25 million that ANZ has already received for the sale of ADGs in October 2018. The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements. Subject to APRA approval, the Group expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. The impact of the reduction in price has been reflected in the 2019 financial results.\nSale to Zurich Financial Services Australia (Zurich)\nOn 12 December 2017, ANZ announced that it had agreed to sell its life insurance business to Zurich and regulatory approval was obtained on 10 October 2018. The transaction was completed on 31 May 2019.\n10\nSUMMARY\nIncluded in the ‘Cash loss from discontinued operations’ is:\nA $23 million loss ($81 million loss after tax) was recognised in the September 2019 half. This is attributable to sale related adjustments and write- downs, the reversal of the life-to-date cash profit adjustments on the revaluation of policy liabilities sold to Zurich, partially offset by the recycling of gains previously deferred in equity reserves on sale completion. A $632 million loss (pre and post-tax) was recognised on the reclassification of Wealth Australia discontinued operations businesses to held for sale in the September 2018 full year; and\nCustomer remediation which includes provisions for expected refunds to customers and related remediation costs associated with inappropriate\nadvice or services not provided in the pensions and investments and life insurance businesses.\nHalf Year\nFull Year\nSep-19\nMar-19\nSep-19\n$M\n$M\n$M\nCustomer remediation (pre-tax)\n166\n75\n241\nCustomer remediation (post-tax)\n154\n53\n207\nCONTINUING OPERATIONS\nDivisional Performance\nThe presentation of divisional results has been impacted by a number of methodology and structural changes during the September 2019 full year. Prior period comparatives have been restated:\n\nThe methodology for allocating earnings on capital at a business unit level changed from Economic Capital to Regulatory Capital. While neutral at a Group level, this change impacted net interest income at the divisional level;\n\nThe residual Asia Retail and Wealth businesses have been transferred from the former Asia Retail and Pacific division to Technology, Services & Operations (TSO) and Group Centre division. The remaining segment has been renamed Pacific division; and\n\nANZ’s lenders mortgage insurance, share investing, general insurance distribution and financial planning businesses which were previously part of the continuing operations of Wealth Australia now form part of the Australia Retail and Commercial division (previously named Australia division) and Wealth Australia ceases to exist as a continuing division.\nOther than those described above, there have been no other significant changes impacting divisional performance.\n11\nSep-18\n$M\n181\n127\nSUMMARY\nStatutory Profit Results\nHalf Year\nFull Year\nNet interest income\nSep 19 $M 7,040\nMar 19 $M 7,299\nMovt -4%\nSep 19 $M 14,339\nSep 18 $M 14,514\nMovt -1%\nOther operating income\n2,452\n1,994\n23%\n4,446\n5,470\n19%\nOperating income\n9,492\n9,293\n2%\n18,785\n19,984\n6%\nOperating expenses\n(4,706)\n(4,365)\n8%\n(9,071)\n(9,401)\n4%\nProfit before credit impairment and income tax\n4,786\n4,928\n3%\n9,714\n10,583\n8%\nCredit impairment charge\n(402)\n(392)\n3%\n(794)\n(688)\n15%\nProfit before income tax\n4,384\n4,536\n3%\n8,920\n9,895\n10%\nIncome tax expense\n(1,325)\n(1,284)\n3%\n(2,609)\n(2,784)\n6%\nNon-controlling interests\n(6)\n(9)\n33%\n(15)\n(16)\n6%\nProfit attributable to shareholders of the Company from continuing operations\n3,053\n3,243\n6%\n6,296\n7,095\n11%\nProfit/(Loss) from discontinued operations\n(273)\n(70)\nlarge\n(343)\n(695)\n51%\nProfit attributable to shareholders of the Company\n2,780\n3,173\n12%\n5,953\n6,400\n7%\nEarnings Per Ordinary Share (cents)\nHalf Year\nFull Year\nBasic Diluted\nReference Page 98\n98\nSep 19 98.3\n94.7\nMar 19 111.7\n106.4\nMovt -12%\n11%\nSep 19 210.0\n201.9\nSep 18 221.6\n212.1\nMovt -5%\n5%\nHalf Year\nFull Year\nReference Page\nSep 19 Mar 19\nSep 19\nSep 18\nOrdinary Share Dividends (cents)\nInterim - fully franked1,2\n97\n\n80\n80\n80\nFinal\n97\nfully franked1,2\n97\n\n\n\n80\npartially franked2,3\n97\n80\n\n80\n\nTotal\n97\n80\n80\n160\n160\nOrdinary share dividend payout ratio4\n97\n81.6%\n71.4%\n76.2%\n72.1%\nProfitability Ratios\nReturn on average ordinary shareholders' equity5\n9.3%\n10.8%\n10.0%\n10.9%\nReturn on average assets6\n0.56%\n0.65%\n0.61%\n0.68%\nNet interest margin\n1.72%\n1.79%\n1.75%\n1.87%\nNet interest income to average credit RWAs6\n4.03%\n4.23%\n4.13%\n4.28%\nEfficiency Ratios\nOperating expenses to operating income\n51.8%\n48.6%\n50.2%\n49.6%\nOperating expenses to average assets6\n1.00%\n0.94%\n0.97%\n1.05%\nCredit Impairment Charge/(Release)\nIndividually assessed credit impairment charge ($M)\n398\n379\n777\n773\nCollectively assessed credit impairment charge/(release) ($M)\n4\n13\n17\n(85)\nTotal credit impairment charge ($M)\n102\n402\n392\n794\n688\nIndividually assessed credit impairment charge as a % of average gross loans and advances6,7\n0.13%\n0.12%\n0.13%\n0.13%\nTotal credit impairment charge as a % of average gross loans and advances6,7\n0.13%\n0.13%\n0.13%\n0.12%\n1.

See page 46 for further details regarding the differences between APRA Basel 3 and Internationally Comparable Basel 3 standards. 3. Liquidity Coverage Ratio is calculated on a half year average basis. 4. In the September 2019 half, ANZ implemented a more market responsive collateral valuation methodology for the home loan portfolio in Australia which increased the number of home loans being classified as impaired rather than past due. Comparative information has not been restated for this change in methodology. Additionally, refinement to underlying data resulted in a transfer from past due and sub-standard categories into impaired assets. Comparative information has been restated with a transfer of $106 million at March 2019 and $126 million at September 2018.\n5. On adoption of AASB 9 on 1 October 2018, the Group increased the collectively assessed provision by $813 million. Comparative information has not been restated 6. Equals total shareholders’ equity less total non-controlling interests, goodwill and other intangible assets. 7.

The Group provides additional measures of performance in the Consolidated Financial Report & Dividend Announcement which are prepared on a basis other than in accordance with accounting standards. The guidance provided in Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Regulatory Guide 230 has been followed when presenting this information.\nCash Profit\nCash profit, a non-IFRS measure, represents ANZ’s preferred measure of the result of the core business activities of the Group, enabling readers to assess Group and Divisional performance against prior periods and against peer institutions. To calculate cash profit, the Group excludes non-core items from statutory profit (refer to Definitions on pages 128 to 129 for further details). The adjustments made in arriving at cash profit are included in statutory profit which is subject to audit within the context of the external auditor’s audit of the 2019 ANZ Annual Financial Statements (when released). Cash profit is not subject to audit by the external auditor. The external auditor has informed the Audit Committee that cash profit adjustments have been determined on a consistent basis across each period presented.\nThe Group Results section is reported on a cash profit basis for continuing operations unless otherwise stated.

Excluding foreign currency translation movements, cash profit decreased $54 million (-1%).\nNet interest income decreased $175 million (-1%) largely due to lower interest rates and competitive pressures resulting in a 11 basis point\ndecrease in the net interest margin, partially offset by 5% growth in average interest earning assets. The lower net interest margin reflects growth in lower margin Markets Balance Sheet activities, higher proportionate growth in the lower Institutional business, customer switching to principal and interest in Australia home loans, deposit margin compression and lower earnings on capital, partially offset by the impact of home loans repricing. The increase in average interest earning assets reflects growth in Institutional banking portfolios and home loan growth in the New Zealand division. Refer to pages 26 and 27 for further details on key movements.\nOther operating income decreased $163 million (-3%) largely as the result of net divestment impacts of $198 million, a $120 million decrease in\nnet fee and commission income, and $130 million decrease primarily in other income attributable to realised losses on economic hedges against foreign currency denominated revenue streams (which offset favourable foreign currency translations elsewhere in the Group) and a reduction in income from the lenders mortgage insurance business. This was partially offset by higher Markets other operating income of $154 million, a $79 million increase in share of associate’s profit and a $52 million decrease in customer remediation within other operating income. Refer to pages 28 to 30 for further details on key movements.\nOperating expenses decreased $330 million (-4%) primarily due to an accelerated software amortisation charge in the prior period of $251\nmillion, lower restructuring expenses of $150 million, a reduction in expenses following the sale of OnePath Life (NZ) and Asia Retail and Wealth businesses of $60 million, lower Royal Commission legal costs of $40 million and lower FTE. This was partially offset by higher customer remediation of $182 million within operating expenses, inflation, the impact of foreign currency translation and regulatory compliance spend in New Zealand. Refer to pages 31 to 32 for further details on key movements.\nCredit impairment charges increased $107 million (+16%) largely due to higher collectively assessed credit impairment charges, primarily as a result of the prior period benefitting from the release of temporary economic overlays and a greater number of customer upgrades. Refer to pages 34 and 35 for further details on key movements.\nExcluding large/notable items, cash profit decreased $96 million (-1%).\nSeptember 2019 v March 2019\nCash profit from continuing operations decreased $658 million (-18%) compared with the March 2019 half. Excluding foreign currency translation movements, cash profit decreased $669 million (-19%).\nNet interest income decreased $259 million (-4%) largely due to lower interest rates and competitive pressures resulting in a 8 basis point decrease in the net interest margin. The lower net interest margin reflects deposit margin compression from lower interest rates, higher proportionate growth in the lower Institutional business, customer switching to principal and interest in Australia home loans and asset competition. This was partially offset by lower funding costs and the impact of home loans re-pricing. Refer to pages 26 and 27 for further details on key movements.\nOther operating income decreased $204 million (-8%) largely as a result of net divestment impacts of $241 million and lower Markets other\noperating income of $47 million. This was partially offset by a $49 million increase in net fee and commission income, $22 million increase in other income and lower customer remediation of $13 million within other operating income. Refer to pages 28 to 30 for further details on key movements.\nOperating expenses increased $341 million (+8%) primarily due to higher customer remediation of $301 million within operating expenses,\nhigher investment and marketing spend and the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by lower restructuring expenses of $25 million and Royal Commission legal costs of $11 million. Refer to pages 31 to 32 for further details on key movements.\nCredit impairment charges increased $9 million (+2%) largely due to higher individually assessed credit impairment charges, partially offset by\nlower collectively assessed credit impairment charges.

The increase in the New Zealand division was primarily due to release of a temporary economic overlay in 2018, followed by a new temporary economic overlay in 2019. The increase in the Institutional division was due to a greater number of customer upgrades in the prior period.\nSeptember 2019 v March 2019\nThe collectively assessed credit impairment charge decreased by $9 million (-69%) primarily driven by an $85 million decrease in the Australia Retail and Commercial division, partially offset by a $56 million increase in the Institutional division and a $22 million increase in the New Zealand division. The decrease in the Australia Retail and Commercial division was primarily due to the downward revision of forward looking economic scenario weights for the Australian geography in the March 2019 half, as well as part release of a temporary management overlay in the September 2019 half. The increase in the Institutional division was primarily due to a greater number of customers downgrades compared to the prior period. The increase in the New Zealand division was due to the downward revision of forward looking economic scenario weights, along with a temporary economic overlay in the September 2019 half.\nIndividually assessed credit impairment charge\nSeptember 2019 v September 2018\nThe individually assessed credit impairment charge increased by $5 million (+1%) primarily due to lower write-backs and recoveries in the New Zealand and Institutional divisions, partially offset by higher write-backs and recoveries in the Australia Retail and Commercial division and a decrease due to the sale of the Asia Retail and Wealth businesses in the prior year.\nSeptember 2019 v March 2019\nThe individually assessed credit impairment charge increased by $18 million (+5%) driven by increased provisions in the Institutional, Australia Retail and Commercial and New Zealand divisions. The increase in the Australia Retail and Commercial division is due to higher new and increased provision following the implementation of a more market responsive collateral valuation methodology for the Australian home loan portfolio.\n35\nTotal $M\n316\n33\n57\n(3)\n(1)\n402\nTotal $M\n396\n(35)\n30\n2\n\n393\nGROUP RESULTS\nAllowance for expected credit losses1,2\nCollectively assessed\nIndividually assessed\nTotal provision\nAs at\nAs at\nAs at\nDivision Australia Retail and Commercial Institutional\nNew Zealand\nPacific\nTSO and Group Centre\nTotal3\nSep 19 $M\n1,795\n1,169\n374\n38\n\n3,376\nSep 18 $M\n1,125\n1,073\n279\n43\n3\n2,523\nMovt\n60% 9% 34% -12% -100% 34%\nSep 19 $M\n558\n160\n72\n24\n\n814\nSep 18 $M\n569\n251\n81\n18\n1\n920\nMovt\n2% -36% -11% 33% -100% -12%\nSep 19 $M\n2,353\n1,329\n446\n62\n\n4,190\nSep 18 $M\n1,694\n1,324\n360\n61\n4\n3,443\nCollectively assessed\nIndividually assessed\nTotal provision\nAs at\nAs at\nAs at\nDivision Australia Retail and Commercial Institutional\nNew Zealand\nPacific\nTSO and Group Centre\nTotal3\nSep 19 $M\n1,795\n1,169\n374\n38\n\n3,376\nMar 19 $M\n1,834\n1,132\n369\n43\n\n3,378\nMovt\n2% 3% 1% -12% n/a 0%\nSep 19 $M\n558\n160\n72\n24\n\n814\nMar 19 $M\n586\n208\n73\n24\n\n891\nMovt\n5% -23% -1% 0% n/a -9%\nSep 19 $M\n2,353\n1,329\n446\n62\n\n4,190\nMar 19 $M\n2,420\n1,340\n442\n67\n\n4,269\nAs at Sep 19\nCollectively Assessed\nIndividually Assessed\nDivision Australia Retail and Commercial\nStage 1 $M 370\nStage 2 $M 1,082\nStage 3 $M 343\nTotal $M 1,795\nStage 3 $M 558\nInstitutional\n872\n257\n40\n1,169\n160\nNew Zealand\n152\n182\n40\n374\n72\nPacific\n18\n9\n11\n38\n24\nTotal3\n1,412\n1,530\n434\n3,376\n814\nAs at Mar 19\nCollectively Assessed\nIndividually Assessed\nDivision Australia Retail and Commercial\nStage 1 $M 384\nStage 2 $M 1,150\nStage 3 $M 300\nTotal $M 1,834\nStage 3 $M 586\nInstitutional\n859\n234\n39\n1,132\n208\nNew Zealand\n152\n173\n44\n369\n73\nPacific\n20\n11\n12\n43\n24\nTotal3\n1,415\n1,568\n395\n3,378\n891\n1.

In the September 2019 half, ANZ implemented a more market responsive collateral valuation methodology for the home loan portfolio in Australia which increased the number of home loans being classified as impaired rather than past due. Comparative information has not been restated for the change in methodology. Additionally, refinement to underlying processes and associated data resulted in the transfer of loans from past due and sub-standard categories into impaired assets. Comparative information has been restated with a transfer of $106 million at March 2019 and $126 million at September 2018.\n3. Restructured items are facilities where the original contractual terms have been modified for reasons related to the financial difficulties of the customer. Restructuring may consist of reduction of interest, principal or other payments legally due, or an extension in maturity materially beyond those typically offered to new facilities with similar risk.\nSeptember 2019 v September 2018\nGross impaired assets decreased $110 million (-5%) driven by the Institutional division (-$177 million) with repayments reducing a number of large impaired assets. This was partially offset by an increase in the Australia Retail and Commercial division ($57 million) primarily driven by a number of single name impaired loans in the Commercial portfolio. The Group’s individually assessed provision coverage ratio on impaired assets was 40.1% at 30 September 2019 (Sep 18: 43.0%).\nSeptember 2019 v March 2019\nGross impaired assets decreased $99 million (-5%) driven by the Institutional division ($108 million) due to repayments and write-offs. This was partially offset by the Australia Retail and Commercial ($5 million) and the New Zealand division ($7 million).

Comparative information has not been restated for the change in methodology.\nSeptember 2019 v September 2018\nNew impaired assets decreased $101 million (-5%) primarily driven by the Institutional division as the result of an improved risk profile due to portfolio rebalancing, combined with a benign credit environment. In addition, new impaired assets decreased due to lending reductions following the sale of Asia Retail and Wealth businesses. This was partially offset by an increase in the Australia Retail and Commercial division.\nSeptember 2019 v March 2019\nNew impaired assets increased by $227 million (26%) driven by the Australia Retail and Commercial and New Zealand division. The increase in the Australia Retail and Commercial division is primarily driven by an increase of $167 million from the implementation of a more market responsive collateral valuation methodology for the Australian home loan portfolio.

This is used for internal management purposes and is not subject to audit by the external auditor.\nEconomic profit is calculated via a series of adjustments to cash profit. The economic credit cost adjustment replaces the accounting credit loss charge with internal expected loss based on the average long-run loss rate per annum on the portfolio over an economic cycle. The benefit of imputation credits is recognised, measured at 70% of Australian tax. The cost of capital is a major component of economic profit. At an ANZ Group level, this is calculated using average ordinary shareholders’ equity (excluding non-controlling interests), multiplied by the cost of capital rate (9.0% for the September 2019 half and 10.0% for the March 2019 half with the average of 9.5% being applied to the September 2018 full year for comparative purposes). At a business unit level, capital is allocated based on Regulatory Capital, whereby higher risk businesses attract higher levels of capital. The basis of allocation was changed from Economic Capital to Regulatory Capital in the March 2019 half and comparative information was restated. This method is designed to help drive appropriate risk management and ensure business returns align with the level of risk. Key risks covered include credit risk, operational risk, market risk and other risks.\nEconomic profit decreased by $11 million (-1%) against the September 2018 full year driven by higher cost of capital, partially offset by favourable economic credit cost adjustment and higher imputation credits.\nEconomic profit decreased by $480 million (-49%) against the March 2019 half driven by lower cash profit and lower imputation credits, partially offset by lower cost of capital.\n42\nMovt 0%\nn/a\nn/a\n0%\n2%\n0%\nMovt\n11%\nlarge\n0%\n23%\n2%\n3%\n4%\n1%\nGROUP RESULTS\nCondensed Balance Sheet - including discontinued operations\nAs at\nMovement\nAssets Cash / Settlement balances owed to ANZ / Collateral paid\nSep 19 $B 100.3\nMar 19 $B 109.9\nSep 18 $B 98.0\nSep 19 v.

The timing mismatch of cash flows and the related liquidity risk is inherent in all banking operations and is closely monitored by the Group and managed in accordance with the risk appetite set by the Board.\nThe Group’s approach to liquidity risk management incorporates two key components:\nScenario modelling of funding sources\nANZ’s liquidity risk appetite is defined by the ability to meet a range of regulatory requirements and internal liquidity metrics mandated by the Board. The metrics cover a range of scenarios of varying duration and level of severity. The objective of this framework is to:\nProvide protection against shorter term extreme market dislocation and stress.\nMaintain structural strength in the balance sheet by ensuring that an appropriate amount of longer-term assets are funded with longer-term\nfunding.\nEnsure that no undue timing concentrations exist in the Group’s funding profile.\nA key component of this framework is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which is a severe short term liquidity stress scenario mandated by banking regulators including APRA. As part of meeting LCR requirements, ANZ has a Committed Liquidity Facility (CLF) with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The CLF has been established to offset the shortage of available High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) in Australia and provides an alternative form of contingent liquidity. The total amount of the CLF available to a qualifying Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) is set annually by APRA. From 1 January 2019, ANZ’s CLF is $48.0 billion (2018 calendar year end: $46.9 billion).\nLiquid assets\nThe Group holds a portfolio of high quality unencumbered liquid assets in order to protect the Group’s liquidity position in a severely stressed environment, as well as to meet regulatory requirements. High Quality Liquid Assets comprise three categories, with the definitions consistent with Basel 3 LCR:\nHighest-quality liquid assets (HQLA1): Cash, highest credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities eligible for repurchase\nwith central banks to provide same-day liquidity.\nHigh-quality liquid assets (HQLA2): High credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities, high quality corporate debt securities\nand high quality covered bonds eligible for repurchase with central banks to provide same-day liquidity.\nAlternative liquid assets (ALA): Assets qualifying as collateral for the CLF and other eligible securities listed by the Reserve Bank of New\nZealand (RBNZ).\nThe Group monitors and manages the size and composition of its liquid assets portfolio on an ongoing basis in line with regulatory requirements and the risk appetite set by the Board.\nHalf Year Average\nMovement\nSep 19 $B\nMar 19 $B\nSep 18 $B\nSep 19 v.

Other CRWA changes are mainly net impacts from RWA Imposts including impacts from implementation of SA-CCR and risk weight floors for NZ mortgages and farm lending portfolios, partially offset by CRWA reduction from asset divestments. The increase in non-CRWA of $8.1 billion mainly reflects higher Operational Risk RWA which includes the Operational Risk capital overlay from APRA in relation to the major banks’ risk governance self-assessments.\nAPRA to Internationally Comparable1 Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1 ratio) as at 30 September 2019\n1. ANZ’s interpretation of the regulations documented in the Basel Committee publications: “Basel 3: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems” (June 2011) and “International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards” (June 2006). Also includes differences identified in APRA’s information paper entitled “International Capital Comparison Study” (13 July 2015).\nThe above provides a reconciliation of the CET1 ratio under APRA’s Basel 3 prudential capital standards to Internationally Comparable Basel 3 standards. APRA views the Basel 3 reforms as a minimum requirement and hence has not incorporated some of the concessions proposed in the Basel 3 rules and has also set higher requirements in other areas. As a result, Australian banks’ Basel 3 reported capital ratios will not be directly comparable with international peers. The International Comparable Basel 3 CET1 ratio incorporates differences between APRA and both the Basel Committee Basel 3 framework (including differences identified in the March 2014 Basel Committee’s Regulatory Consistency Assessment Programme (RCAP) on Basel 3 implementation in Australia) and its application in major offshore jurisdictions.\nThe material differences between APRA Basel 3 and Internationally Comparable Basel 3 ratios include:\nDeductions\n\nInvestments in insurance and banking associates - APRA requires full deduction against CET1. On an Internationally Comparable basis, these investments are subject to a concessional threshold before a deduction is required.\nDeferred tax assets - A full deduction is required from CET1 for deferred tax assets (DTA) relating to temporary differences. On an Internationally\nComparable basis, this is first subject to a concessional threshold before the deduction is required.\nRisk Weighted Assets (RWA)\nMortgages RWA - APRA imposes a floor of 20% on the downturn Loss Given Default (LGD) used in credit RWA calculations for residential\nmortgages. The Internationally Comparable Basel 3 framework requires a downturn LGD floor of 10%. Additionally, from July 2016, APRA requires a higher correlation factor than the Basel framework.\n\nIRRBB RWA - APRA requires inclusion of Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) within the RWA base for the CET1 ratio calculation. This is not required on an Internationally Comparable basis.\nSpecialised lending - APRA requires the supervisory slotting approach to be used in determining credit RWA for specialised lending exposures. The\nInternationally Comparable basis allows for the advanced internal ratings based approach to be used when calculating RWA for these exposures.\nUnsecured Corporate Lending LGD - an adjustment to align ANZ’s unsecured corporate lending LGD to 45% to be consistent with banks in other\njurisdictions. The 45% LGD rate is also used in the Foundation Internal Ratings-Based approach (FIRB).\n Undrawn Corporate Lending Exposure at Default (EAD) - an adjustment to ANZ’s credit conversion factors (CCF) for undrawn corporate loan\ncommitments to 75% (used in FIRB approach) to align with banks in other jurisdictions.\n48\nGROUP RESULTS\nLeverage Ratio - including discontinued operations\nAt 30 September 2019, the Group’s APRA Leverage Ratio was 5.6% which is above the 3.5% APRA proposed minimum for internal ratings-based approach ADI (IRB ADI) which includes ANZ.

Prior period numbers have not been restated for the impact of AASB 15 to align with previously reported regulatory returns.\nSeptember 2019 v September 2018\nAPRA leverage ratio increased 11 bps during the year. Key drivers of the movement were:\nNet organic capital generation (largely from cash profit excluding large/notable and one-off items) less dividends paid during the year (+23 bps).\nExposure growth including derivatives which collectively reduced the leverage ratio by 11 bps.\nNet other impacts included the on-market share buy-back completed in the March 2019 half, customer remediation impacts, foreign currency\ntranslation movements, deferred tax assets and other items, partially offset by benefits from asset divestments (-1 bps).\nSeptember 2019 v March 2019\nAPRA leverage ratio increased 19 bps during the September 2019 half. Key drivers of the movement were:\nNet organic capital generation (largely from cash profit excluding large/notable and one-off items) less dividends paid during the September 2019\nhalf (+12 bps).\nExposure growth (-1 bps).\nNet other impacts included benefits from asset divestments, partially offset by customer remediation impacts, foreign currency translation\nmovements, deferred tax assets and other items (+8 bps).\n49\nGROUP RESULTS\nCapital Management – Other Regulatory Developments\nFinancial System Inquiry (FSI)\nThe Australian Government completed a comprehensive inquiry into Australia’s financial system in 2014 which included a number of key recommendations that may have an impact on regulatory capital levels. APRA initiatives in support of the FSI are:\n\nIn July 2017, APRA released an information paper outlining its assessment on the additional capital required for the Australian banking sector to be considered ‘unquestionably strong’ as originally outlined in the FSI final report in December 2014. APRA indicated that “in the case of the four major Australian banks, this equated to a benchmark CET1 capital ratio, under the current capital adequacy framework, of at least 10.5 percent. APRA also stated that the major banks should meet this benchmark by 1 January 2020 at the latest”.\nAPRA is currently consulting on the revisions to the capital framework that will produce ‘unquestionably strong’ capital ratios with the release of their proposals on revisions to credit risk, operational risk, market risk and interest rate risk in the banking book requirements in February 2018, June 2019 and September 2019. While the final forms of these proposals will only be determined later in 2020, the Group expects the implementation of any revisions to the current requirements will result in further changes to the risk weighting framework for certain asset classes and other risk types (such as market and operational risk). APRA has announced that it does not expect that the changes to the risk weights will necessitate further increases in capital for ADIs, although this could vary by ADI depending on the final requirements.\nAPRA released a discussion paper in August 2018 on adjustments to the overall design of the capital framework to improve transparency,\ninternational comparability and flexibility of the ADI capital framework. The focus of the proposals is on the presentation of the capital ratios to facilitate comparability whilst recognising the relative capital strength of ADIs and measures to enhance supervisory flexibility in times of financial stress. APRA’s consultation for the above is currently taking place with final prudential standards planned to be made available by 2020.\nAPRA’s consultation for the above is currently taking place with target implementation by 2022 without any phase-in arrangements. Given the number of items that are currently open for consultation with APRA, the final outcome of the FSI including any further changes to APRA’s prudential standards or other impacts on the Group remains uncertain.\nAPRA Total Loss Absorbing Capacity Requirements\nIn July 2019, APRA announced its decision on loss-absorbing capacity in which it will require domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs), including ANZ, to increase their Total Capital by 3% of risk-weighted assets by January 2024. Based on ANZ’s capital position as at 30 September 2019, this represents an incremental increase in the Total Capital requirement of approximately $12 billion, with an equivalent decrease in other senior funding. APRA has stated that it anticipates that D-SIBs would satisfy the requirement predominantly with Tier 2 capital.\nRevisions to Related Entities Framework\nAPRA announced in August 2019 that it will implement its proposal to reduce limits for Australian ADIs’ exposure to related entities, reducing limits from 50% of Level 1 Total capital to 25% of Level 1 Tier 1 capital from January 2021. As exposures are measured net of capital deductions, the proposed changes to APRA’s capital regulations (contained in APS111 below) would affect the measurement of ADI exposures. On the basis that the APS111 revisions are implemented as currently proposed, the reduction in the above limits is not expected to have a material impact on ANZ and its subsidiaries.\nRevisions to APS111 Capital Adequacy\nIn October 2019, APRA released a discussion paper on draft revisions to the prudential standards APS111 Capital Adequacy: Measurement of Capital for consultation. The most material change from APRA’s proposal is in relation to the treatment of capital investments for each banking and insurance subsidiary at Level 1 with the tangible component of the investment changing from 400% risk weighting to:\n\n250% risk weighting up to an amount equal to 10% of ANZ’s net Level 1 Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1); and\n\nthe remainder of the investment will be treated as a CET1 capital deduction.\nANZ is reviewing the implications for its current investments. The net impact on the Group is unclear and will depend upon a number of factors including the capitalisation of the affected subsidiaries at the time of implementation, the final form of the prudential standard, as well as the effect of management actions being pursued that have the potential to materially offset the impact of these proposals. Based on ANZ’s current investment in its affected subsidiaries and in the absence of any offsetting management actions, the above proposals implies a reduction in ANZ’s Level 1 CET1 capital ratio of up to approximately $2.5bn (~75 basis points). However, ANZ believes that this outcome is unlikely and, post implementation of management actions, the net capital impact could be minimal. There is no impact on ANZ’s Level 2 CET1 capital ratio arising from these proposed changes, which are proposed to be implemented from 1 January 2021.\nLevel 3 Conglomerates (Level 3)\nAPRA is extending its prudential supervision framework to Conglomerate Groups via the Level 3 framework which will regulate a bancassurance group such as ANZ as a single economic entity with minimum capital requirements and additional monitoring of risk exposure levels.\nIn August 2016, APRA confirmed the deferral of capital requirements for Conglomerate Groups to allow for the final capital requirements arising from FSI recommendations and from international initiatives to be determined.\nThe non-capital components of the Level 3 framework relating to group governance, risk exposures, intragroup transactions and other risk management and compliance requirements came into effect on 1 July 2017. These have had no material impact on the Group’s capital position.\n50\nGROUP RESULTS\n The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) review of capital requirements\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has been reviewing its New Zealand capital adequacy framework. The RBNZ expects to announce its finalised policy decisions in early December 2019 which include the outcomes of the RBNZ consultation relating to the amount, form and timing of implementation. This may include amongst other things:\n\nincreases in the risk weighting applied to the assets of banks in New Zealand;\n\nincreases to the percentage of capital held against those risk weights in New Zealand; and\n\nchanges to the regulatory capital criteria for subordinated instruments.\nThe overall impact on the Group depends on a number of factors. These include the outcome of the RBNZ consultations, ANZ New Zealand’s balance sheet at the time of implementation, and the outcome of other reviews currently underway by APRA.\n51\nGROUP RESULTS\nThis page has been left blank intentionally\n52\nDIVISIONAL RESULTS\nCONTENTS\nDivisional Performance - continuing operations\nAustralia Retail and Commercial - continuing operations\nInstitutional - continuing operations\nNew Zealand - continuing operations\nPacific - continuing operations\nTechnology, Services & Operations (TSO) and Group Centre - continuing operations\n53\nPage\n54\n59\n63\n70\n75\n75\nDIVISIONAL RESULTS\nDivisional Performance - continuing operations\nThe Group operates on a divisional structure with five continuing divisions: Australia Retail and Commercial, Institutional, New Zealand, Pacific, and Technology, Services & Operations (TSO) and Group Centre. For further information on the composition of divisions, refer to the Definitions on page 130.\nThe presentation of divisional results has been impacted by a number of methodology and structural changes during the period. Prior period comparatives have been restated:\n\nThe methodology for allocating earnings on capital at a business unit level changed from Economic Capital to Regulatory Capital. While neutral at a Group level, this change impacted net interest income at the divisional level;\n\nThe residual Asia Retail and Wealth businesses have been transferred from the former Asia Retail and Pacific division to TSO and Group Centre division. The remaining segment has been renamed Pacific division; and\n\nANZ’s lenders mortgage insurance, share investing, general insurance distribution and financial planning businesses which were previously part of the continuing operations of Wealth Australia now form part of the Australia Retail and Commercial division (previously named Australia division) and Wealth Australia ceases to exist as a continuing division.\nThe divisional results were also impacted by the adoption of two new accounting standards:\n\nAASB 9 - the Group implemented an expected credit loss methodology for impairment of financial assets, and revised the classification and measurement of certain financial assets from 1 October 2018. Consequently, the Group increased its provision for credit impairment by $813 million through opening retained earnings. Comparative information has not been restated.\n\nAASB 15 - the main impact of adoption is that certain items previously netted are now presented gross in operating income and operating expenses. Comparative information has been restated which increased total operating income for the September 2018 full year by $153 million and increased total operating expenses by the same amount.\nOther than those described above, there have been no other significant changes.\nThe Divisional Results section is reported on a cash profit basis for continuing operations. For information on discontinued operations please refer to the Guide to Full Year Results on page 10.\nThe divisions reported are consistent with internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker, being the Chief Executive Officer.\n54\nDIVISIONAL RESULTS\nCash profit by division -

The guidance provided in ASIC’s Regulatory Guide 230 has been followed when presenting this information.\nAdjustments between statutory profit and cash profit\nCash profit represents ANZ’s preferred measure of the result of the core business activities of the Group, enabling readers to assess Group and Divisional performance against prior periods and against peer institutions. To calculate cash profit, the Group excludes non-core items from statutory profit (refer to Definitions for further details). The adjustments made in arriving at cash profit are included in statutory profit which is subject to audit within the context of the external auditor’s audit of the 2019 ANZ Annual Financial Statements (when released). Cash profit is not subject to audit by the external auditor. The external auditor has informed the Audit Committee that cash profit adjustments have been determined on a consistent basis across each period presented.\nHalf Year\nFull Year\nSep 19 $M\nMar 19 $M\nMovt\nSep 19 $M\nSep 18 $M\nStatutory profit attributable to shareholders of the Company from continuing operations\n3,053\n3,243\n6%\n6,296\n7,095\nAdjustments between statutory profit and cash profit from continuing operations\nRevaluation of policy liabilities\n\n77\n100%\n77\n(14)\nEconomic hedges\n(67)\n185\nlarge\n118\n(248)\nRevenue and expense hedges\n(79)\n60\nlarge\n(19)\n(9)\nStructured credit intermediation trades\n(1)\n(1)\n0%\n(2)\n(4)\nSale of SRCB\n\n\nn/a\n\n(333)\nTotal adjustments between statutory profit and cash profit from continuing operations\n(147)\n321\nlarge\n174\n(608)\nCash profit from continuing operations\n2,906\n3,564\n18%\n6,470\n6,487\nStatutory profit attributable to shareholders of the Company from discontinued operations\n(273)\n(70)\nlarge\n(343)\n(695)\nAdjustments between statutory profit and cash profit from discontinued operations\nTreasury shares adjustment\n7\n(18)\nlarge\n(11)\n7\nRevaluation of policy liabilities\n7\n38\n82%\n45\n6\nTotal adjustments between statutory profit and cash profit from discontinued operations\n14\n20\n30%\n34\n13\nCash profit/(loss) from discontinued operations\n(259)\n(50)\nlarge\n(309)\n(682)\nCash profit\n2,647\n3,514\n25%\n6,161\n5,805\nExplanation of adjustments between statutory profit and cash profit - continuing operations\nRevaluation of policy liabilities – OnePath Life (NZ)\nWhen calculating policy liabilities, the projected future cash flows on insurance contracts are discounted to reflect the present value of the obligation, with the impact of changes in the market discount rate each period being reflected in the Income Statement. ANZ includes the impact on the re- measurement of insurance contracts attributable to changes in market discount rates as an adjustment to statutory profit to remove the volatility attributable to changes in market interest rates which revert to zero over the life of insurance contracts. With the sale completion of the OnePath Life (NZ) Ltd business, the March 2019 half includes the reversal of the life-to-date cash profit adjustments on the revaluation of policy liabilities sold, increasing cash profit before tax by $115 million ($81 million after tax).\nEconomic and revenue and expense hedges\nThe Group enters into economic hedges to manage its interest rate and foreign exchange risk which, in accordance with accounting standards, result in fair value gains and losses being recognised within the Income Statement. ANZ removes the fair value adjustments from cash profit since the profit or loss resulting from the hedge transactions will reverse over time to match with the profit or loss from the economically hedged item as part of cash profit. This includes gains and losses arising from approved classes of derivatives not designated in accounting hedge relationships but which are considered to be economic hedges, including hedges of larger foreign exchange denominated revenue and expense streams, primarily NZD and USD (and USD correlated), as well as ineffectiveness from designated accounting hedges. Economic hedges comprise:\n\nFunding related swaps (primarily cross currency interest rate swaps) used to convert the proceeds of foreign currency debt issuances into floating rate Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar debt. As these swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting, movements in the fair values are recorded in the Income Statement. The main drivers of these fair values are currency basis spreads and Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar fluctuations against other major funding currencies.\n78\nMovt\n11%\nlarge\nlarge\nlarge\n50%\n100%\nlarge\n0%\n51%\nlarge\nlarge\nlarge\n55%\n6%\nPROFIT RECONCILIATION\n\nEconomic hedges of select structured finance and specialised leasing transactions that do not qualify for hedge accounting. The main drivers of these fair value adjustments are movements in the Australian and New Zealand term structure of interest rates.\n\nIneffectiveness from designated accounting hedge relationships.\nIn the September 2019 full year, the majority of the loss on economic hedges adjusted from cash profit relates to funding related swaps, principally from narrowing basis spreads on AUD/USD and NZD/USD currency pairs partially offset by the weakening of both the AUD and NZD against USD.\nThe gain on revenue and expense hedges adjusted from cash profit in the September 2019 full year was mainly due to the strengthening of AUD against the NZD in the second half 2019.\nHalf Year\nFull Year\nEconomic hedges\nRevenue and expense hedges\nIncrease/(decrease) to cash profit before tax\nIncrease/(decrease) to cash profit after tax\nSep 19 $M (96)\n(111)\n(207)\n(146)\nMar 19 $M 260 85 345 245\nSep 19 $M 164\n(26)\n138\n99\nStructured credit intermediation trades\nANZ entered into a series of structured credit intermediation trades prior to the Global Financial Crisis with eight US financial guarantors. This involved selling credit default swaps (CDSs) as protection over specific debt structures and purchasing CDS protection over the same structures. ANZ has subsequently exited its positions with six US financial guarantors and is monitoring the remaining two portfolios with a view to reducing the exposures when ANZ deems it cost effective relative to the perceived risk associated with a specific trade or counterparty.\nThe notional value of outstanding bought and sold CDSs at 30 September 2019 amounted to $0.3 billion (Mar 19: $0.3 billion; Sep 18: $0.3 billion). While both the bought and sold CDSs are measured at fair value through profit and loss, the associated fair value movements do not fully offset due to the impact of credit risk on the bought CDSs which is driven by market movements in credit spreads and AUD/USD and NZD/USD rates. The fair value of the CDSs (excluding CVA) is $19 million (Mar 19: $20 million; Sep 18: $26 million) with CVA on the bought protection of $3 million (Mar 19: $4 million; Sep 18: $4 million).\nThe profit and loss associated with the bought and sold protection is included as an adjustment to cash profit as it relates to a legacy business where, unless terminated early, the fair value movements are expected to reverse to zero in future periods.\nSale of Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank (SRCB)\nOn 3 January 2017, the Group announced that it had agreed to sell its 20% stake in Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank (SRCB).\nThe impact of SRCB has been treated as an adjustment between statutory profit to cash profit. The rationale being the loss on reclassification to held for sale was expected to be largely offset by the release of reserve gains on sale completion within the 2017 full year. The transaction was subsequently completed in the 2018 full year and the entire impact of the transaction was recognised in cash profit.\nCredit risk on impaired derivatives (nil profit after tax impact)\nDerivative credit valuation adjustments on defaulted and impaired derivative exposures are reclassified to cash credit impairment charges to reflect the manner in which the defaulted and impaired derivatives are managed.\nExplanation of adjustments between statutory profit and cash profit - discontinued operations\nTreasury shares adjustment\nANZ shares held by the Group in Wealth Australia discontinued operations are deemed to be Treasury shares for accounting purposes. Dividends and realised and unrealised gains and losses from these shares are reversed as they are not permitted to be recognised as income for statutory reporting purposes. In deriving cash profit, these earnings are included to ensure there is no asymmetrical impact on the Group’s profits because the Treasury shares are held to support policy liabilities which are revalued through the Income Statement. With the sale completion of the life insurance business to Zurich, there are no further ANZ shares held by the Group in Wealth Australia discontinued operations (Mar 19: 15.5 million shares; Sep 18: 15.5 million shares).\nRevaluation of policy liabilities - Wealth Australia discontinued operations\nWhen calculating policy liabilities, the projected future cash flows on insurance contracts are discounted to reflect the present value of the obligation, with the impact of changes in the market discount rate each period being reflected in the Income Statement. ANZ includes the impact on the re- measurement of the insurance contract attributable to changes in market discount rates as an adjustment to statutory profit to remove the volatility attributable to changes in market interest rates which reverts to zero over the life of the insurance contract. With the sale completion of the life insurance business to Zurich, the September 2019 half includes the reversal of the life-to-date cash profit adjustments on the revaluation of policy liabilities sold, reducing cash profit before tax by $22 million ($15 million after tax).\n79\nSep 18 $M (349)\n(12)\n(361)\n(257)\nN O T A L C N O C E R T F O R P\nI\nI\nI\nI\nt i f o r p y r o t u t a t s o t\ns t n e m t s u d A\nj\nd e r u t c u r t S\nl a t o T\nk s i r\nt i d e r C\nt i d e r c\nd n a\ne u n e v e R\nn o i t a u a v e R\nl\ny r u s a e r T\no t s t n e m t s u d a\nj\nd e r i a p m\ni\nn o\nn o i t a i d e m r e t n\ni\ne s n e p x e\nc m o n o c E\ni\ny c\ni l\no p f o\ns e r a h s\nt i f o r p h s a C\nt i f o r p y r o t u t a t s\nB C R S\nf o e l a S\ns e v i t a v i r e d\ns e d a r t\ns e g d e h\ns e g d e h\ns e i t i l i\nb a\ni l\nt n e m t s u d a\nj\nt i f o r p y r o t u t a t S\nM $\nM $\nM $\nM $\nM $\nM $\nM $\nM $\nM $\nM $\nr a e Y\nl l\nu F 9 1 0 2 r e b m e t p e S\n9 3 3 , 4 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 3 3\n,\n4 1\ne m o c n\ni\nt s e r e t n\ni\nt e N\n9 1 1\n) 7 (\n\n\n\n\n\n) 7 (\n\n6 2 1\ns s e n s u b e c n a r u s n\ni\nm o r f e m o c n\ni\nt e N\n1 7 5 , 4\n1 5 2\n\n1\n) 3 (\n) 6 2 (\n4 6 1\n5 1 1\n\n0 2 3\n,\n4\nr e h t O\n0 9 6 , 4\n4 4 2\n\n1\n) 3 (\n) 6 2 (\n4 6 1\n8 0 1\n\n6 4 4\n,\n4\ne m o c n\ni\ng n i t a r e p o r e h t O\n9 2 0 , 9 1\n4 4 2\n\n1\n) 3 (\n) 6 2 (\n4 6 1\n8 0 1\n\n5 8 7\n,\n8 1\ne m o c n\ni\ng n i t a r e p O\n) 1 7 0 , 9 (\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n) 1 7 0\n,\n9 (\ns e s n e p x e\ng n i t a r e p O\n8 5 9 , 9\n4 4 2\n\n1\n) 3 (\n) 6 2 (\n4 6 1\n8 0 1\n\n4 1 7\n,\n9\nx a t\nd n a\nt n e m\nr i a p m\nt i d e r c\ne r o f e b\nt i f o r\nP\n) 5 9 7 (\n) 1 (\n\n) 1 (\n\n\n\n\n\n) 4 9 7 (\ne g r a h c\nt n e m\nr i a p m\ni\nt i d e r C\n3 6 1 , 9\n3 4 2\n\n\n) 3 (\n) 6 2 (\n4 6 1\n8 0 1\n\n0 2 9\n,\n8\nx a t\ne m o c n\ni e r o f e b t i f o r P\n) 8 7 6 , 2 (\n) 9 6 (\n\n\n1\n7\n) 6 4 (\n) 1 3 (\n\n) 9 0 6\n,\n2 (\ne s n e p x e x a t e m o c n I\n) 5 1 (\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n) 5 1 (\ns t s e r e t n\ng n\ni l l\no r t n o c -

Basis of preparation\nThese Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements:\n\nhave been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of Australian Accounting Standards (AASs);\n\nshould be read in conjunction with ANZ’s Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 30 September 2019 (when released) and any public announcements made by the Parent Entity and its controlled entities (the Group) for the full year ended 30 September 2019 in accordance with the continuous disclosure obligations under the Corporations Act 2001 and the ASX Listing Rules;\n\ndo not include all notes of the type normally included in ANZ’s Annual Financial Report;\n\nare presented in Australian dollars unless otherwise stated; and\nwere approved by the Board of Directors on 30 October 2019.\ni) Accounting policies\nThese Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies and using methods of computation consistent with those applied in the 2018 ANZ Annual Financial Report with the exception of policies associated with new standards adopted during the period as discussed below.\nDiscontinued operations are separately presented from the results of the continuing operations as a single line item ‘profit/(loss) after tax from discontinued operations’ in the Condensed Consolidated Income Statement. Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Income Statement have been presented on a continuing basis. Assets and liabilities of discontinued operations have been presented as held for sale in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 30 September 2019.\nAccounting standards adopted during the period\nAASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9)\nThe Group has applied AASB 9 effective from 1 October 2018 (with the exception of the ‘own credit’ requirements relating to financial liabilities designated as measured at fair value, which were early adopted by the Group effective from 1 October 2013). In addition the Group chose to early adopt AASB 2017-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (AASB 2017-6) effective from 1 October 2018.\nAASB 9 and AASB 2017-6 stipulate new requirements for the impairment of financial assets, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and general hedge accounting. Details of the key new requirements are outlined below, and a reconciliation of the transitional impact at 1 October 2018 is set out in Note 16.\nImpairment\nAASB 9 introduces a new impairment model based on expected credit losses (ECL). This model is applied to:\nFinancial assets measured at amortised cost;\nDebt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI);\n\nLease receivables; and\n\nLoan commitments and financial guarantees not measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).\nExpected credit loss impairment model\nThe measurement of expected credit losses reflects an unbiased, probability weighted prediction which evaluates a range of scenarios and takes into account the time value of money, past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.\nExpected credit losses are either measured over 12 months or the expected lifetime of the financial asset, depending on credit deterioration since origination, according to the following three-stage approach:\nStage 1: At the origination of a financial asset, and where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, an allowance\nequivalent to 12 months ECL is recognised reflecting the expected credit losses resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months from the reporting date. For instruments with a remaining maturity of less than 12 months, expected credit losses are estimated based on default events that are possible over the remaining time to maturity.\nStage 2: Where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised reflecting expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. If credit risk were to improve in a subsequent period such that the increase in credit risk since origination is no longer considered significant, the exposure returns to a Stage 1 classification and a 12 month ECL applies.\nStage 3: Where there is objective evidence of impairment, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised.\nExpected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for exposures in Stage 1 and Stage 2, and on either a collective or individual basis when transferred to Stage 3.\nSignificant increase in credit risk (SICR)\nStage 2 assets are those that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination. In determining what constitutes a SICR, the Group considers both qualitative and quantitative information:\ni.\nInternal credit rating grade\nFor the majority of portfolios, the primary indicator of a SICR is a significant deterioration in the internal credit rating grade of a facility since origination and is measured by application of thresholds.\nFor non-retail portfolios, a SICR is determined by comparing the Customer Credit Rating (CCR) applicable to a facility at reporting date to the CCR at origination of that facility. A CCR is assigned to each borrower which reflects the probability of default of the borrower and incorporates both borrower\n89\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nand non-borrower specific information, including forward looking information. CCRs are subject to review at least annually or more frequently when an event occurs which could affect the credit risk of the customer.\nFor retail portfolios, a SICR is determined by comparing each facility’s scenario weighted lifetime probability of default at the reporting date to the scenario weighted lifetime probability of default at origination. The scenario weighted lifetime probability of default may increase significantly if:\n\nthere has been a deterioration in the economic outlook, or an increase in economic uncertainty; or\n\nthere has been a deterioration in the customer’s overall credit position, or ability to manage their credit obligations.\nii. Backstop criteria\nThe Group uses 30 days past due arrears as a backstop criteria for both non-retail and retail portfolios. For retail portfolios only, facilities are required to demonstrate three to six months of good payment behaviour prior to returning to Stage 1.\nMeasurement of expected credit loss\nECL is calculated as the product of the following credit risk factors at a facility level, discounted to incorporate the time value of money:\nExposure at default (EAD) - the expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and interest, expected\nadditional drawdowns and accrued interest;\nProbability of default (PD) - the estimate of the likelihood that a borrower will default over a given period; and\n\nLoss given default (LGD) - the expected loss in the event of the borrower defaulting, expressed as a percentage of the facility's EAD, taking into account direct and indirect recovery costs.\nThese credit risk factors are adjusted for current and forward looking information through the use of macro-economic variables.\nForward looking information\nIn applying forward looking information for estimating ECL, the Group considers four probability-weighted forecast economic scenarios as follows:\n(i) Base case scenario\nThe base case scenario is ANZ’s view of the most likely future macro-economic conditions. It reflects management’s assumptions used for strategic planning and budgeting, and also informs the Group Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) which is the process the Group applies in its strategic and capital planning over a 3 year time horizon;\n(ii) Upside and (iii) Downside scenarios\nThe upside and downside scenarios are fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions (that is, they are not based on the economic conditions prevailing at balance date) and are based on a combination of more optimistic (in the case of the upside) and pessimistic (in the case of the downside) economic events and uncertainty over long term horizons; and\n(iv) Severe downside scenario\nThe severe downside scenario is fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions and accounts for the potentially severe impact of less likely extremely adverse economic conditions. It reflects macro-economic conditions of a downturn economic event with a probability of occurrence once in every 25 years.\nThe four scenarios are described in terms of macro-economic variables used in the PD, LGD and EAD models (collectively the ECL models) depending on the portfolio and country of the borrower. Examples of the variables include unemployment rates, GDP growth rates, house price indices, commercial property price indices and consumer price indices.\nProbability weighting each scenario is determined by management by considering risks and uncertainties surrounding the base case scenario, as well as specific portfolio considerations where required. The Group’s Credit and Market Risk Committee (CMRC) is responsible for reviewing and approving forecast economic scenarios and the associated probability weights applied to each scenario.\nWhere applicable, adjustments may be made to account for situations where known or expected risks have not been adequately addressed in the modelling process. CMRC is responsible for approving such adjustments.\nExpected Life\nWhen estimating ECL for exposures in Stage 2 and 3, the Group considers the expected lifetime over which it is exposed to credit risk.\nFor non-retail portfolios, the Group uses the maximum contractual period as the expected lifetime for non-revolving credit facilities. For non-retail revolving credit facilities, such as corporate lines of credit, the expected life reflects the Group’s contractual right to withdraw a facility as part of a contractually agreed annual review, after taking into account the applicable notice period.\nFor retail portfolios, the expected lifetime is determined using behavioural term, taking into account expected prepayment behaviour and substantial modifications.\nDefinition of default, credit impaired and write-offs\nThe definition of default used in measuring expected credit losses is aligned to the definition used for internal credit risk management purposes across all portfolios. This definition is also in line with the regulatory definition of default. Default occurs when there are indicators that a debtor is unlikely to fully satisfy contractual credit obligations to the Group, or the exposure is 90 days past due.\nFinancial assets, including those that are well secured, are considered credit impaired for financial reporting purposes when they default.\nWhen there is no realistic probability of recovery, loans are written off against the related impairment allowance on completion of the Group’s internal processes and when all reasonably expected recoveries have been collected. In subsequent periods, any recoveries of amounts previously written-off are credited to the credit impairment charge in the income statement.\nModified financial assets\nIf the terms of a financial asset are modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one for either credit or commercial reasons, an assessment is made to determine if the changes to the terms of the existing financial asset are considered substantial. This assessment considers both\n90\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nchanges in cash flows arising from the modified terms as well as changes in the overall instrument risk profile; for example, changes in the principal (credit limit), term, or type of underlying collateral. Where a modification is considered non-substantial, the existing financial asset is not derecognised and its date of origination continues to be used to determine SICR. Where a modification is considered substantial, the existing financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at its fair value on the modification date, which also becomes the date of origination used to determine SICR for this new asset.\nClassification and measurement\nFinancial assets - general\nThere are three measurement classifications for financial assets under AASB 9: amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Financial assets are classified into these measurement classifications on the basis of two criteria:\n\nthe business model within which the financial asset is managed; and\n\nthe contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset (specifically whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest).\nThe resultant financial asset classifications are as follows:\nAmortised cost: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest only and which are held in a\nbusiness model whose objective is to collect their cash flows;\nFVOCI: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest only and which are held in a business\nmodel whose objective is to collect their cash flows or to sell; and\nFVTPL: Any other financial assets not falling into the categories above are measured at FVTPL.\nFair Value Option for Financial Assets\nA financial asset may be irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition when the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\nFinancial assets - equity instruments\nNon-traded equity investments may be designated at FVOCI on an instrument by instrument basis. If this election is made, gains or losses are not reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss on disposal of the investment. However, gains or losses may be reclassified within equity.\nFinancial liabilities\nThe classification and measurement requirements for financial liabilities under AASB 9 are largely consistent with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (AASB 139) with the exception that for financial liabilities designated as measured at fair value, gains or losses relating to changes in the entity’s own credit risk are included in other comprehensive income, except where doing so would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. This part of the standard was early adopted by the Group on 1 October 2013.\nFinancial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, or fair value through profit or loss when they are held for trading. Additionally, financial liabilities can be designated at FVTPL where:\nThe designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch which would otherwise arise; or\nA group of financial liabilities are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk\nmanagement strategy; or\nThe financial liability contains one or more embedded derivatives unless:\na) the embedded derivative does not significantly modify the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract, or\nb) the embedded derivative is closely related to the host financial liability.\nGeneral hedge accounting\nAASB 9 introduces new hedge accounting requirements which more closely align accounting with risk management activities undertaken when hedging financial and non-financial risks. The Group has exercised an accounting policy choice to continue to apply the AASB 139 hedge accounting requirements until the International Accounting Standards Board’s ongoing Dynamic Risk Management (macro hedging) project is completed.\nAASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (AASB 15)\nThe Group adopted AASB 15 from 1 October 2018 which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to amounts recognised in the full year condensed consolidated financial statements. The standard requires identification of distinct performance obligations within a contract, and allocation of the transaction price of the contract to those performance obligations. Revenue is then recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied. The standard also provides guidance on whether an entity is acting as a principal or an agent which impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis. In accordance with the transitional provisions of AASB 15, the Group has adopted the full retrospective transition approach whereby the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard has been recognised as an adjustment to opening retained earnings as at 1 October 2017 and comparative information for the 2018 reporting period has been restated.\nThe adoption of AASB 15 resulted in the following accounting changes:\ni) Recognition of trail commission revenue: trail commission revenue previously recognised over time is now recognised at the time the Group initially\ndistributes the underlying product to the customer where it is highly probable the revenue will not need to be reversed in future periods.\nThis policy change resulted in an increase to the opening balances of Other assets of $32 million, Deferred tax liabilities of $10 million and Retained earnings of $22 million as at 1 October 2017 to recognise revenue that qualifies for upfront recognition under AASB 15 but was not previously recognised under AASB 118 Revenue (AASB 118). The change did not impact net profit or earnings per share in the comparative period.\nii) Presentation: Certain credit card loyalty costs and other costs will be presented as operating expenses where the Group has assessed that it is\nacting as principal (rather than an agent). Previously these costs were presented as a reduction in other operating income. In addition, certain\n91\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nincentives received from card scheme providers related to card marketing activities will be presented as Operating income where the Group has assessed that it is acting as principal (rather than an agent). Previously these incentives were presented as a reduction in Operating expenses.\nThe presentation of these costs under AASB 15 increased other operating income and operating expenses equally by $91 million and $62 million in the comparative periods ending 30 September 2018 and 31 March 2018 respectively. The changes did not impact net profit or earnings per share in the comparative periods.\nA minor balance sheet reclassification associated with credit card loyalty programs is set out in Note 16.\nii) Basis of measurement\nThe financial information has been prepared in accordance with the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value:\n\nderivative financial instruments as well as, in the case of fair value hedges, the fair value adjustment on the underlying hedged exposure;\n\nfinancial assets and liabilities held for trading;\n\nfinancial assets and liabilities designed at fair value through profit and loss;\n\navailable-for-sale financial assets (applicable prior to 1 October 2018);\n\nfinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (applicable from 1 October 2018);\n\nassets and liabilities held for sale (except those at carrying value as per Note 10).\nIn accordance with AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts, life insurance liabilities are measured using the Margin on Services model.\nIn accordance with AASB 119 Employee Benefits, defined benefit obligations are measured using the Projected Unit Credit method.\niii) Use of estimates, assumptions and judgements\nThe preparation of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires the use of management judgement, estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and the application of accounting policies. Discussion of the critical accounting estimates and judgements, which include complex or subjective decisions or assessments are provided in Note 1 of the 2019 ANZ Annual Financial Report – (when released). Such estimates and judgements are reviewed on an ongoing basis.\nInvestments in associates\nAt 30 September 2019, the impairment assessment of non-lending assets identified that two of the Group’s associate investments AMMB Holdings Berhad (AmBank) and PT Bank Pan Indonesia (PT Panin) had indicators of impairment. Although their market value (based on share price) was below their carrying value, no impairment was recognised as their carrying values are supported by their value in use (VIU) calculations.\nThe VIU calculations are sensitive to a number of key assumptions, including discount rates, long term growth rates, future profitability and capital levels. A change in key assumptions could have an adverse impact on the recoverable amount of the investment. The key assumptions used in the VIU calculations are outlined below:\nAs at 30 Sep 19\nCarrying value supported by VIU calculation ($m)\nAmBank 1,586\nPost-tax discount rate\n10.7%\nTerminal growth rate\n4.8%\nExpected NPAT growth (compound annual growth rate - 5 years)\n4.1%\nCore equity tier 1 ratio\n11.9% to 12.7%\nInvestment securities (comparative information shown in available-for-sale assets)\nAs a result of persistent illiquidity of the quoted share price of Bank of Tianjin (BoT), the Group determines the fair value based on a valuation model using comparable bank pricing multiples. Judgement is required in both the selection of the model and inputs used.\nCustomer remediation provision\nAt 30 September 2019, the Group has recognised provisions of $1,139 million (Mar 19: $698 million; Sep 18: $602 million) in respect of customer remediation which includes provisions for expected refunds to customers, remediation project costs and costs associated and related customer and regulatory claims, penalties and litigation outcomes.\nDetermining the amount of the provisions, which represent management’s best estimate of the cost of settling the identified matters, requires the exercise of significant judgement. It will often be necessary to form a view on a number of different assumptions, including the number of impacted customers, the average refund per customer, associated remediation project costs, and the implications of regulatory exposures and customer claims having regard to their specific facts and circumstances.\nConsequently, the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions is reviewed on a regular basis against actual experience and other relevant evidence including expert legal advice, and adjustments are made to the provisions where appropriate.\nAssets and liabilities held for sale\nWhen classifying assets and liabilities as held for sale, judgement is required when assessing whether it is highly probable that contracted sales will complete within 12 months after balance date, particularly when the sale is subject to third party approvals. Management regularly reviews the status of each sale transaction to ensure the classification remains appropriate.\nManagement is required to exercise significant judgement when assessing the fair value less costs to sell for assets and liabilities held for sale. The judgemental factors include determining: costs to sell, allocation of goodwill, indemnities provided under the sale contract and consideration received - particularly where elements of consideration are contingent in nature. Any impairment we record is based on the best available evidence of fair value compared to the carrying value before the impairment. The final sale price may be different to the fair value we estimate when recording the impairment.\n92\nPT Panin 1,350\n13.3%\n5.3%\n6.5%\n11.6%\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nManagement regularly assess the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions against actual outcomes and other relevant evidence and adjustments are made to fair value where appropriate.\nUseful lives of software\nManagement judgement is used to assess the useful life of software assets. A number of factors can influence the useful lives of software assets, including changes to business strategy, significant divestments and the pace of technological change.\nThe Group reassess the useful lives of software assets on a semi-annual basis. During the September 2018 full year, certain software assets in the Institutional and Australia Retail and Commercial divisions had their useful life reassessed.\niv) Rounding of amounts\nThe amounts contained in these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been rounded to the nearest million dollars, except where otherwise indicated, as permitted by Australian Securities and Investments Commission Corporations Instrument 2016/191.\nv) Future accounting developments\nAASB 9 - General hedge accounting\nAASB 9 introduces new hedge accounting requirements which more closely align accounting with risk management activities undertaken when hedging financial and non-financial risks.\nAASB 9 provides the Group with an accounting policy choice to continue to apply AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (AASB 139) hedge accounting requirements until the International Accounting Standards Board’s ongoing project on macro hedge accounting is completed. The Group currently applies the hedge accounting requirements of AASB 139.\nAASB 16 Leases (AASB 16)\nAASB 16 is effective for the Group from 1 October 2019 and replaces the previous standard AASB 117 Leases (AASB 117). AASB 16 primarily impacts the Group’s property and technology leases which were previously classified as operating leases. Under AASB 117, operating leases were not recognised on balance sheet and rent payments were expensed over the lease term.\nUnder AASB 16, lessees must recognise all leases (except for leases of low value assets and short term leases) on balance sheet under a single accounting model. Accordingly, the Group will recognise its right to use an underlying leased asset over the lease term as a right-of-use (ROU) asset, and its obligation to make lease payments as a lease liability. In the income statement, the Group will recognise depreciation expense on the ROU asset and interest expense on the lease liability. As a result, lease expenses will be higher in the early periods of a lease and lower in the later periods of the lease compared to the previous standard where expenses were constant over the lease term. Cumulative expenses over the life of a lease will not change.\nThe Group will apply the modified retrospective transition approach whereby initial lease liabilities are recognised based on the present value of remaining lease payments as of the transition date. The initial ROU asset recognised for certain large commercial and retail leases will be measured as if AASB 16 had always been applied to the leases. For all other leases, the initial ROU asset will be measured as equal to the initial lease liability. Based on this transition approach, the Group expects to recognise an increase in liabilities of $1.7 billion and an increase in assets of $1.6 billion. This is expected to result in a reduction to opening retained earnings of $82 million and an increase in deferred tax assets of $43 million as of 1 October 2019. Comparative information from prior periods will not be restated.\nThe implementation of AASB 16 requires management to make certain key judgements including the determination of lease terms, discount rates and identifying arrangements that contain a lease. These estimates may be refined as the Group finalises its implementation of the standard in the first half of the 2020 financial year.\nInterest Rate Benchmark Reform\nInterbank offered rates (IBORs), such as LIBOR, are a key reference rate for derivatives, loans and securities for global financial markets. In response to concerns about the transparency and liquidity of IBOR rates, regulators in a number of jurisdictions across the globe are well advanced in developing benchmark rates to phase out and replace IBORs, these projects are collectively known as ‘IBOR Reform’. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is also considering the financial reporting implications of IBOR reform which is expected to impact elements of financial instrument accounting, including hedge accounting, loan modifications, fair value methodologies and disclosures.\nThe IASB project is split into two phases: Phase 1 deals with pre-replacement issues (issues affecting financial reporting in the period before the replacement of IBOR’s); and Phase 2 deals with replacement issues (issues affecting financial reporting when existing IBOR’s are replaced).\nIn September 2019, the IASB issued a final standard, Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 which focuses on ‘pre-rate replacement issues’ and provides exceptions to specific hedge accounting requirements under IAS 39 and IFRS 9 so that entities will be able to apply those hedge accounting requirements under an assumption that the interest rate benchmark is not altered as a result of the interest rate benchmark reform. In October 2019, AASB adopted these amendments in AASB 2019-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform.\nAlthough the Group anticipates the new standard, once adopted, will provide certain relief in relation to hedge accounting requirements, for 30 September 2019 reporting purposes, it has considered the existing portfolio of hedge accounted relationships in light of:\n\nthe significant uncertainty surrounding the method and timing of transition away from IBORs; and\n\nongoing application and reliance in capital markets on IBOR’s for financial instrument pricing.\nAs result of the above factors, the Group has concluded that continuation of hedge accounting relationships for potentially impacted hedge relationship remains appropriate.\nThe Group is considering the new standard which is effective on 1 October 2020 but may be adopted earlier.\n93\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2.

Discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale\ni)\nDiscontinued operations\nOn 17 October 2017, the Group announced it had agreed to sell its OnePath P&I business and ADGs businesses to IOOF. The sale of the ADGs business completed on 1 October 2018. On 17 October 2019, the Group announced it had agreed a revised sale price for its OnePath P&I business and ADGs to IOOF of $850 million, being a $125 million reduction from the original sale price of $975 million announced in October 2017. The new price of $850 million includes approximately $25 million that ANZ has already received for the sale of ADGs in October 2018. The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements. Subject to APRA approval, the Group expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. The impact of the reduction in price has been reflected in the 2019 financial results.\nOn 12 December 2017, ANZ announced that it had agreed to the sale of its life insurance business to Zurich Financial Services Australia (Zurich) and regulatory approval was obtained on 10 October 2018.

Changes in composition of the Group\nThe following changes to material entities of the Group have occurred during the year ended 30 September 2019:\n\nIn September 2018, the business of Share Investing Limited was sold to CMC Markets Stockbroking Limited. Share Investing Limited and its immediate parent company, ACN 003 042 082 Limited, are no longer considered to be material entities.\n\nIn November 2018, OnePath Life (NZ) Limited was sold to Cigna Corporation and the business of ANZ Europe Limited (formerly ANZ Bank (Europe) Limited) was wound up.

Contingent liabilities and contingent assets\nThere are outstanding court proceedings, claims and possible claims for and against the Group. Where relevant, expert legal advice has been obtained and, in the light of such advice, provisions and/or disclosures as deemed appropriate have been made (Note 21 of the 2019 Annual Financial Report (when released) will contain a description of provisions held). In some instances we have not disclosed the estimated financial impact of the individual items either because it is not practicable to do so or because such disclosure may prejudice the interests of the Group.\nNote 33 of the 2019 ANZ Annual Financial Report (when released) will contain a description of contingent liabilities and contingent assets as at 30 September 2019. A summary of some of those contingent liabilities is set out below.\nRegulatory and customer exposures\nIn recent years there has been an increase in the number of matters on which the Group engages with its regulators. There have also been significant increases in the nature and scale of regulatory investigations and reviews, civil and criminal enforcement actions (whether by court action or otherwise), formal and informal inquiries, regulatory supervisory activities and the quantum of fines issued by regulators, particularly against financial institutions both in Australia and globally. The Group has received various notices and requests for information from its regulators as part of both industry-wide and Group-specific reviews and has also made disclosures to its regulators at its own instigation. The nature of these interactions can be wide ranging and, for example, currently include a range of matters including responsible lending practices, product suitability and distribution, interest and fees and the entitlement to charge them, customer remediation, wealth advice, insurance distribution, pricing, competition, conduct in financial markets and financial transactions, capital market transactions, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations, reporting and disclosure obligations and product disclosure documentation. There may be exposures to customers which are additional to any regulatory exposures. These could include class actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities. The outcomes and total costs associated with such reviews and possible exposures remain uncertain.\nBank fees litigation and periodical payment remediation and ASIC action\nA litigation funder commenced a class action against the Company in 2010, followed by a second similar class action in March 2013. The applicants contended that certain exception fees (honour, dishonour and non-payment fees on transaction accounts and late payment and over-limit fees on credit cards) were unenforceable penalties and that various of the fees were also unenforceable under statutory provisions governing unconscionable conduct, unfair contract terms and unjust transactions. The claims in the March 2013 class action failed and have been dismissed.\nThe original claims in the 2010 class action have been dismissed. In 2017, a new claim was added to the 2010 class action, in relation to the Company’s entitlement to charge certain periodical payment non-payment fees. Part of the class of customers had already received remediation payments from the Company. An agreement to settle the claim was reached in December 2018. The settlement is subject to court approval.\nIn July 2019, ASIC commenced civil penalty proceedings against the Company in relation to the charging of fees for periodical payments in certain circumstances between August 2003 and February 2016. ASIC seeks civil penalties in respect of alleged false or misleading representations and unconscionable conduct. ASIC also alleges that the Company engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct and breached certain statutory obligations as a financial services licensee. The matter is at an early stage. The outcomes and total costs remain uncertain. The Company is defending the allegations.\nBenchmark/rate actions\nIn July and August 2016, class action complaints were brought in the United States District Court against local and international banks, including the Company – one action relating to the bank bill swap rate (BBSW), and one action relating to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR) and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate (SOR). The class actions are expressed to apply to persons and entities that engaged in US-based transactions in financial instruments that were priced, benchmarked, and/or settled based on BBSW or SIBOR. The claimants seek damages or compensation in amounts not specified, and allege that the defendant banks, including the Company, violated US anti-trust laws and (in the BBSW case only) anti- racketeering laws, the Commodity Exchange Act, and unjust enrichment principles. The Company is defending the proceedings. The matters are at an early stage.\nIn February 2017, the South African Competition Commission commenced proceedings against local and international banks including the Company alleging breaches of the cartel provisions of the South African Competition Act in respect of trading in the South African rand. The potential civil penalty or other financial impact is uncertain. The matter is at an early stage.\n108\nMovt 43%\nSep 18 % 39\n24\nn/a\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n Capital raising actions\nIn June 2018, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions commenced criminal proceedings against the Company and a senior employee alleging that they were knowingly concerned in cartel conduct by the joint lead managers of the Company’s August 2015 underwritten institutional equity placement of approximately 80.8 million ordinary shares. The matter is at an early stage. The Company and its senior employee are defending the allegations.\nIn September 2018, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) commenced civil penalty proceedings against the Company alleging failure to comply with continuous disclosure obligations in connection with the Company’s August 2015 underwritten institutional equity placement. ASIC alleges the Company should have advised the market that the joint lead managers took up approximately 25.5 million ordinary shares of the placement. The matter is at an early stage. The Company is defending the allegations.\nFranchisee litigation\nIn February 2018, two related class actions were brought against the Company alleging breaches of contract and unconscionable conduct in relation to lending to 7-Eleven franchisees. An agreement to settle the claims against the Company was reached in March 2019. The settlement is subject to court approval.\nRoyal Commission\nThe Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry released its final report on 4 February 2019. The findings and recommendations of the Commission are resulting in additional costs and may lead to further exposures, including exposures associated with further regulator activity or potential customer exposures such as class actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities. The outcomes and total costs associated with these possible exposures remain uncertain.\nSecurity recovery actions\nVarious claims have been made or are anticipated, arising from security recovery actions taken to resolve impaired assets. These claims will be defended.\nWarranties and Indemnities\nThe Group has provided warranties, indemnities and other commitments in favour of the purchaser and other persons in connection with various disposals of businesses and assets and other transactions, covering a range of matters and risks. It is exposed to potential claims under those warranties, indemnities and commitments.\n15. Significant Events Since the End of the Financial Year\nOn 17 October, the Group announced it had agreed a revised sale price for its OnePath P&I business and ADGs to IOOF of $850 million, being a $125 million reduction from the original sale price of $975 million announced in October 2017. The new price of $850 million includes approximately $25 million that ANZ has already received for the sale of ADGs in October 2018. The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements. Subject to APRA approval, the Group expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. The impact of the reduction in price has been reflected in the 2019 financial results.\nOther than the matter above, there have been no significant events from 30 September 2019 to the date of signing this report.\n109\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n16.

The Group adopted AASB 15 in this reporting period with comparatives restated. The impact of this policy change on the reported 30 September 2018 balance sheet was an increase in Other assets of $32 million, an increase in Deferred tax liabilities of $10 million and an increase in Retained earnings of $22 million, reflecting revenue that qualifies for upfront recognition under AASB 15 but was not previously recognised under AASB 118.\n3. Upon adoption of AASB 15, certain liabilities associated with credit card loyalty programs have been reclassified from Provisions to Payables and other liabilities.\nIn addition to the balance sheet impact above, upon adoption of AASB 15 certain items previously netted are now presented gross in operating income and operating expenses. This increased total operating income and total operating expenses by $128 million for the 2019 financial year. Comparative information has been restated which increased total operating income and total operating expenses by $153 million for the 2018 financial year.\n110\nRestated as at 30 Sep 18 $M\n604,464\n3,677\n335,041\n943,182\n69\n6,894\n1,998\n874,816\n883,777\n31,737\n27,528\n59,265\n140\n59,405\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nii)\nImpact of the transition to AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9)\nAllowance for expected credit losses\nThe table below reconciles the closing provisions for credit impairment of financial assets determined in accordance with AASB 139, and provisions for credit impairment of loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts determined in accordance with AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets as at 30 September 2018, and the allowance for expected credit losses determined in accordance with AASB 9 as at 1 October 2018.\nAs at 30 Sep 18 Provision for credit impairment under AASB 139 or AASB 137 $M\nIncremental allowance for ECL under AASB 9 $M\nAs at 1 Oct 18\nAllowance for ECL under AASB 9 $M\nLoans and advances - at amortised cost\n2,917\n647\n3,564\nInvestment securities - debt securities at amortised cost\n\n11\n11\nOff-balance sheet commitments - undrawn and contingent facilities1\n526\n155\n681\nTotal provisions for credit impairment\n3,443\n813\n4,256\nLoss allowances recognised in other comprehensive income:\nInvestment securities - debt securities at FVOCI2\n\n14\n14\nTotal loss allowance recognised in other comprehensive income\n\n14\n14\n1.

While neutral at a Group level, this change impacted net interest income at the business unit level and comparative information was restated accordingly.\n124\nSep 18 %\n4.47\n2.26\n4.45\n3.91\nSep 18 %\n1.90\n0.30\n2.20\n0.64\n0.09\n0.73\n1.83\n0.33\n2.16\n1.63\n0.24\n1.87\n2.55\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nSelect geographical disclosures – including discontinued operations\nThe following divisions operate across the geographic locations illustrated below: • • Pacific division - International • New Zealand division - New Zealand\nInstitutional division - International, New Zealand and Australia\nThe International geography includes Asia, Pacific, Europe & America\nAustralia $M\nNew Zealand $M\nInternational $M\nSeptember 2019 Full Year Statutory profit attributable to shareholders of the company\n3,259\n1,723\n971\nCash profit\n3,331\n1,865\n965\nNet loans and advances1\n429,454\n123,467\n62,337\nCustomer deposits1\n283,586\n101,205\n127,021\nRisk weighted assets1\n259,820\n78,613\n78,528\nSeptember 2018 Full Year Statutory profit attributable to shareholders of the company\n3,874\n1,819\n707\nCash profit\n3,387\n1,745\n673\nNet loans and advances1\n427,115\n117,935\n60,413\nCustomer deposits1\n276,769\n95,310\n115,194\nRisk weighted assets1\n248,504\n67,627\n74,689\nSeptember 2019 Half Year Statutory profit attributable to shareholders of the company\n1,509\n846\n425\nCash profit\n1,429\n813\n405\nNet loans and advances1\n429,454\n123,467\n62,337\nCustomer deposits1\n283,586\n101,205\n127,021\nRisk weighted assets1\n259,820\n78,613\n78,528\nMarch 2019 Half Year Statutory profit attributable to shareholders of the company\n1,750\n877\n546\nCash profit\n1,902\n1,052\n560\nNet loans and advances1\n421,279\n126,287\n62,603\nCustomer deposits1\n270,779\n103,034\n119,560\nRisk weighted assets1\n249,777\n71,322\n75,192\n1.

The term “AASB” is commonly used when identifying Australian Accounting Standards issued by the AASB.\nAPRA - Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.\nAPS - ADI Prudential Standard.\nCash and cash equivalents comprise coins, notes, money at call, balances held with central banks, liquid settlement balances (readily convertible to known amounts of cash which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value) and securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repos) in less than three months.\nCash profit is an additional measure of profit which is prepared on a basis other than in accordance with accounting standards. Cash profit represents ANZ’s preferred measure of the result of the core business activities of the Group, enabling readers to assess Group and Divisional performance against prior periods and against peer institutions. To calculate cash profit, the Group excludes non-core items from statutory profit as noted below. These items are calculated consistently period on period so as not to discriminate between positive and negative adjustments.\nGains and losses are adjusted where they are significant, or have the potential to be significant in any one period, and fall into one of three categories:\n1.\ngains or losses included in earnings arising from changes in tax, legal or accounting legislation or other non-core items not associated with the core operations of the Group;\n2.\ntreasury shares, revaluation of policy liabilities, economic hedging impacts and similar accounting items that represent timing differences that will reverse through earnings in the future; and\n3.\naccounting reclassifications between individual line items that do not impact reported results, such as policyholders tax gross up.\nCash profit is not a measure of cash flow or profit determined on a cash accounting basis.\nCollectively assessed provision under AASB 139 is the provision for credit losses that are inherent in the portfolio but not able to be individually identified. A collectively assessed provision may only be recognised when a loss event has already occurred. Losses expected as a result of future events, no matter how likely, are not recognised.\nCollectively assessed allowance for expected credit loss under AASB 9 represents the Expected Credit Loss (ECL). This incorporates forward looking information and does not require an actual loss event to have occurred for an impairment provision to be recognised.\nCovered bonds are bonds issued by an ADI to external investors secured against a pool of the ADI’s assets (the cover pool) assigned to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. The primary assets forming the cover pool are mortgage loans. The mortgages remain on the issuer’s balance sheet. The covered bond holders have dual recourse to the issuer and the cover pool assets. The mortgages included in the cover pool cannot be otherwise pledged or disposed of but may be repurchased and substituted in order to maintain the credit quality of the pool. The Group issues covered bonds as part of its funding activities.\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from the failure of ANZ’s customers and counterparties to honour or perform fully the terms of a loan or contract.\nCredit risk weighted assets (CRWA) represent assets which are weighted for credit risk according to a set formula as prescribed in APS 112/113.\nCustomer deposits represent term deposits, other deposits bearing interest, deposits not bearing interest and borrowing corporations’ debt excluding securitisation deposits.\nCustomer remediation includes provisions for expected refunds to customers, remediation project costs and related customer and regulatory claims, penalties and litigation outcomes.\nDerivative credit valuation adjustment (CVA) - Over the life of a derivative instrument, ANZ uses a model to adjust fair value to take into account the impact of counterparty credit quality. The methodology calculates the present value of expected losses over the life of the financial instrument as a function of probability of default, loss given default, expected credit risk exposure and an asset correlation factor. Impaired derivatives are also subject to a CVA.\nDividend payout ratio is the total ordinary dividend payment divided by profit attributable to shareholders of the Company.\nGross loans and advances (GLA) is made up of loans and advances, capitalised brokerage/mortgage origination fees less unearned income.\nImpaired assets are those financial assets where doubt exists as to whether the full contractual amount will be received in a timely manner, or where concessional terms have been provided because of the financial difficulties of the customer. Financial assets are impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of a loss event that occurred prior to the reporting date, and that loss event has had an impact, which can be reliably estimated, on the expected future cash flows of the individual asset or portfolio of assets.\nImpaired loans comprise drawn facilities where the customer’s status is defined as impaired.\nIndividually assessed allowance for expected credit losses is assessed on a case-by-case basis for all individually managed impaired assets taking into consideration factors such as the realisable value of security (or other credit mitigants), the likely return available upon liquidation or bankruptcy, legal uncertainties, estimated costs involved in recovery, the market price of the exposure in secondary markets and the amount and timing of expected receipts and recoveries.\nInterest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) relates to the potential adverse impact of changes in market interest rates on ANZ’s future net interest income. The risk generally arises from:\n1. Repricing and yield curve risk - the risk to earnings or market value as a result of changes in the overall level of interest rates and/or the relativity of these rates across the yield curve;\n2. Basis risk - the risk to earnings or market value arising from volatility in the interest margin applicable to banking book items; and\n3. Optionality risk - the risk to earnings or market value arising from the existence of stand-alone or embedded options in banking book items.\nInternationally comparable ratios are ANZ’s interpretation of the regulations documented in the Basel Committee publications: “Basel 3: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems” (June 2011) and “International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards” (June 2006). They also include differences identified in APRA’s information paper entitled International Capital Comparison Study (13 July 2015).\nLevel 1 in the context of APRA supervision, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited consolidated with certain approved subsidiaries.\nLevel 2 in the context of APRA supervision, the consolidated ANZ Group excluding associates, insurance and funds management entities, commercial non-financial entities and certain securitisation vehicles.\n128\nDEFINITIONS\nNet interest margin is net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets.\nNet loans and advances represent gross loans and advances less allowance for credit losses.\nNet Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is the ratio of the amount of available stable funding (ASF) to the amount of required stable funding (RSF) defined by APRA. The amount of ASF is the portion of an Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions (ADI) capital and liabilities expected to be a reliable source of funds over a one year time horizon. The amount of RSF is a function of the liquidity characteristics and residual maturities of an ADI’s assets and off-balance sheet activities. ADIs must maintain an NSFR of at least 100%.\nNet tangible assets equal share capital and reserves attributable to shareholders of the Company less unamortised intangible assets (including goodwill and software).\nRegulatory deposits are mandatory reserve deposits lodged with local central banks in accordance with statutory requirements.\nRestructured items comprise facilities in which the original contractual terms have been modified for reasons related to the financial difficulties of the customer. Restructuring may consist of reduction of interest, principal or other payments legally due, or an extension in maturity materially beyond those typically offered to new facilities with similar risk.\nReturn on average assets is the profit attributable to shareholders of the Company, divided by average total assets.\nReturn on average ordinary shareholders’ equity is the profit attributable to shareholders of the Company, divided by average ordinary shareholders’ equity.\nRisk weighted assets (RWA) are risk weighted according to each asset’s inherent potential for default and what the likely losses would be in the case of default. In the case of non asset backed risks (i.e. market and operational risk), RWA is determined by multiplying the capital requirements for those risks by 12.5.\nSettlement balances owed to/by ANZ represent financial assets and/or liabilities which are in the course of being settled. These may include trade dated assets and liabilities, vostro accounts and securities settlement accounts.\n129\nDEFINITIONS\nDescription of divisions\nThe Group operates on a divisional structure with five continuing divisions: Australia Retail and Commercial, Institutional, New Zealand, Pacific, and TSO and Group Centre.\nThe following structural changes have taken place during the September 2019 financial year:\n\nThe residual Asia Retail and Wealth businesses have been transferred from the former Asia Retail and Pacific division to TSO and Group Centre division. The remaining segment has been renamed Pacific division; and\n\nANZ’s lenders mortgage insurance, share investing, general insurance distribution and financial planning businesses which were previously part of the continuing operations of Wealth Australia now form part of the Australia Retail and Commercial division (previously named Australia division) and Wealth Australia ceases to exist as a continuing division.\nAustralia Retail and Commercial\nAustralia Retail and Commercial division comprises of the following business units.\nRetail provides products and services to consumer customers in Australia via the branch network, mortgage specialists, contact centres and a variety\nof self-service channels (internet banking, phone banking, ATMs, website, ANZ share investing and digital banking) and third party brokers in addition to financial planning services provided by salaried financial planners.\nCommercial provides a full range of banking products and financial services, including asset financing, across the following customer segments:\nmedium to large commercial customers and agribusiness customers across regional Australia, small business owners and high net worth individuals and family groups.\nInstitutional\nThe Institutional division services global institutional and corporate customers across three product sets: Transaction Banking, Loans & Specialised Finance and Markets.\nTransaction Banking provides working capital and liquidity solutions including documentary trade, supply chain financing, commodity financing as\nwell as cash management solutions, deposits, payments and clearing.\nLoans & Specialised Finance provides loan products, loan syndication, specialised loan structuring and execution, project and export finance, debt\nstructuring and acquisition finance and corporate advisory.\nMarkets provide risk management services on foreign exchange, interest rates, credit, commodities and debt capital markets in addition to managing\nthe Group's interest rate exposure and liquidity position.\nNew Zealand\nThe New Zealand division comprises the Retail and Commercial business units.\nRetail provides a full range of banking and wealth management services to consumer, private banking and small business banking customers.

    "content": "31 OCTOBER 2019\nNEWS RELEASE ANZ FULL YEAR 2019 RESULT & PROPOSED FINAL DIVIDEND\nANZ today announced a Statutory Profit after tax for the Full Year ended 30 September 2019 of $5.95 billion, down 7% on the prior comparable period. Cash Profit1 for its continuing operations was $6.47 billion, flat with the prior comparable period. Cash Earnings per Share increased 2% to 228 cents.\nANZ’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was stable at 11.4% and around $3.5 billion above the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority’s (APRA) ‘unquestionably strong’ measure. Return on Equity decreased 10 bps to 10.9%.\nThe proposed Final Dividend is 80 cents per share, partially franked at 70%. This equates to $2.3 billion to be paid to shareholders against ANZ’s market capitalisation of $78 billion.\nGroup Financial Information\nEarnings ($m)\nFY19\nFY18 Movement\nStatutory Profit After Tax\n5,953\n6,400\n7%\nCash Profit (continuing basis)\n6,470\n6,487\n0%\nProfit before credit impairment & tax\n9,958\n9,966\n0%\nEarnings per share (cents)\n227.6\n223.4\n+2%\nReturn on equity\n10.9%\n11.0%\n10bps\nReturn on average assets\n0.68%\n0.72%\n4bps\nDividend per share (cents)\n160\n160\nFlat\nCredit Quality\nFY19\nFY18 Movement\nTotal credit impairment charge as a % of average GLAs\n0.13%\n0.12%\n+1bps\nNew impaired assets\n2,007\n2,108\n5%\nBalance Sheet ($b)\nFY19\nFY18 Movement\nGross Loans and Advances (GLAs)\n618.8\n608.4\n+2%\nTotal Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs)\n417.0\n390.8\n+7%\nCustomer Deposits\n511.8\n487.3\n+5%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Ratio (CET1)\n11.4%\n11.4%\nStable\nOther\nFY19\nFY18 Movement\nFull time equivalent staff (including discontinued)\n39,060\n39,924\n2%\n1 All financials are on a Cash Profit Continuing Basis with growth rates compared to the Full Year ended 30 September 2018 unless otherwise stated\nCEO COMMENTARY\nANZ Chief Executive Officer Shayne Elliott said: “This has been a challenging year of slow economic growth, increased competition, regulatory change and global uncertainty.\n“Despite the challenges, we maintained focus on improving customer experience, balance sheet strength and improving our culture and capability. In doing this, we significantly reduced the cost and risk of operating the bank even though strong headwinds impacted the sector. Investment was at record levels and we are a far stronger bank as a result of the progress made this year.\n“Retail & Commercial in Australia had a difficult year. Along with increased remediation charges, intense competition and record low interest rates have had a significant impact on earnings. While yet to flow through to the balance sheet, management actions and operational improvements have seen a steady recovery in home loan applications in recent months. This momentum is expected to be maintained into 2020.\n“The transformation of Institutional continued to provide prudent and diversified growth. While macro conditions had an impact on financial performance in the second half within Markets, the broader business is now generating returns above our cost of capital, providing important diversification given the lower growth in our home markets.\n“New Zealand delivered a solid underlying result in an increasingly competitive environment. Compliance and remediation costs contributed to higher operating expenses. This was mainly driven by the complex work required to comply with new regulatory standards that all subsidiary banks be able to operate as stand-alone entities.\n“In proposing the Final Dividend and franking level, the Board considered the bank’s strong capital position and its organic capital generation capacity. Our decision to reduce franking to a new base reflects the changed shape of our business as well as recognising how important the dividend, franking and predictability is to shareholders,” Mr Elliott said.\nHIGHLIGHTS\nBusiness initiatives  Operational improvements and a targeted marketing campaign resulted in a greater than 30% increase in average applications for Australian home loans in the most recent half.  Capital benefits of $2.7 billion through completed sales of OnePath Life to Zurich Financial Services Australia, a 55% stake in our Cambodian joint-venture to J-Trust, the retail and small business franchise in Papua New Guinea to Kina Bank, and OnePath Life (NZ) to Cigna Corporation.\n Migrated more than 60,000 users onto a new Institutional customer self-service platform, providing access to all transaction accounts, payments and foreign exchange in one place.  Investment spend increased $185m targeting improvements to customer experience and\norigination systems, along with meeting increased regulatory and compliance obligations.\n New ventures arm, ANZi, invested ~$65 million in emerging growth companies that can\nhelp create long-term strategic value.\nBuilding trust, leading with purpose2  Implemented industry leading reform to group-wide remuneration structure, replacing\nindividual bonuses for more than 80% of people with an incentive based on Group performance.3\n Contacted more than 1 million customers to help them get more value from products and services, including helping those receiving Centrelink or Veterans’ Affairs benefits move to low cost, basic bank accounts. Also contacted customers with persistent credit card debt to help them pay their debt down faster.\n Since 2015, funded and facilitated $19.1 billion in environmentally sustainable solutions such as ‘green buildings’, low emissions transport, green bonds, renewable energy and efficient irrigation, exceeding our target ahead of time.\n Joint Lead Manager on $315m National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation social bond, and Lead Manager for Housing New Zealand’s two wellbeing bonds (NZD$500m and NZD$600m) to provide new and upgraded social housing.\nCapital Allocation & Efficiency  Maintained strong CET1 of 11.4% (11.5% proforma) well above APRA’s 10.5%\n‘unquestionably strong’ benchmark; organic capital generation of 75bps for 2H19 – in line with historical averages.\n Reduced shares on issue by 42 million (equivalent of $1.12 billion) as part of the $3 billion\nbuy-back that concluded in March 2019.\n Group’s funding and liquidity position remained strong with the average Liquidity Coverage\nRatio for the second half at 143% and Net Stable Funding Ratio at 116%.\n Neutralised dividend reinvestment program for sixth consecutive half.\nExpense Control & Productivity  Disciplined focus on costs enabled the Group to absorb inflation of $160 million and, the\ncost of increased regulatory and compliance obligations including NZ BS11 requirements, while also continuing to invest in customer initiatives.\n Productivity benefits of around $260 million largely driven by business simplification,\nprocess improvements and consolidation of international property footprint.\n Reduced FTE by a further 1% to 37,588 for continuing operations. A 12% reduction in\nInstitutional, largely through divestments, was offset by a 1% increase in Australia due to higher resources required for compliance and customer remediation.\n Reduced ANZ’s software balance this year by a further 7% to $1.3 billion. More than 70% of\ninvestment spend now expensed, with threshold for capitalisation of software development costs increasing to $20m in 1H16. Continues to be lowest of domestic peers.\nDIVIDEND\nThe Board recognises the importance of maintaining a stable dividend for many shareholders. This year it has assessed a proposed final dividend of 80 cents per share and franking of 70%, which is now appropriate given the changes to our business model, including the divestments of Wealth businesses in Australia, as well as the changing operating environment. This decision took into account ANZ’s strong capital position and its organic capital generation capacity.\n2 ANZ’s progress against its sustainability targets are published on anz.com/cs 3 Executive Committee members excluded given subject to regulatory remuneration structures\nCREDIT QUALITY\nThe total provision charge for the year was $795 million, up 16% from last year. The Group loss rate increased marginally to 13 bps (from 12 bps in 2018). Gross impaired assets reduced 5% year-on-year or $110 million to $2.0 billion. New impaired assets for the year were 2.0 billion, 5% lower than 2018. This was driven by a reduction in Institutional, which was partly offset by an increase in impairments for commercial businesses in Australia. While housing loans past due in Australia stabilised in the most recent quarter, we remain cautious given credit losses remain at historically low levels.\nCAPITAL REVIEWS\nANZ is engaging with both APRA and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) on their announced proposals that could lift the amount of capital required to support our New Zealand subsidiary. The impact of these changes depends on a number of factors and the final outcome remains uncertain. This includes the outcome of consultation, particularly the amount of capital required, the time allowed to achieve it, and the instruments permitted to be used. Given ANZ is in a strong capital position with organic generation capacity, management will maintain its focus on capital efficiency. The Board can consider further capital management actions once any regulatory changes are known in the coming months.\nCUSTOMER REMEDIATION\nAn additional charge of $559 million was announced in October as a result of an increase in provisions for remediation work, taking the total charge to $1.2 billion since 1H17. ANZ recognises the impact this has on both customers and shareholders. We are taking a proactive approach and are conducting detailed reviews across the Group. There are more than 1000 people4 working on remediation. We returned more than $100 million to impacted customers this financial year.\nOUTLOOK\nCommenting on the outlook Mr Elliott said: “The Australian housing market is slowly recovering, however we expect challenging trading conditions to continue for the foreseeable future.\n“We expect the operational improvements made to our Australian home loans business to help restore market share in our targeted segments. Record low interest rates and intense competition will continue to impact profitability.\n“Geopolitical tensions will also place pressure on earnings given our exposure to global trade, although this can be managed through the diversification of our business. Increased compliance and remediation costs will also need to be closely managed over the foreseeable future.\n“Capital efficiency will remain a focus, particularly as we manage the proposed changes impacting our business in New Zealand. While these changes are not final, we are starting from a strong capital position with solid organic generation capability.\n“The environment has evolved as predicted. We have prepared well and our strong sense of purpose has us positioned to thrive in what will continue to be a tough period,” Mr Elliott said.\n4 As at 30 September 2019 there were 500 people working in ANZ’s team dedicated to customer remediation. There are also around a further 500 people working on\nremediation within various business units\nVideo interviews with Chief Executive Officer Shayne Elliott and Chief Financial Officer Michelle Jablko are available at www.bluenotes.anz.com\nFor media enquiries contact:\nFor investor enquiries contact:\nStephen Ries, +61 409 655 551 Nick Higginbottom, +61 403 936 262\nJill Campbell, +61 412 047 448 Cameron Davis, +61 421 613 819"

These loans remain subject to tight parameters around LVR, presale debt cover and quantum of foreign purchaser presales. Overall appetite for Apartment Development has remained unchanged over the last half. The quality and experience of developers and builders remains a key selection criterion.\nOutside of Inner City locations, development exposures are predominantly in the suburbs of the capital cities of the above listed states.\nResidential Development projects continue to be closely monitored with level of oversight driven by progress of the project vs. plan, industry trends and emerging risks.\nTotal Exposure Apartments (>3 levels)\nSep-18 ($b) 10.28 3.97\nSep-19 ($b) 10.60 4.20\nInner City\n0.56\n0.70\n1.

Increase in total coal mining exposure in FY19 primarily reflects mergers and acquisitions activity related to existing mines in 1H19, ie predominantly metallurgical coal assets sold by diversified miners to existing customers along with foreign currency exchange movements. Financing is mainly used to support continuing operations, and not mine expansions.\nThermal coal exposure is currently $838m. We expect our thermal coal exposure to decline over time, as it has since 2015 (reducing by 50% between FY15-FY19). Decreased exposure in 2H19 compared to 1H19 reflects ongoing portfolio management and application of ANZ policies. Our exposures to thermal coal are primarily concentrated in a small number of Australian-based miners.\nExposure to metallurgical coal mining (used for steel making) is currently $686m.\nSep-19\n88\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nANZ INSTITUTIONAL PORTFOLIO (COUNTRY OF INCORPORATION1)\nINSTITUTIONAL PORTFOLIO SIZE & TENOR (EAD2)\nANZ INSTITUTIONAL INDUSTRY COMPOSITION\n$b\nEAD (Sep-19): A$447b2\nFinance (Banks and Central Banks)\n400\n26%\n30%\nGovernment Admin.\nServices to Fin. & Ins.\nProperty Services3\n350\n300\n250\n49%\n2%\n3% 3%\n4%\n8%\n8%\n16%\nBasic Material Wholesaling\nMachinery & Equip Mnfg\nElectricity & Gas Supply\nPetroleum Coal Chem & Assoc Prod Mnfg\nOther⁴\n200\n35%\nANZ INSTITUTIONAL PRODUCT COMPOSITION\n150\nEAD (Sep-19) A$447b2\n100\n50\n0\n51%\n65%\n22%\n78%\n85%\n15%\n0%\n25%\n12%\n20%\n2%\n16%\nLoans & Advances\nTraded Securities (e.g. Bonds)\nContingent Liabilities & Commitments\nTrade & Supply Chain\nDerivatives & Money Market Loans\nGold Bullion\nTotal Institutional\nInternational\nAsia\nChina\nOther\n25%\nTenor < 1 Yr\nTenor 1 Yr+\n1.

With respect to the housing categories, three noteworthy changes included: \nInclusion of building societies, credit unions and other ADIs, resulting in an increase in FUM within the total system, consequently reducing market share of ADIs relative to market share under the MBS publication Change in the definition of what is included within the housing categories (for ANZ total housing reduced by $8.2b (June 2019) within the MADIS publication compared with the MBS publication) Changes to definition of Owner-Occupied and Investment housing based on housing purpose1\n\n\n1.\nAPRA MADIS definition: Loans to households: Housing: Owner-occupied are loans to resident households for the purpose of housing, where the funds are used for a residential property that is occupied or to be occupied by the borrower(s) as their principal place of residence. The principal place of residence means the residential property at which an individual resides for the majority of the year.

This results in a significant increase in unemployment and material nationwide\nfalls in property prices.\nEstimated portfolio losses under these stressed conditions are manageable and within the\nGroup’s capital base, with cumulative total losses at $2.7b over three years (net of LMI\nrecoveries).\nThe results have marginally improved from the stress test six months ago. Key reason for\nthe stressed losses reduction is the improved property price outlook and the impact of the\nthree rate cuts since May 2019, which are reflected in the underlying scenario.\n1.

    "content": "News Release\nFor Release: 31 October 2019\nTranscript of bluenotes interview with ANZ Chief Executive Officer Shayne Elliott\nANDREW CORNELL: Morning Shayne, thanks very much for joining us on bluenotes again on the morning of the annual result. It’s clearly a result which reflects a very different operating environment – one you’ve called challenging. But there are elements of the actual bank, the performance of the bank that you were happy with. So perhaps can we start with you talking about what the global environment was, the external environment and then what parts of the bank, what you did yourself that you were happy with?\nSHAYNE ELLIOTT: Sure. So clearly, for a bank in particular, our results very much reflect the operating environment and you stand back and think about what’s happening around the world, and here in Australia, there are a lot of factors that have made this a much more challenging year than we’ve been used to. So we’ve seen some of the global trade tensions – that has an impact. We’ve seen this trend to much lower interest rates everywhere in the world and now including here in Australia – that has an impact on bank profitability. It’s not that long ago we just finished the Royal Commission. The Royal Commission has had a real impact in terms of what we’re focused on, in terms of remediation and putting our best people to work on those issues – that has an impact on what we’re doing. And of course there are parts of the economy that are doing well, but there are parts that are doing not so well. And so all of those things conspire, plus good old fashioned competition, to make it a really kind of a challenging year to see real top-line growth and that was the experience that we had. Having said that, I am pleased with the progress we made. None of those things were unpredictable, in fact our point is that ANZ’s been really preparing for this for some period of time. That’s why for the last four years, we’ve talked about simplification, we’ve talked about capital efficiency and we’ve talked about productivity. And those things really did benefit the group this year and we’ve continued to focus on those to set us up for longer term success.\nANDREW CORNELL: And those elements that have done well and that you have been working on for a couple of years, do you need to shift that focus at all given the challenging external conditions?\nSHAYNE ELLIOTT: Yes, I mean that’s an ongoing challenge. I know we’re a very large organisation and we are blessed with many resources, but even ANZ, even we cannot do everything. And so this year we’ve seen a really significant increase in the investment we have around … putting things right. The sad reality is that we have a lot of things to fix up, not just from the Royal Commission but in terms of ongoing remediations. That takes a lot of our very bright people, takes a lot of money and technology resource. So that is absolutely our number one priority and there’s more we’ve got to do there, but I’m really pleased with that and that has become – as I say – a big drain on resources. So we’ve done that. Productivity; in a lower-growth world like a lot of businesses out there – a lot of our customers – when times are tough you have to react suitably. So we’ve put a lot more effort into rethinking what we’re doing, who we’re doing it with, and our cost base in particular. So we made lots of progress on that as well. This is another year, for example, where we were able to keep our costs flat or down. Not easy in the environment, but appropriate for the times.\nANDREW CORNELL: And if we look at the three main divisions of the bank, Institutional, New Zealand and Australia. Good solid results from Institutional and New Zealand,\nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited ABN 11 005 357 522\ndisappointing result from Australia. Can you talk us through what went awry in Australia and how you see the steps to improve that?\nSHAYNE ELLIOTT: So the good news here is that we did have really great results in New Zealand and Institutional and let’s not forgot that those businesses were probably earlier into a period of transformation. It’s not that long ago that we talked about Institutional as having some real challenges to it in terms of generating decent returns in growth. And because of the hard work we’ve done there in terms of productivity and getting their capital efficiency right, that business is really doing well. And what we love about Institutional at ANZ – it’s part of our DNA and what we do particularly well – it provides real diversification for our shareholders. That’s a part of … partly because it’s an international focus and partly because it’s exposed to different parts of the economy. So that was really great to see and we’re very pleased with that result and, importantly, a really low-risk result there. Australia; Australia’s had a lot of these issues, these global issues and the outcomes of regulatory change and the Royal Commission – it’s all sort of hit at once. And so, that’s meant we’ve had to make a lot of changes in that business in a really short period of time and that does have an impact on business momentum, there’s no doubt about that. Early on I admitted that we didn’t always make the right decisions around some of that. But the good news is that when we had made mistakes, we were quick to recognise it and act. I’m really pleased with where we are today in terms of business momentum in Australia. We’re getting our, sort of mojo back there if you will out in the marketplace. We’ve got some really competitive product offerings, we’re seeing our market share and volume increase again. So I’m pleased with where we are, but I acknowledge it’s been a pretty messy year in parts of our Australia business.\nANDREW CORNELL: We’re a couple of years at ANZ into agile working, New Ways of Working. Has that helped or hindered the transformation that’s going on in the Australian bank and how you’ve responded here?\nSHAYNE ELLIOTT: Oh it’s a massive help. There’s a lot of stuff written about this, but what’s it essentially about? It’s essentially about breaking down work into bite size chunks and being really agile. Making sure that when things happen in your business, when customers change their behaviour or when we see things changing from regulators or the environment, that we’re able to quickly respond. So it’s just a different mindset and it’s been enormously valuable to ANZ. I think part of the reason we’ve been able to get back on the front foot in terms of our home loan business in particular, was absolutely due to the agile approach that we had. So I think it’s been an enormous benefit.\nANDREW CORNELL: One of the other things you’ve spoken about a bit now, it’s the assumptions around the cost of capital. Now I notice the Reserve Bank has said the same thing, that assumptions around the cost of capital are probably too high. So what does that mean in practice? Does that cause you to rethink the business?\nSHAYNE ELLIOTT: It was an observation I made, we were thinking about our own business, running our own business. But also, I spend a lot of time talking to customers and I was just reflecting on the fact that with interest rates a lot lower, the reality is that when you do the maths and figure out your cost of capital, so as a bank we’ve always assumed – well always, for the last four or five years – that our cost of capital was around 10 per cent. So we set our hurdle rates of what a good investment looks like. What we ask the business to deliver is relative to that.\nBut actually if you do that maths today, our cost of capital is probably closer to 8 - 8.5 per cent. That’s a material difference. So we need to reset our expectations. And what I’ve been out testing with a lot of our customers is, how do they think about that? And it’s one of those things where our brain can tell us: `yes, you’re right, I understand the cost of equity is lower’. But actually in terms of just the way we’re running our business, the signals we’re sending to our front lines, the way we think about investments, whether that investment’s a good thing for us to do with shareholders’ money. That takes a little bit of time to catch up. So I think what the Reserve Bank’s saying is absolutely right.\nANDREW CORNELL: And on the dividend front, the dividend’s steady, but it’s not fully franked this year. Can you walk us through that decision?\nSHAYNE ELLIOTT: So the first thing to acknowledge here is that it’s a very important decision and we’re very aware of the impact that it has on our shareholders and we don’t take that lightly. So what are the factors that we take into account? Well first, of course, is just the shape of our business and the degree to which our Australian earnings and the amount that they represent in our overall group profits. So that’s one, and that’s changed. Partly because we’ve sold some businesses in Australia, for the right reason, for the benefit in the long term for shareholders. And partly because, as we’ve mentioned, the profitability of the Australian business is under pressure. So that’s the first thing.\nThe second thing is the bank has actually got a very strong balance sheet, so we’ve got a lot of capital and we continue to be profitable. And part of that’s because of our international business, New Zealand and Institutional, have held up their earnings very well. So that’s enabled us to maintain the dividend overall, but not maintain the level of franking. And then finally, of course, we do take into account that shareholders want some level of predictability around the dividend and want to know ‘how do I think about it over the longer term’ and we’ve also tried to give some sense of that in this decision. And that’s why the Board decided; maintain the dividend at 80 cents, however reduce the franking to 70 per cent.\nANDREW CORNELL: Well, thanks very much for speaking with us this morning Shayne.

    "content": "News Release\nFor Release: 31 October 2019\nTranscript of bluenotes interview with ANZ Chief Financial Officer Michelle Jablko\nANDREW CORNELL: Morning Michelle. Thanks very much for joining us on the morning of the annual result. It was a flat result in quite challenging conditions. Can you pull it apart a bit for us in terms of the remediation, the simplification programme, the transformation programme and where are we seeing the impacts of those elements?\nMICHELLE JABLKO: Sure. Simplification’s probably about two things. It’s about doing less things to simplify the business, so you’ve seen we’ve sold quite a lot of businesses this year – we completed the sale of our life insurance businesses in Australia and New Zealand and also businesses in Cambodia and PNG. But it’s also about being simpler in terms … and more efficient in the things we continue to do. And you’ll see, if you look at our cost result this year, the underlying costs are down 1.6% so very, very well managed this year. ANDREW CORNELL: And given what we’re seeing globally; economies are weaker, interest rates are trending down towards zero, regulatory pressures are still going up. Does the focus of that work then need to shift?\nMICHELLE JABLKO: I think times are definitely tougher for the reasons you mention Andrew, but I don’t think it changes what we’re doing. I think it underscores actually what we’ve been doing for a while. And so for us it’s, costs coming down over time continues to be a focus of ours. But it’s not just about costs for costs’ sake, it’s about improving things for our customers. So for example, we think we can significantly reduce the number of steps in our mortgage process, probably by about half. It’s also about reducing operational risk in the system and taking the need for future remediation out.\nANDREW CORNELL: When we look at the result, it’s a flat result, but in that flat result we see a good, solid performance in New Zealand, a solid performance in Institutional. The weakness is the biggest part of the bank, the Australian division and particularly on the revenue front. Can you talk us through that?\nMICHELLE JABLKO: I think that’s exactly right Andrew. Revenue in Australia division was down $590 million. Actually, most of that was because of lower margins and lower fees this year. But, in terms of the biggest part of our business, our home loans, we did also have a slow-down – partly because of the market – but also we had some execution challenges in the business.\nANDREW CORNELL: We see in this, and you’ve mentioned this, that the investment spend is increasing and a lot of that is around regulatory and compliance issues. Now, we can see that some of that will probably flow through, but some of it is more enduring. Is there positive sides to this investment spend?\nMICHELLE JABLKO: Yes. Overall our investment spend is up almost $200 million this year, that’s within the lower costs I spoke about earlier, while quite a bit of it is regulatory and compliance. So for example, in New Zealand we’ve got a requirement to effectively create a standalone system over there. And in Australia there are a range of regulatory and compliance projects we’re working through. I can understand why some people would classify them as pure regulatory and compliance, if you like. But the way we’re thinking about them is actually we can use them to make our businesses a lot better, improve our processes, internal processes, improve the way we use our data. So I think there is real upside for the business that will come from it. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited ABN 11 005 357 522\nANDREW CORNELL: We’ve spoken elsewhere specifically about the dividend. But when we think about capital, and you’ve touched on capital there. What is the overall capital position? And it’s more than just the dividend, where are your options with capital?\nMICHELLE JABLKO: Our capital position remains really strong. In terms of our core equity, it’s about $3.5 billion above “unquestionably strong”. So, really strong position to start with. There are a number of potential regulatory changes that are in consultation right now, and we’re working with regulators on those. As I look at those, for us yes they may provide some challenges in terms of capital allocation and capital efficiency. But, given where we start from and the strength of our capital position, and also the capital we’re generating every year, the issue for us is more about efficiency than the amount of capital.\nANDREW CORNELL: You’re the Chief Financial Officer, you’re looking at the balance sheet, so what’s happening with interest rates is front and centre in your area. Now historically, lower interest rates have hit bank margins, is that the case today? And, if so, what else are you seeing with these near zero interest rates and how do you manage that?\nMICHELLE JABLKO: It was certainly the case this year. And the reason is we’ve got about $110 billion worth of deposits globally where they’re at pretty close to zero rates. On top of that we have capital we invest and as interest rates come down, it reduces the earnings we achieve on those. So just in the past six months, the impact of lower rates has had about a 6 basis point impact on margins. And while there’s some benefit from funding costs and some pricing decisions taken, they weren’t near enough to offset the impact of lower rates.\nANDREW CORNELL: Well thanks again Michelle for speaking with us this morning.\nMICHELLE JABLKO: Thanks Andrew, great to talk.\nFor media enquiries contact:\nStephen Ries, +61 409 655 551 Nick Higginbottom, +61 403 936 262"

While reviews by the FMA and RBNZ concluded the widespread misconduct issues in Australia were not found in New Zealand they helped us take stock of where we are today, what we’re doing well and what we could do better for our customers, and we’re making changes,” Ms Watson said.\n“Beyond those reviews we have faced our own challenges. Despite our tough year our people have continued to put our customers first every day.\n“Our customers continue to choose ANZ because our staff are committed to doing what’s best for them. We offer products and services that help Kiwis achieve their goals, we continue to sharpen the value we offer by making banking easier and more accessible, monitoring our fees and interest rates and giving back to our communities.”\nDespite the difficult year ANZ New Zealand continued to perform well, Ms Watson said.\n“While underlying revenue growth has been subdued, both customer deposits were up 5%, and gross lending up 4%. Our focus on responsible lending means credit quality remains strong and provision charges low.\n“Strong competition in the home lending market combined with Official Cash Rate cuts saw interest rates drop to the lowest levels on record, providing a good opportunity for first home buyers to enter the market and for home owners to pay off as much debt as possible.”\nRemediation and increased regulatory requirements contributed to a 5% increase in operating expenses on a cash NPAT basis.\nMs Watson said the New Zealand economy, while growing at a slower pace, is fundamentally in good shape which is promising for businesses moving into 2020.\n“Demand for commodity exports is healthy, construction activity is firm, plus lower interest rates and an easing NZD are supporting activity.

Revaluation of insurance policiesFair value gains and losses are recognised in the Income Statement on economic and revenue hedges used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk. The mark to market adjustments on these derivatives, not designated in an accounting hedge, are removed from cash profit as the fair value gains or losses will reverse over time to match the profit or loss on the hedged item. Included in economic hedges are funding related swaps and specialised leasing transactions.To calculate certain policy liabilities, projected future cash flows on insurance contracts are discounted at a market discount rate to the present value of the obligation. Any change is reflected in the Income Statement each period. The volatility from changes in market discount rates is removed from cash profit each year as the impact reverts to zero over the life of the insurance contract. Accumulated gains of $86m after tax have been returned to cash profit upon the sale of OPL NZ as noted in point 1 above.Statutory profit for the half year ended 31 March 2019 includes a $59m gain on sale of OnePath Life (NZ) Ltd (OPL NZ) and a $39m gain on sale of Paymark Ltd.

I'm Jill Campbell. I'm the Head of\nInvestor Relations for ANZ. Welcome to everyone joining us in\nSydney today, listening in by phone or webcast for the\npresentation of our full year 2019 financial results. We're live\nstreaming today's presentation on social media, through\nPeriscope and Twitter and you can access the feed by\nsearching at ANZ News.\nThe result materials lodged earlier this morning with the ASX\nare all available on the ANZ website in the shareholder centre.\nA replay of the presentation, along with the Q&A, will be\navailable via the website from around mid-afternoon. Our\nCEO, Shayne Elliott and CFO, Michelle Jablko, will present for\naround 25 minutes and after that we'll go to Q&A, thanks\nShayne.\nThank you. Good morning. Today is about result and it's\nimportant to cover where we are, but frankly it's more\nimportant to share what we will do from here. I could spend\nsome significant time talking about how challenging the\nenvironment is, but you all know that. More regulation, intense\ncompetition, low rates and slow growth, we get it, but we are\nprepared well. Earnings this year were stable, we further\nstrengthened the balance sheet, exited more non-core\nbusinesses and we kept costs flat while absorbing a significant\nincrease in investment.\n2\nThe number of shares on issue reduced again and earnings\nper share increased 2% and net tangible assets per share,\n6%. I am pleased that we are able to maintain our dividend at\n$0.80, although I acknowledge that some shareholders will be\ndisappointed that we're reducing franking to 70%. Our decision\nto reduce franking to a new base reflects the changed shape\nof our business, but recognises how important the dividend,\nfranking and predictability is to our shareholders.\nOur balance sheet has never been stronger. We've delivered\nsignificant change in the past four years, rebalancing our\nportfolio and improving capital efficiency and 2019 was no\nexception. That allowed us to return $5.6 billion to\nshareholders while still increasing our capital.\nIn a large organisation there will always be a lot of things we\ncan do, but it's our job to ensure that our resources are\nfocused on those things that make a real difference. We've\ntweaked words and tightened up the language, but the\nstrategy we launched in 2016 remains relevant and\nappropriate. For 2020 we've implemented a six-point plan,\nmodified accountability for our top team, changed governance\nprocesses all the way up to the Board, enhanced the metrics\nwe use to monitor results and we've increased pace. We meet\nmore briefly but more often and we make more timely\ndecisions.\nAs I said, we're focused on the six levers that we think will\nhave the biggest impact: running the business well,\nmaintaining discipline within Institutional, resolving our\nchallenges in New Zealand, investing to prepare Australia for\ngrowth, driving further simplification and building the team's\nresilience and capability.\n3\nIt's easy to get distracted, but running the business well is our\ntop priority. It's particularly true in Australia where we have\nacknowledged our challenges. We've responded appropriately,\nwe've changed the leadership team and the organisational\nstructure. We're refining credit policies and investing to reduce\nprocessing times and increased capacity. We're delegating\nmore decisions to the frontline and monitoring operational\nmetrics daily.\nWe launched an incredibly successful campaign to provide\nconfidence for our channels and our customers and while the\nresulting in uplift in applications is good, the real benefit was\nthe preparation work that we did to improve operational\ncapacity and reduce approval turnarounds. These actions\nposition us well as we head into 2020. However, while the\nhousing market shows some signs of improvement, system\ngrowth remains hard to predict. Low interest rates are also\nputting pressure on margins and managing that trade-off is\ncomplex, but we're focused on managing risk-adjusted margin\nmore than simple market share growth.\nRunning the business well also requires progress on\nremediation, because it's the right thing to do, but also\nbecause the sooner we finish, the sooner we can apply\nlearnings and refocus on responsible growth. For a range of\nreasons, ANZ started a little earlier than our peers and from\nwhat we can see, we're a little further ahead. We're investing\neverything required to complete known remediations and\nidentify any new issues. I can't tell you when we will be\nfinished, but we are working as hard as we can to get it done.\nFinally, running the business well means strengthening the\nBank, operationally, culturally and financially. The work done\nover four years to simplify and de-risk the Bank has seen our\nexpected loss rates fall again.\n4\nWe are not complacent and we do expect to return to more\nnormal credit conditions at some point, but our book is\ninherently lower risk than before. We have not changed our\nrisk appetite, although we have reduced our assumptions\naround cost of capital, which will have an impact on the\nbusiness rating strategy, particularly in Institutional.\nInstitutional provides diversification to shareholders and unique\nvalue to customers. Its returns are now above our cost of\ncapital and as industry returns for the Australian banking peers\nfall, our Institutional business is increasing in relative value.\nBut we're not done. Our plan for Institutional is simple: keep\ndisciplined.\nThere is no change in strategy, there is no change in target\nmarket, we will continue to do more with the customers we\nknow and trust. We will do more on cost and simplification,\nwhile strengthening the franchise and we will stay disciplined\non credit and focused on the risk-adjusted returns.\nIn New Zealand, the Reserve Bank has two major changes on\nthe table: BS11 and the proposed new capital regime.\nPreparation for BS11 is well advanced but it comes at a cost,\nwhich we estimate at around $350 million over three years.\nWe've already invested $42 million in FY19, which explains the\nincrease in New Zealand operating expense. BS11 investment\nis not called out as a large and notable item. Now Michelle will\ntalk through the proposed capital changes, but I've expressed\nmy concerns about them, but we're not sitting by hoping for the\nbest.\nWe're taking the proposals as a catalyst to do better, to be\nleaner and more focused. We meet weekly and we're actively\nworking on a range of initiatives which will lead to a portfolio of\nactions. We intend to remain the largest and most successful\nbank for New Zealanders, but how we go about delivering that\nwill change.\n5\nThose priorities are about running the place well, but we also\nneed to invest for the future, particularly in Australia. Australian\nretail and commercial banking is a good business, generating\ndecent returns, but it's getting tougher. We've strengthened\nour balance sheet, we've reduced operating risk and we've\nmaterially improved productivity and that gives us the capacity\nto invest without calling on shareholders. Over the past decade\nwe've invested about $1.2 billion each year in new technology\nand systems across the Group. In 2019, we invested a record\namount of $1.4 billion and we will invest even more in 2020.\nOther than BS11, that increase is focused on Australia, but we\ndidn't do this on a buy-now-pay-later scheme; 70% of the\ninvestment is expensed during the year. As a result, software\nassets on our balance sheet continue to decline and remain\nthe lowest amongst our peers, reflecting our more\nconservative approach to paying up front for investment and\nholding ourselves to account to deliver outcomes. The\ninvestments we're making in Australia will reshape ANZ for the\ncoming decade and my team is deeply involved in the detail.\nSimpler and better has become the industry mantra. We\nstarted early, but it is getting harder. Looking through the\nnoise, our cost base today is around $8.6 billion and getting to\nthis point hasn't been easy. I will remind you that it's the lowest\ncost base in six years and we've absorbed a lot of change over\nthat time. Revenue is also $450 million higher today than six\nyears ago, despite selling 23 businesses.\nWe are now focused on simplifying key customer and support\nfunction processes that represent around 70% of that cost\nbase. The work is coordinated with other priorities, particularly\nthe investment in Australia and while some is already\nunderway, the major execution will start in the new year.\n6\nMichelle Jablko:\nWe will not jeopardise the franchise to meet an arbitrary target,\nbut we remain confident that staying true to our strategy and\nimproving customer outcomes will reduce the cost of running\nthe bank to $8 billion. This work is incredibly important and I\nam personally leading it.\nIt is hackneyed but our ultimate competitive advantage is our\nculture and that means our people. We're asking more of our\nteam than ever before, particularly in terms of change and\naccountability. I don't see that environment getting any easier\nand so we're investing to build capability and resilience and\nthere are signs that this is having an impact. Our culture audits\nshow that our people believe in the strategy, are committed to\ndoing the right thing and want ANZ to succeed. We recently\nrecorded the highest employee engagement score in our\nhistory at 77% and we saw an 82% increase in applicants for\ngraduate roles. I don’t take the engagement of our people for\ngranted and we will continue to invest in their capability,\nproviding them with better tools and supporting them through a\nchallenging environment.\nI'll now hand over to Michelle to walk through the results in\nmore detail.\nThanks Shayne and good morning. This year we had three\nthings to balance: fixing issues of the past, running our\nbusiness well and building for the future. Right now, like many\nin the industry, we're more heavily weighted towards fixing\npast issues. But we've also been investing more to further\nsimplify the business and build for the future. Against this\nbackdrop we had a solid result.\nContinuing cash profit was flat at $6.5 billion. EPS was up 2%\nand ROE was stable. Revenue in our Australian retail and\ncommercial business was down $590 million, reflecting margin\nand fee pressures and some execution challenges.\n7\nWe saw the benefits of disciplined growth in Institutional, with\ncash profit up 11% and ROE almost 100 basis points higher.\nCosts of the Group were well managed and even with higher\ninvestment, they were down 1.6% FX adjusted. Credit losses\nremained low, benefiting from significant work in recent years\nto de-risk the business. Our work on customer remediation\ncontinued and we took $682 million in post-tax remediation\ncharges. So while the broader operating environment was\nchallenging, we maintained cash profit and increased EPS.\nWe also maintained the dividend at $0.80 per share, but it will\nbe franked at 70%. I'll spend some time at the end taking you\nthrough this once we've discussed the result.\nBalance sheet strength has been the key plank of our strategy.\nOur CET1 ratio is 11.4%, around $3.5 billion above\nunquestionably strong. Organic capital generation remained\nhigh at 165 basis points for the full year. We returned capital to\nour shareholders, completing $1.1 billion in share buybacks\nthis year. We neutralised the DRP for the sixth consecutive\nhalf and absorbed 60 basis points of new regulatory imposts\nduring the year.\nSo while there are clearly some regulatory uncertainties, we\nface them from a position of strength. We're engaging with our\nregulators on a number of possible capital changes. Most of\nthese remain in consultation. While in the past the primary\nfocus has been on Level 2 Group capital, these potential\nchanges put an increased focus on Level 1.\nThis slide shows the difference between Level 1 and Level 2\ncapital generation this year. The difference stems largely from\nour New Zealand Board already retaining around $1.5 billion of\nthe possible higher capital that might be required in New\nZealand over the next few years. We expect the RBNZ's final\nposition in December.\n8\nAPRA has also released a consultation paper on investment in\nsubsidiaries. While the paper implies an impact of $2.5 billion,\nthere are measures that could materially offset this. In short,\nwhile there are still many moving parts, our capital position\nmeans that these proposals are more about capital efficiency\nthan quantum. Once we have more clarity, we will consider\nfuture capital management and capital allocation opportunities.\nThere are six key things that really shaped the result this year:\nlower revenue in Australia, disciplined growth in Institutional,\nmargin pressures across the Group, good outcomes on cost\nand credit quality, and further customer remediation charges.\nAustralia revenues were down $590 million for the year, but\nstabilised in the second half. $530 million of the reduction was\ndue to lower margins and fees. $60 million was due to lower\nvolume, largely because of the slower housing market and\nsome execution issues in home loans, as well as lower credit\ncard and personal loan volumes, in line with market trends,\nsubdued lending volumes in small business but good deposit\ngrowth and the continued runoff of our consumer asset finance\nbusiness.\nOur mortgage portfolio is down $7 billion for the full year,\nalmost all in interest only loans. In the second half of the year,\nwe significantly improved our home loan assessment times,\nwith better clarity and consistency on policy and risk settings\nfor the front line. This has seen the overall rate of decline in\nthe portfolio progressively slow over the course of the second\nhalf. We also ran a major marketing campaign to attract new\ncustomers and restore confidence across our distribution\nchannels. As a result, application volumes increased, with\naverage levels in the second half more than 30% higher than\nthe first. Importantly, our improved momentum has continued,\nwith application volumes now not far below the campaign\naverage and slightly below 2018 levels.\n9\nThis improved momentum takes time to flow through to the\nbalance sheet and needs to be balanced against higher\namortisation, with 82% of customers paying principal and\ninterest and many customers now getting ahead on their\nrepayments, given lower interest rates.\nInstitutional continues to deliver the benefits of a simpler and\nmore disciplined business. On a year-on-year basis, revenue,\nprofit and ROE all increased. This was driven by another\nrecord year in payments and cash management, where\nrevenue was up 10%. Loans also performed well, up 7%.\nMarkets were flat year on year at around $1.8 billion, with the\nsecond half impacted by a flattening yield curve and low\nvolatility. Market sales were up and were actually more than\nhalf of market's revenues for the year.\nLower interest rates and competitive pressures continue to\nimpact margins. Underlying NIM was down five basis points.\nAsset and funding mix had a two basis point impact. With rate\ncuts globally, deposit margins were down four basis points,\nmostly in Australia. Lower rates also impacted earnings on\ncapital and our replicating portfolios by a further two basis\npoints. There was some benefit from lower wholesale funding\ncosts and some asset repricing, but these weren't enough to\noffset the significant impact of lower rates and competitive\npressures across all businesses.\nThese headwinds on margins are likely to remain in the near\nterm. Competition and mix impacts are continuing. There will\nbe a further negative impact in the first half of 2020 from rate\ncuts that have already happened, including the RBA rate cut\nearlier this month and the Fed cut overnight. This is around\nthree basis points and net of recent repricing decisions.\n10\nAny additional rate cuts would have further impacts. We know\nthat around $110 billion of our deposits globally are already at\nor near zero rates, so any further cuts would impact deposit\nmargins as well as our earnings on invested capital.\nAdjusted for FX costs across the Group were down 1.6% this\nyear, despite the impact of higher regulatory and compliance\ncosts and inflation. Costs in institutional were down for the\nseventh half in a row, costs in Australia were flat.\nThis year we generated $260 million of savings across the\nGroup after absorbing inflation of $160 million. For example,\nwe have reduced FTE through automation and process\nimprovements. We replaced higher cost managed services\nwith internal resources and technology. We continued to\nreduce our property spend through consolidation of our\ninternational footprint as well as optimisation of our branch\nnetwork.\nThis outcome has not been at the expense of investment. In\nfact investment spend is up $185 million over the year. Quite\na bit of the increase has been for regulatory and compliance\nspend, such as meeting our BS11 requirements in New\nZealand and a number of compliance projects in Australia.\nOther investment has been skewed to Australian retail and\ncommercial, along with digital data and payments initiatives.\nWhilst some might categorise regulatory and compliance\nspend as an extra burden, this spend also improves the\nbusiness through enhanced data quality, better customer\norigination processes, and lower operational risk.\nImportantly 70% of our investment spend is recognised upfront\nas OpEx, given our $20 million capitalisation threshold.\nDriving our capitalised software balance to a new low of $1.3\nbillion.\n11\nOur disciplined approach to credit quality has continued to\ndeliver with a loss rate of only 13 basis points for the year.\nCredit impairment charges were higher in absolute terms but\noff a low base and largely due to release of collective\nprovisions in the prior year.\nInstitutional remained well managed with zero net IP charges\nand a 40% reduction in impaired assets. This wasn’t because\nof write-backs and recoveries, which were down $100 million\nin the division.\nOur collective provision remains strong at $3.4 billion.\nAdjusting for regulatory capital in costs our coverage ratio\nremains stable.\nGross and new impaired assets were both down 5% year-on-\nyear. Australian mortgage 90 days past due were 116 basis\npoints at the end of September and stabilised in the fourth\nquarter. The absolute number of loans past due and losses\nboth remain small. Across our book 76% of customers are\nahead on their repayments, and 82% are now paying principal\nand interest.\nWe have continued to make substantial progress on\nremediation this year. On 8 October we announced additional\nremediation charges of $559 million, bringing our full year\ncharge to $682 million. Total remediation charges over the\npast three years are around $1.6 billion. Our balance sheet\nprovision now stands at around $1.1 billion.\nOur costs of remediation have increased as we have\nexpanded the number of staff supporting our efforts to just\nover 1000. Around 70% of the current year charge relates to\nbanking product and service remediation as we accelerated\nour proactive discovery reviews. These product reviews are\nongoing. We have provided for what we know and we are\nworking hard to put customers right as soon as possible.\n12\nTurning to the dividend. The Board has proposed to maintain\na final dividend of $0.80 per share, franked at 70%, and to\nneutralise the DRP. In making its dividend decision the Board\nconsidered a range of options and the interests of all\nshareholders, including retail. The Board landed on $0.80 per\nshare supported by our strong capital position.\nOn franking, you know that our position has been tight for a\nwhile. This half was franked at 70%. While there are some\nsubtleties around timing of tax payments, statutory profit in our\nAustralian geography is the key driver here. These earnings\nhave declined over the past couple of years with lower\nunderlying revenue, remediation costs, the bank levy and the\ndivestment of wealth.\nThis year Australian geographic earnings were 55% of our\ntotal, compared to a dividend payout ratio of 76%.\nGiven the current operating environment I thought it might be\nuseful to provide some context for the first half of 2020. On\nAustralian housing lead indicators for ANZ suggest momentum\nis improving. While we expect this to lead to improvement in\nnew volumes, this needs to be balanced with faster\namortisation of our existing book in a low rate environment.\nOn margins a combination of competitive pressures, mix\nimpacts and low rates across all of our geographies will\ncontinue to have an impact.\nIn the past we have said that we manage markets as a $2\nbillion business in terms of capital and resource allocation.\nHowever in a world of lower global growth and rates revenues\nare likely to be closer to current full year levels in the near\nterm, and we're changing out settings accordingly.\n13\nShayne Elliott:\nOn expenses we are committed to absolute cost reduction.\nBut as we have said, the paths may not always be linear. With\nthis in mind we expect underlying expenses in the first half of\n2020 to be around $150 million to $200 million higher than the\nsecond half of '19. We will have a new accounting standard\non leases and higher investment, including BS11.\nIn the medium-term lowering costs remains an intense focus\nso that we can fund investment in our business and meet our\n$8 billion cost ambition. The first half is also likely to bring\nclarity on regulatory capital. Once we have this we can\ndetermine our business response and any future capital\nmanagement opportunities.\nOverall while the operating environment is tough our efforts to\ncreate a simpler, stronger and more productive ANZ place us\nin a good position. With that I'll hand back to Shayne.\nAbout four years ago we identified the need for bold action to\nreposition ANZ for long-term success. We recognised that\nwhile banking would remain attractive a step-change in the\noperating environment meant that strategies of the past would\nno longer be successful. We have work to do but have\nprepared well by strengthening our balance sheet, reducing\nfinancial and non-financial risk, simplifying the bank,\nenhancing management capability and improving productivity.\nThere is no change in our strategy and we are fully focused on\nexecution. Low interest rates and the weaker global economy\nmean that growing revenue will be difficult. Remediation\nrequires ongoing effort, and we do need to invest for future\ngrowth.\n14\nCredit conditions are benign but they will turn at some point.\nBut our balance sheet is strong, our revenue sources diverse\nand we have a clear plan with a focus on simplification,\nproductivity and capital efficiency. Our people are more\nengaged than ever.\nI do not underestimate the challenge. But remaining true to\nour purpose, values and our strategy will unlock opportunity to\nthe benefit of our customers and shareholders alike.\n15"

Since that time, the business has faced some difficult times.\nAn ANZ customer for 10 years, Brian has appreciated the bank’s support through those times. “During the algae bloom in 2010 I went to ANZ and pleaded relief. We did not know when things would pick up. I am grateful for ANZ sticking with us through that time”.\nBrian recently found himself seeking the assistance of one of those agencies, reaching out to the Rural Financial Counselling Services (Southern NSW). The service, which is free, supports rural businesses through ongoing drought, poor production or anything else affecting their business and their life.\nFast forward to 2019 and Brian’s business is once again facing difficulties, this time as a result of the drought impacting much of Australia.\n“When you’re doing it tough it’s all too hard, and the state you are in does not always lead to rational decisions,” says Brian. “The financial counsellor looks at you as a person, as well as a business.”\n“Oyster farming needs fresh water,” says Brian. “Famine on the land means famine in the sea. The oysters have poor growth, it’s difficult to maintain their condition and they’re harder to sell.”\nLast year in response to the drought ANZ donated $500,000 to the Financial Counselling Foundation for use by rural counselling agencies working in drought affected communities.\nBrian looks forward to building up the business again, but he doubts things will ever be as good as they were in 1985. “This business is mostly about loving the lifestyle. People who want to be on the water and love working outdoors in Australia’s oldest aquaculture industry.”\nImage: Brian Coxon\nContents\n2019 performance snapshot\n1\nOur people\nOur 2019 reporting suite\n2\nOur community\nWhat matters most\n3\nGovernance\nChairman’s message\n4\nRisk management\nCEO’s message\n6\nPerformance overview\nAbout our business\n8\nFive year summary\nOur strategy\n9\nRemuneration Report\nHow we create value\n10\nDirectors’ Report\nWorking with our stakeholders\n12\nFinancial Report\nOur operating environment\n14\nShareholder information (unaudited)\nBecoming a fairer and more responsible bank\n16\nGlossary\nOur customers\n17\nImportant dates for shareholders\nOur divisions\n21\nContacts\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\n24\n28\n32\n44\n52\n64\n66\n99\n101\n220\n227\n229\n230\n$\n2019 performance snapshot\n6.5\nCash proﬁt1\nb\n10.9%\nCash return on equity1\n160¢\nDividend for FY19 per share\n228¢\n9.2%\ntotal shareholder return\nCash earnings per share 1\n$19.59\nNet tangible assets per share 2\nCO2\n42.4%\nof employees volunteered\n11.4%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital 3\n$19.1b\nfunded and facili tated in environmentally sustainable solutions since 2015\n$\n>90,000\npeople have been reached through our ﬁnancial wellbeing programs, MoneyMinded and Saver Plus\n32.5%\nof women in leadership4\n$142.2m\nin community investment5\n1.

We seek to identify those issues that have the most potential to impact our ability to operate successfully and create value for our stakeholders.\nNew icons/infographics\nThese issues may change over time, reflecting changes in our business and external operating environment and the expectations of stakeholders. We use the results of the assessment to inform our strategy.\nWe have drawn on our 2018 materiality assessment to help guide the content of this report. After fairness and ethical conduct, stakeholders ranked the following four issues (risks or opportunities) as having the most potential to impact our value creation in the short, medium and long-term.\nMost material issues icons\nCustomer story icon\nThis year, we focused our assessment solely on fairness and ethical conduct, which has been ranked as our most material issue for the last three years. Specifically, we sought external stakeholder views on the actions we are taking following the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry (the Royal Commission).\nFraud and data security: ensuring we have strong internal controls and risk management frameworks in place is critical as a breach could significantly impact the bank’s operations and reputation.\nMost material issues icons\nCustomer story icon\nCustomer experience: ensuring a positive customer experience is key to delivering sustainable business performance in the long-term.\nMost material issues icons\nCustomer story icon\nNew icons/infographics\nStakeholders provided us with three key insights:\nCorporate governance: organisations with strong corporate governance processes and policies in place are likely to perform better in the long-term.\n1 They expect us to focus on long-term value creation, Most material issues icons\nCustomer story icon\nnot short-term profit maximisation;\nStakeholder icons\nNew icons/infographics\n2 While the actions we have taken to date in response to the Royal Commission are considered good and necessary, they want us to do more. In particular, they expect Board and management to demonstrate customer-centric New icons/infographics actions in line with the ‘spirit’ of the Royal Commission’s findings; and\nDigital innovation: core to our strategy and a key factor in driving positive customer experience.\nA full list of ANZ’s key material risks is available on pages 46–47.\n3 They see a broader role for the Board in overseeing conduct and culture and an expectation that real and lasting change happens as a result of the Royal Commission.\nThe key steps undertaken in our 2019 materiality process, as well as the full list of our material ESG issues, is discussed in our 2019 ESG Supplement available at anz.com/cs in December.\nNew icons/infographics\nStakeholder icons\n3\nHow We Creat Value Icons\nStakeholder icons\nStakeholder icons\nStakeholder icons\nHow We Creat Value Icons\nHow We Creat Value Icons\nHow We Creat Value Icons\nHow We Creat Value Icons\nChairman’s message\nDAVID GONSKI, AC\nChallenging conditions continued in 2019 and our statutory profit of $6.0 billion was down 7% on the previous year. Cash profit from continuing operations (which excludes non-core items and the discontinued Wealth businesses from statutory profit) was $6.5 billion, flat when compared with the same time last year.\nDespite those tough conditions, we held our FY19 full year dividend at 160 cents with the final dividend of 80 cents franked at 70%.\nWe recognise how important the dividend, franking and predictability is to shareholders. The Board’s decision to reduce franking to a new base reflects the changed shape of our business and the earnings in our Australian geography.\nThis has been a difficult year for us and Australian banks generally. Intense competition, slow credit growth and increased regulation have combined with lower consumer confidence to create this.\nWhile this is reflected in our financial performance – particularly within our Australian Retail and Commercial business – the actions taken in recent years to improve the structure of our bank has us well-placed to meet the industry’s challenges.\n4\nThese actions include returning our Institutional business to profitable growth as well as the progress we have made to simplify the products and services we offer our retail customers in Australia and New Zealand.\nWe started early on our simplification agenda and this work continued throughout the year. Simplification continues to underpin improvement across ANZ.\nA major milestone was the completion of the sale of our Life Insurance business in Australia to Zurich Financial Services Australia and we have also made significant progress in the sale of our Pensions & Investments business to IOOF. Subject to approval from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), we expect to complete this transaction in the first quarter of 2020.\nAnother highlight was the sale of some of our non-core assets outside of home markets, including our retail banking joint venture in Cambodia, our retail business in Papua New Guinea and our Life Insurance business in New Zealand. This continues the stronger focus on investments and resources in our core strategic retail and commercial businesses in Australia and New Zealand and our Institutional business in Asia Pacific.\nUnfortunately there have also been challenges. This year we have announced an additional charge of $682 million as a result of an increase in our provisions for remediation work. While our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Shayne Elliott addresses this in his CEO message, I want to assure shareholders that the Board understands the impact fixing the failures of the past has on shareholders and we are working proactively and as quickly as possible to remediate impacted customers.\nOur self-assessment\nDuring the year, APRA asked a range of banks, superannuation funds and insurance companies to take a closer look at their own behaviour and operations.\nThere has been some attention given to the fact ANZ has not released its self-assessment. APRA requested these self-assessments on a confidential basis to ensure institutions responded in a way that was full and frank. We have respected that request, noting particularly the fact that people contributed openly to the process on that basis and we will continue to do so. To assist those interested in our self-assessment we have published a summary which can be found on bluenotes at anz.com.\nThe self-assessment was a useful exercise where we identified many critical issues across culture, accountability and governance. As we outlined to APRA, the Board and executive team are determined to use this as an opportunity to deepen our self-awareness and to learn from our failings. Importantly, we do not see this as just a compliance measure but as an opportunity to make ANZ a more efficient, more sustainable bank.\nWe will be a simpler, less complex bank once we have implemented our road map for change.\nWe will have fewer products and more effective systems and processes. For customers, we will be easier to deal with and when things do go wrong we will be faster to resolve them.\nCritically, our regulator will recognise issues identified in our annual attestation are being resolved in a timelier manner and this will flow through to improvements in our comprehensive review.\nExecutive remuneration\nANZ recorded its ‘first strike’ last year when around 34% of shares were voted against our Remuneration Report. The Board took this result very seriously and shareholders will note there has been a significant differentiation this year in the remuneration awarded to our Disclosed Executives. Our Chair of the Human Resources Committee, Ilana Atlas, provides more detail in the Remuneration Report.\nYou will note our CEO despite a solid personal performance, has had his remuneration impacted by the broader performance of the Group. In fact, variable remuneration for our Disclosed Executives ranged between 0 and 74% of maximum opportunity. We also enhanced our approach to accountability and consequence management during the year and will continue to hold people to account who fail to meet our standards.\nCapital management\nWe continued our focus on capital efficiency this year by returning excess capital to shareholders as a result of our simplification agenda. We did this while also maintaining capital levels above APRA’s ‘unquestionably strong’ requirements. In the financial year of 2019 we reduced shares on issue by 42 million (equivalent of $1.1 billion) as part of our $3 billion buy-back. That program concluded in March 2019.\nOutlook\nWhile the Australian housing market is slowly recovering, we expect challenging trading conditions to continue for the foreseeable future.\nRecord low interest rates in Australia and global trade tensions will continue to place pressure on earnings while increased compliance and remediation costs will be closely managed.\nCompetition will also remain in focus with the recently announced inquiry into mortgage pricing. We have acknowledged we have not always done a good job in explaining our position and hope the inquiry enables the opportunity to provide facts on a complex matter.\nOn the regulatory front, both APRA and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand have announced proposals that could lift the amount of capital required to support our New Zealand subsidiary. The final impact of these changes depend on a number of factors. This includes the outcome of consultation, particularly the amount of capital required, the time allowed to achieve it, and the instruments we are permitted to use.\nManagement will maintain its focus on capital efficiency. However, our strong ongoing capital generation capacity will assist in meeting any additional capital requirements.\nDespite the industry’s challenges, I’m confident we have the team, the balance sheet and the oversight in place to execute effectively against a strategy that will benefit all our stakeholders. On behalf of the Board and myself, I thank our more than 39,000 people for their hard work in supporting our customers and our shareholders.\nDavid Gonski, AC CHAIRMAN\n5\nCEO’s message\nSHAYNE ELLIOTT\nThis has been a challenging year of slow economic growth, increased competition, regulatory change and global uncertainty.\nOur progress\nThe core of our strategy has not changed. Put simply, we will generate decent returns by improving the financial wellbeing of our customers.\nThis year we continued to focus on balance sheet strength, improve our culture, simplify the business and rebuild our team’s capabilities. In doing this, we significantly reduced the cost and risk of operating the bank despite the strong headwinds facing the sector.\nWe are determined to have the right people who listen, learn and adapt. We will put the best tools and insights into the hands of our customers and people. Importantly, we will concentrate our efforts on those particular things that add value to customers – and do them right the first time.\nThis means we must continue to simplify our business, improve our customer proposition and invest in innovations that deliver better customer outcomes and improve the efficiency of our operations.\nRetail and commercial in Australia had a difficult year. Increased remediation charges, intense competition and record low interest rates have had a significant impact on earnings.\n6\nWhile yet to flow through to the balance sheet, management actions and operational improvements have seen a steady recovery in home loan applications in recent months. These volume improvements are expected to be maintained into 2020.\nNew Zealand delivered a solid underlying result in a more competitive environment. As in Australia, compliance and remediation costs contributed to higher operating expenses, while a focus on operational efficiency offset inflation in business-as-usual expenses.\nThere are challenges ahead in New Zealand, particularly in relation to the amount of capital we may be required to hold. However, we are well-advanced in our preparations to manage these proposed impacts in an orderly way.\nInstitutional continued its transformation with a return to profitable growth. While macro conditions had an impact on financial performance in the second half, the business is now generating returns above our cost of capital that provides important diversification given the lower growth in our home markets.\nCustomer remediation\nThe Royal Commission highlighted many failures the Australian banks needed to quickly remedy. ANZ is not immune from this challenge.\nThis year we announced an additional charge of $682 million as a result of an increase in our provisions for remediation work. We know this is real money and has a real impact on shareholders. But we also know it’s important to fix the mistakes of the past and return money owed to customers as quickly as possible.\nWe are currently resolving identified fee or interest discrepancies with over 3.4 million Australia Retail and Commercial customers. To date our Responsible Banking team has remediated over one million customer accounts.\nIf there is a positive from this work, it is that much of the time and resources being invested in remediating our systems and processes will make us a better bank for our customers and shareholders. It means the mistakes of the past are unlikely to be repeated and when issues arise they will be easier to fix.\nCustomers and community\nOur purpose of shaping a world where people and communities thrive guides our decisions. An example of this is the program we have in place to proactively contact more than one million customers to help them get more value from our products and services, including those eligible for Centrelink or Veterans’ Affairs benefits or those with persistent credit card debt. This is to make sure customers are using the best products given their individual circumstances and that they are aware of all the options available.\nAnother issue we care about is providing affordable and sustainable housing for Australians and New Zealanders. We do this by encouraging investment in the sector – including our role leading the largest social bond issuance for housing in Australia.\nWe also know we have a role in enhancing environmental sustainability and we are focusing our efforts on energy, water and waste.\nWe have committed to fund and facilitate $50 billion by 2025 towards sustainable solutions for our customers, including initiatives that help improve environmental sustainability, increase access to affordable housing and promote financial wellbeing.\nThis is not philanthropy. It’s really good business for our customers and shareholders given the growth opportunities available in the sector. It’s also a business we are good at given our network and capabilities and an area we expect to grow rapidly in the coming years as the world grapples with environmental challenges.\nChanging how we reward our people\nThis year we introduced wide-ranging reforms to the way we pay people. Variable remuneration is now a smaller part of our people’s take-home pay and these reduced bonuses are determined by the overall performance of the bank.\nThis is not about paying our people less. It is an industry-leading initiative that will positively enhance our culture and become an important point of differentiation. It also addresses the negative impact an over-emphasis on individual bonuses within a bank can have on customers and the community.\nRedesigning how we reward our staff was one of the 16 key initiatives we announced as part of our initial response to the Royal Commission recommendations. As part of this, we also strengthened our accountability frameworks to ensure there are appropriate consequences for the small number of people who do not meet standards of behaviour or performance.\nFinally, despite this difficult environment, we have made good progress this year and I’d like to thank the more than 39,000 people who turn up for ANZ and work hard every day for our customers. I’m confident we have the right strategy and team to deliver great, sustainable results in the future for our customers, our shareholders and the community.\nShayne C Elliott CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n7\nAbout our business\nWe provide banking and financial products and services to around eight million individual and business customers, and operate in and across 33 markets.\nOur culture and values\nOur values are the foundation of how we work and are supported by our Code of Conduct. All employees and contractors must comply with the Code, which contains guiding principles and sets the standards for the way we do business at ANZ.\nWe care about:\nIntegrity\nCollaboration\nAccountability\nRespect\nExcellence\nOur purpose\nOur purpose is to help shape a world in which people and communities thrive. That means striving to create a balanced, sustainable society in which everyone can take part and build a better life.\nOne of the ways we are bringing our purpose to life is through helping to address complex issues that matter to society and are core to our business strategy. We are focusing our efforts on:\nThe United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) seek to respond to the world’s most pressing challenges. Business has an important role to play in helping achieve the SDGs. Recognising this we have identified our targets which are making a contribution to the achievement of the SDGs in our 2019 ESG Supplement available at anz.com/cs in December.\nfinancial wellbeing – improving the financial wellbeing of our customers, employees and the community by helping them make the most of their money throughout their lives;\nenvironmental sustainability – supporting household, business and financial practices that improve environmental sustainability; and\nhousing – improving the availability of suitable and affordable housing options for all Australians and New Zealanders.\nWe are contributing to these challenges by: developing innovative and responsible financial products and services; participating in relevant policy development and research; strengthening stakeholder partnerships; and harnessing the skills of our people. Fundamental to our approach is a commitment to fair and responsible banking – keeping pace with the expectations of our customers, employees and the community, behaving fairly and responsibly and maintaining high standards of conduct.\nThroughout this report we illustrate how we are embedding purpose into our business strategy, including through our Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) targets and performance objectives.\n8\nOur strategy\nOur strategy is focused on improving the financial wellbeing of our customers; having the right people who listen, learn and adapt; putting the best tools and insights into their hands; and focusing on those few things that really add value to customers and doing them right the first time.\nWe believe that the execution of our strategy will deliver decent returns for our shareholders, while achieving a balance between growth and return, short and long-term performance and financial and social impact.\nWithin our Institutional business we are creating an integrated trade, cash and markets experience, while developing and appropriately scaling our capabilities across geographies to deliver connectivity for our customers.\nWhile our focus has evolved over the past four years, the strategic imperatives remain the same: creating a simpler, better balanced bank; focusing our efforts where we can carve out a winning position; building a superior everyday experience to compete in the digital age; and driving a purpose and values led transformation.\nOur strategy has driven significant improvement in our business over the past four years. We have strengthened our balance sheet, improved our culture, simplified the business and rebuilt our people’s capabilities. In doing so we have reduced the costs and risks associated with running the bank.\nIn our Australian and New Zealand businesses we are: delivering improved customer outcomes, while rationalising our products and services; developing new compelling services and distribution options; and developing new initiatives to enhance our home owner and small business owner propositions.\nPurpose\nOur purpose is to help shape a world in which people and communities thrive\nStrategic Imperatives\nStrategy\nTarget Outcomes\nCreate a simpler, better capitalised, better balanced bank\nImproving the financial wellbeing of customers...\nImprove the financial wellbeing of our customers\nBuild a superior experience for our people and customers in order to compete in the digital age\n...looking to save for, buy and own a home\n...looking to start, buy and grow a business\n...looking to move capital and goods around the region\nDeliver decent returns for our shareholders -

Saver Plus is life changing, with research showing 87% of participants continue to save after they have completed the program.\n“It was so great to see the collaboration between everyone, regardless of who they worked for, because we all deliver the same program. To see the team feel so energised and motivated again was fantastic to witness,” said Cheryl Allen-Ankins, The Smith Family, Saver Plus Program Manager.\nPartnership has been the key to the continued success and impact of Saver Plus. The recent Saver Plus National Conference,\nLeft to right: Saver Plus Co-ordinators, Denise Clark, Graeme Grice and Cath Sweeney from The Smith Family at the Saver Plus National Conference\n13\nOur operating environment\nWe seek to anticipate and respond to the risks and opportunities arising in our external environment to ensure that we can continue to create value for our stakeholders. A summary of the issues influencing our strategy is outlined below.\nThese global trends present us with risks and opportunities\nRISKS\nOPPORTUNITIES\nLOWER CREDIT GROWTH ENVIRONMENT\nIncreasing competition and regulatory requirements places pressure on margins and customer volumes.\nNew approaches are needed to deliver products and services to our customers, together with efficient allocation of capital and resources to generate returns to shareholders.\nINCREASED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND STAKEHOLDER SCRUTINY\nTrust in the Australian and New Zealand banking industry has eroded over the past two years.\nIncreased regulatory expectations and focus places pressure on margins and customer volumes.\nCommunity concerns remain high following the Royal Commission in Australia and a number of regulatory developments in New Zealand. We can rebuild trust by transparently working with, and partnering with, government, regulators and NGOs to deliver improved customer outcomes.\nDIGITAL ADVANCEMENT AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE\nCompetition from existing and new competitors is increasing,\nBy improving our digital capabilities and investing in\nsupported by government policy, such as the consumer data right.\nWith the increase in digitisation, strong cyber security capability is critical.\nWith the increase in digitisation, strong cyber security capability is critical.\nDEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES\nDemand for home lending in Australia and New Zealand is impacted by a range of supply and demand factors largely outside of our control, including population growth, housing prices and dwelling construction.\nCommunity concerns about housing affordability remain high. We can help by partnering with business, government and NGOs to deliver innovative and practical housing solutions.\nENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE\nWe will continue to experience negative reputational impacts if we fail to raise standards across all our activities and take customer and societal impacts into consideration when making business decisions.\nBy continuing to focus on improving customer outcomes and strengthening our standards on issues such as environmental sustainability and human rights, we have an opportunity to differentiate ourselves from our peers.\nGLOBALISATION\nCommunity concerns about aspects of trade and investment\nWith increasing globalisation and the rise of Asia, we can support our customers to increase their cross-border trade and investment.\nWith increasing globalisation and the rise of Asia, we can support our customers to increase their cross-border trade and investment.\nIncreased trade and investment leads to higher incomes and employment for the communities in which ANZ operates.\nOur strategic imperatives assist us to respond positively to this environment and meet societal expectations\n14\nOur presence in Asia has helped Carman’s expand into overseas markets\nCUSTOMER STORY\nHelping our customers export to the world\nChances are if you have strolled down the supermarket cereal aisle recently you will have seen shelves stacked with boxes of Carman’s muesli.\nEstablished in 1992 by Carolyn Creswell with a modest $1,000, Carman’s is now a leader in breakfast and nutritious snacks, exporting to 35 countries.\nCarolyn views Carman’s relationship with ANZ similar to any other partnership.\nUsing our international footprint we have helped connect Carman’s to new markets, particularly in Asia, where there is an abundance of opportunity for Westernised products.\n“ANZ is a partner with us – the reality is ANZ is trying to make our business better. If our business is better, we are going to do more business with ANZ. We are all in this together.”\n“ANZ’s presence in Asia gives you introductions you would not have otherwise because of their connections. It is really impressive for an Australian bank to have that presence,” says Carolyn.\nThere is much ANZ can learn from Carman’s success, particularly given Carolyn puts that success down to a focus on the customer and having an engaged and passionate workforce – both central elements of ANZ’s own strategy.\nHaving had a banking relationship for more than 10 years, the journey for ANZ and Carman’s is centred on honesty, transparency and integrity, identifying the ways in which each partner can support the other.\nImage: Carolyn Creswell\n15\nBecoming a fairer and more responsible bank\nDuring this year we have continued to make changes to our culture, governance and accountability mechanisms to help improve customer outcomes and restore community trust.\nOur response to the Royal Commission\nAPRA Self-Assessment\nThe Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry (the Royal Commission) has had a profound impact on our organisation. We are determined to learn from our failures and build a bank that is worthy of the trust and respect of our customers and the community.\nIn late 2018, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) asked a range of financial services companies, including ANZ, to examine through a Self-Assessment Report their behaviours and operations in the wake of highly publicised misconduct in the sector.\nThe Commission’s report led us to further examine how we serve our customers. We identified eight lessons from our misconduct and failures to meet community standards and expectations. These lessons have informed our response to the ‘spirit and letter’ of the Royal Commission. We are now identifying measures that will allow us to be confident that these lessons have been acted on.\nWe submitted our Self-Assessment Report to APRA in November 2018, and have since developed a ‘roadmap’ to act on the themes raised in that report.\nWe identified five focus areas in which to concentrate our efforts to deliver better outcomes. These areas were identified both through the self-assessment as well as issues that were examined by the Royal Commission.\nOur first step was to identify which Commission recommendations we could quickly act on. This led to 16 initiatives to improve the treatment of our retail customers, small businesses and farmers in Australia. Some of the key commitments we have delivered on are:\nremoving overdrawn and dishonour fees on our Pensioner Advantage account (available to eligible recipients of Centrelink or Veterans’ Affairs pensions)\nFocus areas\nSimplification\nof our business, products and processes\nimproving our service to Indigenous customers in remote communities by setting up a dedicated phone service and giving them easier options to prove their identity\nCulture\nincluding the way we reward and recognise our people\npublishing principles to help family farming customers in financial distress\nGovernance and accountability\nincluding how we are held to account, and how we manage and execute change\npublishing principles on acting as a model litigant in disputes with our customers\nimplementing pay reforms that replace individual-based bonuses for most of our employees with an incentive based on the overall performance of the Group. In addition to progressing these 16 initiatives, Colin Neave, former Commonwealth Ombudsman and our first Customer Fairness Adviser (appointed in 2016), reviewed individual ANZ cases highlighted at the Royal Commission, taking action where appropriate to resolve matters.\nRemediation\nManagement of operational risk\nincluding expansion of our specialist customer remediation team\nreview and improvement of our operational risk framework\nThe majority of the recommendations in the Royal Commission final report require legislative change and we will continue to work with government as it implements those changes.\nExecutive Committee members have been assigned ‘ownership’ of each focus area and they are responsible for monitoring performance.\nWe have established a Royal Commission and Self-Assessment Oversight Group to oversee an integrated response to the Royal Commission and Self-Assessment.\nFurther details of our self-assessment can be found on bluenotes at anz.com.\n16\nOur customers\nConsistently delivering a positive customer experience enables us to create value for all of our stakeholders and is critical to our long-term success.\nWe seek to treat our customers fairly and responsibly, providing them with suitable and appropriate products and services, supported by strong data protection.\nLinks to 2019 Group Performance Framework\nWe have identified three customer segments where we believe we can best achieve this: home owners, business owners and companies that move capital and goods across the region.\nProviding suitable products and services\nWe have contacted more than 1 million of our retail and commercial customers, including customers who:\nare in receipt of eligible Centrelink or Veterans’ Affairs benefits to offer to help them move to a low-cost, basic bank account. Since June 2019, we have contacted 128,624 customers (via email or letters);\nWe are committed to improving the customer experience, as highlighted by the implementation of 16 initiatives in Australia in response to the Royal Commission. There were some challenges during the year including technology stability issues, and a period of underperformance in respect of assessment and approval times relative to peers in home lending. Institutional performance in key customer satisfaction/relationship strength surveys continued to be a highlight, along with strong digital engagement with customers.\nRefer to our Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 98 for further details.\nare experiencing persistent credit card debt;\nhave Interest Only home loans set to expire within 6 months, reminding them of the expiry period and notifying them of the options available at the end of the period;\nhave opened an ANZ Access Advantage account within the last 13–16 days, reminding them to credit their account with regular salary payments; and\nhave Progress Saver periodical payment or direct debit due to expire in the next month to remind them an automated credit can help them receive bonus interest on their account.\nCUSTOMER STORY Helping customers to get on top of credit card debt\nWe have been contacting credit card customers who are carrying persistent debt1 on their card to help them pay their debt faster.\nCustomers have been offered financial education, and the opportunity to close their card and repay the remaining debt at a lower interest rate. We have contacted 9,500 customers as at 30 September 2019.\nContinuing his current repayment behaviour, John would have taken more than 9 years to pay off the debt – assuming there was no further spending on the card – accruing at least $12,000 in interest over that time.\nEarlier this year we contacted John*, a long-term customer who has held a credit card facility with ANZ since 1976. John had a balance of $9,500 (on a $10,000 limit) and the entirety of the balance was on a cash advance interest rate of 21.74% per annum. John had not transacted on the card since 2016 and had been making payments only slightly above the minimum monthly repayment amount.\nAfter contacting John and explaining his options, John agreed to an instalment plan with an interest rate of 7% per annum. This will enable him to pay off the debt in five years or less, saving more than $10,000 in interest charges.\nThis program has been welcomed by many customers, including John who said, “I wish this had happened a long time ago … it’s such a relief.”\n1. Where for at least the last 12 months a credit card has over 80% of the credit utilised and the customer has been paying 2–3% of the outstanding balance on average each month. * Customer name has been changed.\n17\nOur customers continued\nHome owners\nWe are committed to fund and facilitate $1 billion of investment by 2023 to deliver around 3,200 more affordable, secure and sustainable homes to buy and rent in Australia.\nWe are developing a housing supply pipeline through direct engagement with our clients (new and existing), supporting innovative models to finance new supply. This includes:\njointly arranging the inaugural bond issue of $315 million for the Commonwealth’s National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (NHFIC), the largest social bond for housing in Australia; and\narranging the first wellbeing bonds in New Zealand for Housing New Zealand Corporation (NZ$500 million and NZ$600 million).\nWe have also established a Housing Virtual Fund (the Fund) enabling us to accommodate non-conforming risk aspects of new housing models. Emerging housing models generally come with increased risk for the developer, the bank and the consumer, preventing innovative models from being brought to market at scale. The Fund ensures that we have a comprehensive internal review process, allowing us to utilise all of our expertise in understanding and managing risk.\nSupport for first home buyers Our research shows that 64 percent of first home buyers are uncertain of what to do when it comes to buying their first property and they want someone they can trust to guide them through the process.1 In response, we are improving the skills of our frontline staff enabling them to provide tailored guidance and support to first home buyers. We have:\nprovided more than 3,300 frontline staff with Home Loan Coach training across Australia and New Zealand;\nMaking homes healthier in New Zealand\nAccording to research by the Building Research Association of New Zealand, about half of the homes built are unsuitable for the climate – they are not adequately insulated, have insufficient heating and are damp with visible signs of mould.\n“As New Zealand’s biggest home lender, housing is one area where we want to make a difference”, says Antonia Watson, Acting Chief Executive Officer, New Zealand.\nimproved our First Home Coach training in Australia – nearly 800 of our frontline staff have completed this training; and\nprovided Construction Coach training in New Zealand to support customers building or renovating a home – more than 220 frontline staff have received training.\nWe have also developed the most accurate property price predictor in the market to support customers in establishing the value of their future home.\nWe have set aside NZ$100 million so our customers can enjoy warmer, healthier homes while potentially also keeping energy costs down. Last year we began offering our home loan customers (both owner-occupiers and investors) an interest- free home loan top-up (up to NZ$5,000). More than 1,800 interest-free home loans (to the value of NZ$6.3 million) have been drawn down as at 30 September 2019. The top-up offer was also extended to heat pumps in July 2019.\nIn recognition of our commitment to this customer segment ANZ has been named Bank of The Year for First Home Buyers by Canstar for three years running (2017–2019).\nIn addition, in April 2019 we launched a Healthy Home Loan Package, that includes discounts to standard home loan rates, as well as fee waivers across a range of accounts, for customers buying, building or renovating a home to 6 Homestar or above, in New Zealand.\nIndustry insights During the year we have undertaken significant engagement with industry stakeholders to ensure that as an organisation we are directly linked to the housing policy agenda, offering market expertise to support government, customers and the community with relevant insights to inform decision-making.\nThirty four customers are now on the package (funds under management of NZ$11.7 million) and we are working to identify existing eligible customers to transition them across to the package.\nNot only are there health benefits associated with more energy efficient homes but occupants may also have more disposable income because they are paying lower power bills.\nWe have entered into a three-year partnership with CoreLogic to deliver a bi-annual housing affordability report. The report provides in-depth market analysis of the Australian housing market for both buyers and renters.\n“When every dollar counts, a lower home loan rate might swing the decision to go the extra mile on health and sustainability measures.” says Antonia.\n1.

To date our Australian Retail and Commercial Responsible Banking team has remediated over one million customer accounts5 and issued refunds of around $62 million.\nOne way in which we measure the experience of our customers is through Net Promoter Score. Net Promotor Score enables us to gauge whether we are meeting customer needs and expectations and how we are performing relative to peers. It is measured by asking customers how likely they are to recommend ANZ (on a 0–10 scale) and is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors (those who give a score of 0–6) from the percentage of promoters (those who give a 9 or 10).\nIn Wealth, the team has completed the first stage of a review to identify instances of inappropriate advice to customers. Over 7,000 advice cases, spanning more than a decade, were reviewed. In addition, the majority of remediation cases relating to ANZ Financial Planning ‘fee for no service’ have now been remediated.\nWith respect to our Australian and New Zealand Retail and Commercial customers we failed to meet our target to improve our Net Promoter Score relative to peers. Our Institutional ranking remains at number one in both Australia and New Zealand.\n$\nWealth has remediated nearly 26,000 cases in total and made payments of $95.2m as at 30 September 2019.\nOver the 12 months to 30 September 2019, the Responsible Banking team has increased the number of dedicated remediation resources working on large scale customer remediation matters from around 150 to around 275 people.\nManaging customer complaints Listening to our customers and responding to their complaints in a timely, transparent and fair way is key to maintaining their confidence and trust in us.\nThis year, both the Australian Financial Complaints Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission identified the need for significant improvement in our internal dispute resolution. High complaint volumes and lengthy delays in resolution were highlighted. We have established a detailed action plan which sets out the changes we need to make to improve our customers’ experience and we will keep stakeholders informed of our progress.\nSimilarly, the team within Wealth has expanded from around 120 to around 170 over the same time period and is projected to increase to around 200 by December 2019. Our New Zealand business also has almost 60 dedicated remediation resources. These additional resources, together with an increase in infrastructure and capability, are enabling us to refund impacted customers in a scalable and repeatable way.\nFor further information on our approach to complaints handling, complaint volumes and the role of our Customer Advocate refer to our 2019 ESG Supplement available at anz.com/cs in December.\nMore than 500 people throughout the Australian Retail and Commercial business are also working on a number of smaller customer remediations, fixes and investigations.\nWe are delivering an ongoing education program to share ‘lessons learnt’ and to highlight the impacts on customers when we fail to get it right. In creating a collective understanding of the root causes of our existing remediations, we continue to build a shared accountability for the prevention of future issues.\n1.

Of the 2.8 million customers using our ANZ app, 36 percent are using mobile banking only – up 30 percent this year, demonstrating the significant shift in how customers are choosing to engage with us.\nWe are implementing digital solutions to assist our customers to improve their financial wellbeing. We have developed new features in the ANZ app to help our customers work towards their financial objectives by setting and tracking goals. Currently in the pilot phase, new features include data-driven ‘nudges’ (messages) to customers via the app, with milestones and tips to help them meet their savings goals.\nThis digital banking evolution brings both opportunities and challenges for ANZ. We are tailoring our products and services to the changing habits of our customers, who have told us they want more flexibility in their banking. Our digital technology now makes it possible for our customers to serve themselves, anywhere, anytime and we are adapting the way we operate to accommodate this. Peak usage on the ANZ app is between 4–6pm, and even during our quietest time between 12–2am we are serving almost 100,000 customers.\nOf the 2.8 million customers using our ANZ app, 36 percent are using mobile banking only – up 30 percent this year\nWith increasing digitalisation, a strong cyber security capability is critical\nThe benefits of open banking\nAs our customers choose to move their banking to digital platforms we are focused on safeguarding their money and personal information. We have invested heavily in our cyber security capability, and are in a strong position to keep our systems, data and customers safe from the increasing pace, scale and sophistication of cyber-attacks.\nOpen banking regulation came into force at the start of July in Australia, supporting the sharing of generic product data with third parties, with the aim of making it easier for customers to compare products. The sharing of customer specific data will start in early 2020. This will enable consumers to access data about themselves (personal, account and transaction data) and share it with accredited third parties of their choice.\nAt the heart of open banking is trust in how open banking participants manage their customers’ data. We will continue to invest in our customers’ security and privacy, and apply our ethical principles to all data use and the outcomes that result.\nRecognising humans play a significant role in the security ‘ecosystem’, we are delivering comprehensive education programs for employees and customers, simplifying cyber security, and making it easier to understand and implement. This year we have developed workshops to help small businesses stay safe online, raised awareness of online scams and reached millions of customers through our campaign to help them protect their ‘virtual’ valuables. We are also helping to develop the cyber security curriculum for Australian high schools to ‘grow’ the next generation of cyber security workers.\nOur Data Ethics Principles put our customers’ interests first in how their data is collected, used and disclosed; and provide mechanisms for transparency and choice to help our customers understand and control their personal information.\nPromoting a culture where security is everyone’s business means we are better placed to protect our systems, data and our customers, and can actively contribute to digital innovation and the economic opportunities a secure online world offers.\nWe will uphold these principles as the open banking regime begins, ensuring our customers can request the sharing of their data, while also maintaining control over where and how their data is used.\nBiometric authentication protecting customer payments in Australia and New Zealand\n“The emerging Australian data economy, sustained by customer- driven data sharing frameworks, should give customers more control in sharing information with confidence. Also, it should create opportunities for business to leverage their expertise, experience and technology into new areas to serve their customers. Businesses that engage with the data sector will have the opportunity to offer better services, and a more precise product to meet customer needs. Their customers should have the opportunity to benefit from enhanced choice and convenience. The efficient use of data, in a secure ecosystem with a strong governance structure, could be tremendously beneficial for businesses and customers alike.”\nScott Farrell, Chair of Open Banking Review\nANZ was the first Australian bank to enable its customers to make high value payments (up to $25,000) via the ANZ app using their voice. Our voice ID technology allows customers to verify their identity using their voice, rather than a PIN or password.

New competitors built to make the most of digital innovations to serve customers are also having an impact.\nThe housing market activity is improving off the back of the lower interest rates, and the removal of investor and interest only lending caps, but it is too soon to call a recovery.\nBusinesses remain cautious and are taking a ‘wait and see’ approach with the economy. Investment continues to be below long- term averages.\nMomentum has returned in home lending with applications up 34% in the second half of 2019 (compared with the first half ), through improving turnaround times and greater clarity on lending policies, adjustments to lending caps and a major marketing campaign to restore confidence across our distribution channels. We are confident this will flow through to settlements.\nMore than half of our customers now bank digitally and the ANZ App has 2.8 million users making more than $380 million worth of transactions every day.\nOur ANZ Business Growth Program has created more than 1,300 jobs and participants have increased their revenue by 374% and profit by 461%.\nThrough our network and insights, our customers continue to succeed in Asia and more than 200 have joined us for delegations to China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam and Japan.\n2019 was a challenging year for Australia Retail and Commercial, impacted by continued margin erosion, lower average lending volumes (a combination of the external environment and ANZ conservative business settings) and reduction in fee Income.\nThe home loan portfolio, down 3%, was affected by slowing system credit growth, competition and more conservative home loan origination risk settings. Commercial Lending, also down 2%, was driven by lower volumes in Small Business Banking.\nCustomers grew by more than 130,000 in the year to 6.4 million, with 3.6 million customers now digitally active. Deposits also increased in 2019 to $208 billion, with Retail deposits up 1% and Commercial up 5%.\nProductivity initiatives, including workforce and branch optimisation delivered cost savings and offset increased investment spending.\nFinancial Performance for Australia Retail and Commercial is provided within the Our Performance section on pages 52 to 65.\n1.

Our focused strategy is delivering results, and we’re staying vigilant in managing risks relating to geopolitics, global trade and consumer retail trends.”\nMark Whelan – Group Executive Institutional\nExternal operating environment\nBusiness strategy outcomes\nPerformance\nMarket conditions have been challenging, particularly in the second half of this financial year. This is due to a combination of record low interest rates, high liquidity, low volatility, and heightened geopolitical tensions.\nInstitutional is focused on customers who value us, working within clear priority sectors, sharpening our geographic focus, simplifying products and technology and driving structural efficiencies.\nInstitutional continued to deliver the benefits of a simpler and more disciplined business in 2019, reporting an increase in Cash Profit and growth in the balance sheet. Net Loans and Advances were up 10% while customer deposits grew 6%.\nChina has been adapting to a slowing economy, while the inverted US Treasury yield curve sparked fears of a potential economic recession in the world’s largest economy.\nShifts in trade and supply chains due to the US-China trade war have had a positive impact on some markets, particularly in South-East Asia, where ANZ has a presence.\nANZ is also well prepared for Brexit with our European branch network and licensing arrangements meaning customers do not need to make changes or open new accounts in order to continue to bank with us in Europe.\nFollowing our decision to exit lower returning and non-core customer relationships, Institutional is now in the process of pivoting to responsible and disciplined growth. We have also maintained our focus on reducing costs and capital efficiency.\nThis has delivered leading market positions across key geographies (#1 Australia & NZ, #5 Asia) and #1 in overall relationship quality for the second year running.\nThe sale of Retail, Commercial and SME in Papua New Guinea completed in September 2019 has enabled the business to focus on Institutional banking. The sale of our stake in Royal Bank in Cambodia (completed in July 2019) was also an important step in our simplification strategy.\nGeographically, Australia, New Zealand and Asia Pacific, Europe & America all delivered profit growth, supported by strong customer revenue growth.\nTransaction Banking and Loans and Specialised Finance both increased revenue in 2019, up 8% and 7% respectively. Markets revenue was down marginally due to lower Balance Sheet revenue, while Franchise Sales and Franchise Trading both delivered stronger revenue outcomes.\nFocus on productivity contributed to another year of cost reductions, a result of lower full time equivalent staff, decrease in software amortisation and property efficiencies.\nCredit charges remained below long run trends.\nFinancial Performance Cash continuing1\nFinancial Performance for Institutional is provided within the Our Performance section on pages 52 to 65.\n% of Group Profit FY19\nCash proﬁt ($m)\nNet Loans & Advances ($b)\n28%\n2019\n1,828\n2019\n165\n2018\n1,480\n2018\n150\n% of Group Net Loans & Advances\nReturn on Avg.

Business and consumer confidence is down due to uncertainty in the international economic outlook. This has resulted in lower business investment and consumer spending. That has meant the historically low official cash rate environment has not provided the economic stimulus many had hoped for.\nThe level of regulatory scrutiny is increasing on all financial services entities in New Zealand and this is increasing compliance costs for the business.\nThe proposed RBNZ capital changes – which are intended to create a stronger and more robust banking industry and are expected to be made public in December 2019.\nWe continued to progress our strategy of simplifying the business and improving customer experience.\nThe OnePath Life insurance business sale was completed in November 2018, as well as other non-core ANZ New Zealand assets Paymark and ANZ Securities.\nFrontline sales incentives were removed in 2019 to give confidence to customers that any products and services they purchased were sold to them for the right reasons.\nIn striving to be the best bank to help Kiwis own homes, we developed a market leading proposition that includes a “healthy homes” package to better insulate and heat houses.\nThe Commercial and Agri, and Institutional parts of ANZ New Zealand had a major focus on environmental initiatives to assist customers in the economy.\nOur New Zealand business maintained a leading position in core banking products this year, with ~31% share of mortgages (August 2019), ~34% share of household deposits (August 2019) and ~24% share of KiwiSaver (June 2019).\nWhile the operating conditions were more challenging, Retail and Commercial both delivered balance sheet growth in 2019. Retail net loans and advances were up 4% (driven by Home Loan growth), and Commercial lending up 2%. Revenue for the division was however impacted by margin pressure from lower deposit margins and home loan mix changes.\nCustomer deposits grew 3% and customer numbers grew modestly to 2.4 million, of which 1.5 million customers are digitally active. Digital sales were up ~4% and now account for ~ 30% of all retail sales.\nWithin the Wealth unit, superannuation product Kiwisaver continued its strong growth, surpassing $14.5 billion in funds under management.\nFocus in recent years on more conservative lending standards, together with a benign credit environment, contributed to provision charges remaining low this year.\nFinancial Performance Cash continuing1\nFinancial Performance for New Zealand is provided within the Our Performance section on pages 52 to 65.\n% of Group Profit FY19\nCash proﬁt (NZDm)\nNet Loans & Advances (NZDb)\n22%\n2019\n1,479\n2019\n126\n2018\n1,655\n2018\n122\n% of Group Net Loans & Advances\nReturn on Avg.

Both a strong risk mindset and behaviours are embedded in our values, Code of Conduct and performance expectations, and we are committed to providing a safe environment in which all employees are empowered to ‘speak up’ and raise ideas or issues and concerns. Customer story icon\nCustomer story icon\nWe seek to understand and improve our culture on an ongoing basis and are continually improving the way we track and measure our progress. One way we do this is through our Enterprise Culture Steering Group, whose membership includes the CEO and other members of the Executive Committee, which meets twice a year and provides an opportunity for each Executive to present the cultural strengths and development areas of their business, and actions taken and planned to shift the culture.\nCulture assessments\nStakeholder icons\ncreating a diverse and inclusive workplace and building our people’s resilience and wellbeing.\nStakeholder icons\nWe are supported by a team of specialists in our Internal Audit group who undertake cultural assessments within the bank. These assessments assist our leaders to understand the culture within the business, how culture impacts the way we support customers and where culture could expose us to risk.\nLinks to 2019 Group Performance Framework Stakeholder icons How We Creat Value Icons Highlights during the year include: strengthening our Accountability and Consequence Framework; evolving our approach to measurement and governance of culture initiatives; redesigning and launching changes to how Stakeholder icons How We Creat Value Icons we manage and reward our people; solid progress in the investment in key skills for our future; launch of a digital How We Creat Value Icons learning platform; and a record level engagement survey result.\nThe assessments focus on identifying cultural themes, underlying factors and their impact to support the business to drive sustainable change toward ANZ’s desired culture. They incorporate a blend of quantitative data, primarily through an employee survey, as well as qualitative data through employee focus groups.\nMore than 20,000 employees have participated in culture assessments (since 2016)\nRefer to our Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 98 for further detail.\nOnce an assessment is completed, the implementation of actions to address cultural challenges is monitored, and the effectiveness of those actions in shifting towards the desired culture is reviewed.\nHow We Creat Value Icons\nHow We Creat Value Icons\n24\nStrengthening our risk culture\nDuring 2019 we have strengthened the way we deal with risk events through an enhanced Accountability and Consequence Framework, which is applicable to all of our people.\nNew Accountability and Consequence Principles set out when and how an accountability review will be conducted following a material risk or audit event, define the various categories of accountability (e.g. direct, indirect, collective) and provide guidelines for the relevant Group Executive to consider in determining appropriate consequences. Appropriate consequences should reflect the severity of the issue and may include, for example, one or more of the following: coaching, counselling, formal warnings, impacts to performance and remuneration outcomes, impacts on promotion, application of malus and ultimately termination of employment for the most serious issues.\nThe Consequence Review Group (CRG), chaired by the CEO, oversees the implementation and ongoing effectiveness of the Accountability and Consequence Framework, being cognisant of its impact on the culture of ANZ. The CRG reviews material risk and audit events and associated accountability and consequences. Our ongoing focus on accountability, consequences and driving a strong risk culture supports our customer commitment that when things go wrong, we fix them quickly and consistently hold executives to account where appropriate.\n‘Speak up’ culture We also seek to support a strong ‘speak up’ culture and ensure managers recognise exemplary risk and audit behaviours. The focus on ‘speak up’ is being supported through our New Ways of Leading (NWOL) that are aligned with our purpose and values. NWOL focuses on five behaviours relevant for all employees and imperative for people leaders: be curious, create shared clarity, empower people, connect with empathy and grow people selflessly. We are incorporating culture into leader-led team activities to facilitate open, purposeful conversations about our culture and practices and create a psychologically safe environment for employees to ‘speak up’. We continue to promote and raise employee awareness of the various ways that employees can ‘speak up’ including through initiatives such as the Whistleblower Awareness Week.\nWe have 39,060 full-time equivalent employees\nApplication of consequences In 2019 across the Group, 151 employees were terminated for breaches of our Code of Conduct. A further 516 employees received a formal disciplinary outcome, with managers required to apply impacts to their performance and remuneration outcomes as part of the annual review process.\nLeft to right: ANZ employees, Sewmee Samarasinghe and Kate London\nAt the senior leadership level, 30 current or former senior leaders (Senior Executives, Executives and senior managers) had a formal consequence applied in 2019 for Code of Conduct breaches or findings of accountability for a material event, or otherwise left the bank after an investigation had been initiated. The 30 employees represent ~ 1% of the senior leader population. The consequences applied included warnings, impacts to performance and/or remuneration outcomes and cessation of employment.\nSenior leader consequences in 20191\nPerformance and remuneration consequence\nFormal warnings\nNo longer employed\n1.\nIndividuals are included under all categories that are relevant meaning one individual may be reflected in multiple categories.\nChanges to remuneration\nA key focus this year has been the redesign of the way we financially reward and manage the performance of our people to better support our purpose, culture and values. The changes include rebalancing the way we pay our people so that variable remuneration is a smaller part of take home pay. For the majority of employees, variable remuneration will be based on Group performance only (i.e. no individual bonuses). These changes will apply from financial year 2020, and are more closely aligned to our desired culture, with increased focus on collaboration and team performance, as well as individual growth and development.\nWe are implementing the recommendations from Stephen Sedgwick’s ‘Retail Banking Remuneration Review’, which is focused on strengthening the alignment of retail bank incentives, sales practices and good customer outcomes. Recommendations that ANZ is delivering independently are 90% complete and will be fully implemented well ahead of the October 2020 deadline. We continue to work with industry to progress the recommendations for third parties and principles to underpin customer metrics. Management provides regular updates to the Board Human Resources Committee on progress.\n23\n12\n7\n25\nOur people continued\nBuilding workforce capability\nDiversity, inclusion and wellbeing\nWe are creating an environment where our people can learn and grow every day, helping us to build organisational agility and capability to remain competitive.\nWe are making progress on our priority to build an engaged, diverse and inclusive workforce. We want our workforce to reflect the communities we serve and believe that leveraging the diversity of our people will allow us to innovate and improve customer experience.\nWe are building the capabilities of our leaders through the introduction of a new leadership feedback survey giving our leaders tangible and actionable feedback on their strengths and development opportunities. We continue to track the demonstration of our NWOL behaviours and our people are telling us through the leadership and engagement surveys that they are seeing their leaders demonstrating improvements across all five behaviours.\nThis year our efforts have focused on enabling social and economic participation through providing employment opportunities for people from under-represented groups (including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, people with disability and refugees). Overall, we are broadly on-track to meet our target to recruit >1,000 people from these groups by the end of FY20, reaching 734 since 2016.\nEmployee engagement: 77% (up from 73% in 2018)1\nOur Spectrum Program is designed to offer employment opportunities to the autism community (sometimes described as part of the neurodivergent community) to build fulfilling careers in areas such as cyber security, coding and testing. This year we welcomed additional participants and nearly half of our original cohort moved into permanent ongoing employment with ANZ.\nIn addition, we are building the capabilities critical to delivering our strategy and to future-proofing our workforce, with a focus on investing in our pipeline of data and engineering talent with new roles and development opportunities in data analysis and science.\n?\n734 people employed from under-represented groups (since 2016)\nDuring the year we launched a new social learning platform – Our Way of Learning (OWL). Combining the functionality of a search engine and a social learning network, OWL offers employees free access to internal subject matter experts at ANZ and external content providers and user-generated content. OWL can be accessed by our people anywhere, anytime, and on any device.\nIn 2019 our people undertook almost 1.5 million hours of learning to increase their skills and capabilities, including self-directed learning through OWL.\nWe recognise that addressing the barriers preventing women from being fairly represented in senior roles is the key to closing our gender pay gap. We have a target in place to increase the representation of Women in Leadership to 34.1%2 by the end of the financial year 2020. This year representation has increased by 0.5% (up from 32% as at September 2018). Our progress is monitored monthly by the CEO and an Executive Committee.\nA summary of our policy position on Diversity and Inclusion can be found at anz.com/corporate governance.\nWe continue to make strong progress in supporting our people’s safety and wellbeing. Our Health and Safety policy, and associated programs, ensure that we provide an environment that enables employees to participate fully in the workplace and perform at their best. This year we have increased our focus on employee wellbeing, encompassing the areas of mental, physical, social and financial wellbeing.\nWe also provide opportunities for our people to contribute to the communities in which they live and work through our giving and volunteering programs.

When you buy a coffee from us you’re creating training and employment opportunities for marginalised young Victorians, helping create change in coffee farming communities around the world and saving tonnes of disposable paper cups going to landfill each year.” says Bec.\nSTREAT’s newest location is a café housed inside ANZ’s campus at 839 Collins Street in Melbourne.\nOur decision to partner with a social enterprise was a deliberate and considered one. With the opening of our new building this year there was an opportunity to look at the tendering process differently and select a partner that aligned directly with our own values and purpose.\nTrainees completing STREAT’s six month intensive program will spend two shifts a week at one of STREAT’s cafés. Bec says a strong rapport is built within the office environment over that time and corporate staff often ask about the trainees after they graduate.\nLeft to right: Ryan McDonald – Cafe Operations Manager, STREAT, Bec Scott OAM – STREAT co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, Elise Bennetts – Chief Relationship Officer, STREAT\n27\nOur community\nStrong relationships with our stakeholders and the broader community are critical to our success. Banking is based on trust and we are working hard to regain the community’s trust following the Royal Commission.\nIn 2019\n$\n42.4% of employees volunteered\nWe matched employee donations, collectively contributing over $2 million to charitable organisations\nEmployees volunteered 134,930 hours to community organisations\nImproving financial wellbeing – at the core of our strategy\nFinancial wellbeing contributes significantly to overall health and wellbeing, community connectedness and economic and social participation.\nOver many years we have invested in community programs, including Saver Plus and MoneyMinded, which have been proven to be an important part of the financial inclusion story for lower- income people. These programs have helped to build financial skills and resilience, develop active savings habits and improve overall financial wellbeing.\nOur financial inclusion program partnerships change lives\nSaver Plus – developed by Brotherhood of St Laurence and ANZ in 2003, program participants open an ANZ savings account, set a savings goal and save towards it regularly over 10 months while also attending MoneyMinded financial education sessions. On reaching their goal, savings are matched by ANZ dollar for dollar, up to $500, which must be spent on education.\nLinks to 2019 Group Performance Framework\nSince 2003, Saver Plus has reached over 43,600 lower-income participants and is expected to enable over $33 million of private sector funds to be invested in education by 2020.\nRegaining the trust of the community, government and other key stakeholders remains a major focus – our Reptrak community sentiment indicator improved over the 12 months to 58.8 but remains well below pre Royal Commission levels. We have retained high scores in a number of indices:\nMoneyMinded – this program supports adults with low levels of financial literacy and those on lower incomes across 21 markets, including Australia and New Zealand. It is delivered by community partner organisations in Australia and New Zealand, and a mix of community organisations and ANZ employees in Asia and the Pacific.\nCorporate Confidence Index (CCI)1: Score above peer average\nDow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI)2: 2019 score of 82 (2018: 83).

In that time it has reached over 79,500 participants and has been delivered in over 320 communities through either Australian Government- funded service providers or ANZ’s partners.\n1.

Stepping Stones is a micro- enterprise program offered to women who have migrant, refugee or asylum seeker backgrounds.\nOriginally from Lebanon, Taghrid arrived in Australia 10 years ago with her husband and one-year-old daughter. Keen to start her own business making special occasion cakes she took part in Stepping Stones, completing MoneyMinded in the process. MoneyMinded taught her about prioritising her spending and deciphering between ‘needs and wants’.\nMoneyMinded has also changed her attitude to money. Taghrid is careful with her money, but she is also finding alternatives so she and her family are not missing out on enjoying life.\n“I’m not cutting anything, I’m not suffering. But at the same time, if I need something, I have money to buy it in a different way. I cut my coffee, but I enrolled in a gym,” she said.\nShe also learned about the value of having ‘emergency money’. Since completing MoneyMinded Taghrid regularly transfers $50 into a specific savings account, ‘just like paying a bill’. With these savings she was able to buy a replacement car when hers broke down – before MoneyMinded she would have been without a car for several months.\nTaghrid has clear financial goals now too – a short-term goal of saving for materials for her business and a longer-term goal for her family to buy a home.\nImage: MoneyMinded participant Taghrid\n29\nOur community continued\nCommunity investment\nPublic policy debate\nIt is important that we are a part of the communities in which we operate, and we provide many opportunities for our people to get involved through our community programs – volunteering, funding and participating in community projects, or donating through workplace giving.\nWe seek to contribute constructively to policy debate and understand the perspectives of our community’s elected representatives, policy makers and regulators. We contribute to debate on business, economic, social and environmental issues affecting our customers and shareholders.\nThe strength of our relationships with partners in the not-for-profit sector is key to our ability to support the delivery of much needed services to the community. Many of our partners work in areas aligned to our priority areas of financial wellbeing, housing and environmental sustainability.\nWe work in a collaborative and open way as members of associations that have similar interests and approaches to ours.\nIn 2019 our key membership payments were:\nAustralian Banking Association\n$4,045,653\nBusiness Council of Australia\n$93,500\n$142.2 million in community investment1\nNew Zealand Bankers’ Association (NZD)\nBusiness New Zealand (NZD)\n$294,979\n$40,250\nWorkplace giving\nOur workplace giving program enables employees in Australia to make contributions to around 30 charity partners through regular pre-tax payroll deductions. This year we introduced ‘double matching’ – for every dollar donated by an employee (up to $5,000 per employee in a tax year) through the program, ANZ donates two dollars.\nPayment to the Australian Banking Association includes our annual fee as well as expenditure related to communications activity, contribution to the establishment of a not-for-profit Debt Repayment Service, industry initiatives in response to the Royal Commission’s work, and industry reform activity such as the new Banking Code of Practice.\nPublic policy advocacy\nOur employees in New Zealand and Fiji can also donate through payroll to their respective staff foundations (charitable trusts that provide small grants) and ANZ double matches donations.\nWe understand that some of our stakeholders are particularly interested in positions we hold on issues such as data security, privacy and climate change and our membership of industry associations that undertake advocacy on these issues.\nVolunteering\nOur Volunteer Leave Policy, which applies to permanent, regular and fixed-term employees provides for at least one day of paid volunteer leave each year.\nIt is not the role of any association to represent solely ANZ’s, nor any other single member’s view. It is also not possible for industry associations to obtain a consensus on every issue. There is sometimes disagreement amongst members about the final positions taken by industry associations and even if we do not agree with it, we will participate in discussions. From time to time, we may take positions on certain matters not supported by the relevant industry association. For example, ANZ was the first major bank to support a ‘last resort’ compensation scheme for victims of misconduct. Such a scheme is now public policy.\nSupplementary disclosures\nRefer to our 2019 ESG Supplement available at anz.com/cs in December for further disclosures, including historical data tables.\nWe place high importance on the ability to hold constructive dialogue within an association’s membership and we expect industry associations to be receptive to member feedback regarding their lobbying or advocacy approaches.\n1.

This is not about charitable works, it’s about bringing the full force of ANZ, one of the largest financial institutions in the country to bear; to have an impact and to shape the world for good.”\nA relatively new type of financing, social bonds are structured so the proceeds fund a social purpose. In this case, owning a NHFIC or HNZ bond is an indirect investment into Australia and New Zealand’s social and affordable housing sector. The return is based on the credit-worthiness of the borrower who is responsible for directing the financing to social causes, with an obligation to report accordingly.\nPartnering with NHFIC and HNZ allowed ANZ to join forces and draw on each organisation’s expertise in order to deliver better outcomes for a range of stakeholders.\nLeft to right: Nathan Dal Bon – Chief Executive Officer, National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation, Caryn Kakas – Head of Housing Strategy, Group Strategy, ANZ and Tessa Dann – Associate Director, Sustainable Finance, ANZ.\nAccess to housing has a huge impact on people’s ability to thrive socially and economically, as well as to feel secure and be part of a local community.\n31\nGovernance\nCorporate Governance Framework\nSHAREHOLDERS\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS\nAudit Committee\nEthics, Environment, Social and Governance Committee\nRisk Committee\nHuman Resources Committee\nDigital Business and Technology Committee\nNomination and Board Operations Committee\nBOARD RESERVED POWERS AND DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY POLICY\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\nGROUP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\n32\nANZ’s strong governance framework provides a solid structure for effective and responsible decision making within the organisation. The Board is responsible for the oversight of ANZ and its sound and prudent management, with specific duties as set out in its Charter available at anz.com/corporategovernance There are six principal Board Committees – the Audit Committee, the Ethics, Environment, Social and Governance Committee, the Risk Committee, the Human Resources Committee, the Digital Business and Technology Committee and the Nomination and Board Operations Committee.

The family started apple farming in 1888 and the business has since evolved into a premium supplier of organic apples, cider and spirits.\nOver the years they have faced many challenges, including bushfires and the collapse of Tasmania’s apple export industry in 1973 (the result of Britain joining the European Common Market). In response, Ian Smith, a third-generation orchardist, built controlled-atmosphere cool stores and began exporting to Asia in How We Creat Value Icons the 1980s.\nMore recently his son Andrew has converted the orchard into an organic farm, in the belief that growing food without the need for chemical fertilisers and pesticides is better for their land, their customers and the Tasmanian environment.\nWillie Smith’s has had a banking relationship with ANZ for more than 100 years. In June this year members of our Board and\nExecutive visited the cider production facilities and packing shed, meeting with the workers and learning about what matters to them and their local community.\n“I have worked hard to evolve Willie Smiths into a vertically integrated agribusiness in the last twenty years. The key ingredients have been innovation, hard work and good relationships. I feel confident and comfortable in our working relationship with ANZ,” said Andrew.\nSupporting the agricultural sector is an important part of ANZ’s history, and banking customers like Willie Smith’s aligns with our focus on helping our customers grow their business sustainably.\nImage: Andrew Smith\n43\nRisk management\nThe successful delivery of the bank’s strategy is dependent on sound risk management. All of the bank’s activities involve – to varying degrees – the analysis, evaluation, acceptance and management of risks or a combination of risks.\nSound risk management plays a critical role in positioning us to prepare for, and respond to, opportunities and challenges in our operating environment.\nOur progress\nThis year we have continued to strengthen our risk management capabilities, focusing on:\nOur Risk Management Framework\nThe Board is responsible for establishing and overseeing the Group’s risk management framework. The Board has delegated authority to the Board Risk Committee (BRC) to develop and monitor compliance with the Group’s risk management policies. The Committee reports regularly to the Board on its activities.\nCulture and conduct • We have initiated a programme of work to build out how we will measure, monitor and manage conduct risk to allow us to better understand and respond to the drivers of poor conduct. This has included introducing new accountability and consequence principles for employees found accountable for material failure and non-compliance as well as recognising positive risk behaviours in our annual performance and remuneration reviews.\nWe have raised employee awareness about our whistleblower processes and made it easier for them to ‘speak up’– including through initiatives such as the inaugural Whistleblower Awareness Week this year. Simplification • Investment has been made in our risk systems, including\nenhancing our data analytics to improve our ability to identify issues, and more swiftly understand the root causes.\nStandardisation and simplification of our wholesale risk practices and policies has helped significantly improve time responsiveness thereby delivering a better banker and customer experience.\nThe key pillars of the Group’s risk management framework include:\nthe Risk Appetite Statement (RAS), which sets out the Board’s expectations regarding the degree of risk that the Group is prepared to accept in pursuing its strategic objectives and its operating plan; and\nthe Risk Management Statement (RMS), which describes the Group’s strategy for managing risks and a summary of the key elements of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) that give effect to that strategy. The RMS includes: a description of each material risk; and an overview of how the RMF addresses each risk, with reference to the relevant policies, standards and procedures. It also includes information on how the Group identifies, measures, evaluates, monitors, reports and then either controls or mitigates material risks. The Group operates a Three Lines-of-Defence Model in regard to risk management that helps embed a culture where risk is everyone’s responsibility. The business – as the first line of defence – has day to day ownership of risks and controls and is accountable for identifying and managing its own risks. The Risk Function is the second line of defence, providing a strong and independent oversight of the work undertaken to manage the risk, as well as developing and maintaining the Risk Management Framework.\nNon-financial risk • We have redesigned our non-financial risk framework in response to feedback that it was too complex. Significant work has been undertaken to simplify our language around operational risk, consolidate our framework documentation, and clarify the requirements and roles and responsibilities of our staff.\nThe final line of defence is Internal Audit and includes independent assurance that evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of both first and second line risk management approaches.\nWe have established a Royal Commission and Self-Assessment Oversight Group to provide oversight of the integrated approach and plans to address the Self-Assessment focus areas and Royal Commission ‘lessons’. This includes, for example, commissioning and reviewing reports on progress in addressing the Self- Assessment focus areas, our 16 Royal Commission commitments and actions by government to respond to the Royal Commission.\n“ Strong risk management is a necessity if we are to anticipate and navigate ANZ through a changing environment.”\nKevin Corbally – Group Chief Risk Officer\nLinks to 2019 Group Performance Framework\nWe continue to operate in a dynamic and challenging external and regulatory environment placing significant demands on the Risk and Compliance function. There were no material breaches of our Group Risk Appetite Statement, and the number of adverse audits fell by a third with management demonstrating accountability for fixing issues in a timely and sustainable manner. While there were many positives from a risk perspective there were some non- financial risk shortcomings from a regulatory, customer and community perspective.\nRefer to our Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 98 for further detail.\n44\nFighting financial crime\nFinancial crime threats continue to evolve, as do the regulatory measures required to address them. In response we have:\nThe governance and oversight of risk, whilst embedded in day to day activities, is also the focus of committees and regular forums across the bank (see diagram below). The committees and forums discuss and monitor known and emerging risks, reviewing management plans and monitoring progress to address known issues.\ninvested heavily in capturing and\nunderstanding financial crime data and infrastructure, upgrading sanctions and fraud platforms;\nimplemented a network data analysis tool, improving our ability to collaborate with external parties to fight financial crime; and\nfocused on the growth and development of employees, developing a gap analysis tool to inform our thinking on the current and future capabilities required of our people to combat financial crime.\nThe risk landscape is continually evolving and we are therefore constantly reviewing issues to consider their materiality to the bank’s operations. Two risks we are currently seeking to understand further are:\nCyber security risk: while not new, the increasing reliance we have on information security systems to hold our data and our customers’ data requires us to continually invest in and test the adequacy of our safeguards against evolving cyber attacks and new technology. See page 20 for further detail,\nClimate change risk: the financial risks associated with climate change are subject to increasing prudential and regulatory oversight and are therefore an area of focus for us. See pages 48 to 49 for further detail on our approach to climate-related financial risks.\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS\nEXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ANZ’s most senior executives meet regularly to discuss performance and review shared initiatives\nConsequence Review Group\nKEY MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES\np u o r G\nCredit and Market Risk Committee\nCredit Ratings System Oversight Committee\nGroup Asset and Liability Committee\nCapital and Stress Testing Oversight Committee\nOperational Risk Executive Committee\nEthics and Responsible Business Committee\nInvestment Committee\nRoyal Commission and Self-Assessment Oversight Group\nn o i s i v D\ni\nModelling Ratings Working Groups and Usage Forums\nDivisional Initiatives Review Committees /Project Advisory Councils\nDivisional Risk Management Committees\nVarious Divisional Specific Management Committees\nOperational Risk Committee\nProduct Committee\nDivisional Consequence Review Groups\ny r t n u o C\nRegional or Country Risk Management Committees\nCountry Assets and Liabilities Committees\n45\nRisk management (continued)\nKey material risks\nThe material risks facing the group (as per the Group’s Risk Management Statement) and how these risks are managed, are summarised below:\nRisk Type\nDescription\nManaging the risk\nMost material issues icons\nMaterial ESG issues1\nCapital Adequacy Risk\nThe risk of loss arising from the Group failing to maintain the level of capital required by prudential regulators and other key stakeholders (shareholders, debt investors, depositors, rating agencies, etc.) to support ANZ’s consolidated operations and risk appetite.\nWe pursue an active approach to Capital Management through ongoing review, and Board approval, of the level and composition of our capital base against key policy objectives.\nMost material issues icons\nNew icons/infographics\nMost material issues icons\nCompliance Risk\nThe risk of failure to act in accordance with laws, regulations, industry standards and codes, internal policies and procedures and principles of good governance as applicable to the Group’s businesses.\nKey features of how we manage Compliance Risk as part of our Operational Risk framework include:\ncentralised management of key obligations, and emphasis on identifying changes in regulations and the Most material issues icons business environment, so as to enable us to proactively assess emerging compliance risks and implement robust reporting and certification processes.\ncentralised management of key obligations, and emphasis on identifying changes in regulations and the Most material issues icons business environment, so as to enable us to proactively assess emerging compliance risks and implement robust reporting and certification processes.\nNew icons/infographics\nrecognition of incident management as a separate element to enhance ANZ’s ability to identify, manage and report on incidents/breaches in a timely manner.

For detailed information see ‘ANZ 2019 climate- related financial disclosures’ on anz.com/annualreport.\nFeeding the results of our customer engagement into our assessments of individual customers and carbon-intensive portfolios, in particular the energy, transport, buildings and food, beverage and agricultural sectors\nEngaging with our customers on their transition plans\nThroughout 2019 we have analysed the carbon disclosures of over 80 of our largest emitting customers and engaged with 29 of these to support them to establish, and where appropriate, strengthen existing low carbon transition plans.\nThis engagement will inform the development of a model applicable to our broader customer base enabling us to encourage customers to improve the management and disclosure of their climate-related risks and opportunities.\nWithin each industry our customers have different starting points. Both through customer discussions and reviews of public disclosures we are developing a better understanding of our customers’ preparation for, and management of, their most likely climate-related risks and opportunities. Insights we have gained from these customer conversations include:\nEnergy\nTransport\nBuildings\nFood, beverage and agriculture\nEnergy: our engagement in this sector is initially focused on customers with thermal coal operations. Some customers see continuing strong demand for high-quality, low-cost Australian thermal coal that will be used in recently built or planned high efficiency, lower emissions (HELE) plants across Asia; their strategy is focused on developing high quality thermal coal assets and they are committed to improving their external disclosures. Other customers have undertaken scenario analysis (aligned with TCFD recommendations), revealing that some of their commodities perform worst under a low-carbon transition; in response they are directing limited expenditure to thermal coal and most of this is in maintenance capital rather than expansion. Some companies are also starting to work with their suppliers and customers to seek to reduce the emissions associated with the use of their mining commodities, ie ‘Scope 3’ emissions.\nTransport: a significant customer has ambitious plans to expand their electric vehicle fleet in Australia and is building a new distribution centre that will integrate rooftop solar and electric vehicle charging bays. They also plan to enter a renewable energy power purchase agreement (PPA) to lower their carbon footprint and shield themselves from price volatility.\nBuildings: a number of customers have established net-zero carbon targets that will be achieved largely through improved energy efficiency and onsite solar installations, setting time bound goals to achieve this by 2030.\nFood, beverage and agriculture: for many of our agribusiness and food producers, the physical risks of climate change (e.g., water availability and supply) represent the most material and immediate risk to their business, rather than transition risks. We have observed these customers are increasingly focused on managing climate-related risks by committing to reduce or remove deforestation from their operations and supply chains.\n48\nOur progress on the TCFD\nTCFD theme Our progress to date\nGovernance\nBoard Risk Committee oversees management of\nclimate-related risks\nBoard Ethics, Environment, Social and Governance Committee approves climate-related objectives, goals and targets\nEthics and Responsible Business Committee (executive management) oversees our approach to sustainability and reviews climate-related risks\nStrategy\nANZ’s Climate Change Statement (available on anz.com) reaffirms support for the Paris Agreement goals and transition to a net-zero carbon economy\nManaging the net-zero carbon transition focuses on an orderly and just transition that gives careful consideration to the impacts on communities\nParticipation in a United Nations Environment Program Finance Industry (UNEP FI) working group on TCFD scenario analysis that issued recommendations and methods to assess portfolio transition and physical risks\nLow carbon products and services within our Institutional business focused on climate-related opportunities\nAnalysis of flood-related risks for our home loan portfolio in a major regional location of Australia\nTest-pilot of socio-economic indicators showing financial resilience of home loan customers with respect to flood risk\nRisk management\nClimate change risk added to Group and Institutional Risk Appetite Statements\nClimate change identified as a Principal Risk and Uncertainty in our UK Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTR) Submission\nGuidelines and training provided to over 1,000 of our Institutional bankers on customers’ transition plan discussions\nEnhanced financial analysis and stronger credit approval terms applied to agricultural property purchases in regions of low average rainfall or measured variability\nNew agribusiness customers assessed for financial resilience and understanding of rainfall and climate trends in their area, and water budgets considered if irrigating\nMetrics and targets\nSupport 100 of our largest emitting customers1 to establish or strengthen low carbon transition plans by 2021, with metrics developed to track progress\nExceeded our 5-year $15 billion target to fund and facilitate low carbon and environmentally sustainable solutions\nPower Purchase Agreement to increase renewable energy use in our Australian operations\nOngoing emissions reduction targets for ANZ energy use aligned with the Paris Agreement goals\n1.\nIn the energy, transport, buildings and food, beverage and agricultural sectors.\nFocus areas – 2020/21\nAlign with regulatory\nguidance on climate-related risk governance, including stress testing of selected portfolios\nConsider extending scenario\nanalysis to incorporate bushfire, flood and other risks relating to retail customers\nPossible extension of\nemerging environmental and climate-related risks to other segments of the home loan portfolio\nInclude climate risk reference in agriculture related lending guidance documents used by our front line bankers\nEncouraging customers to develop and disclose their transition plans in key sectors energy, transport, buildings and food, beverage and agriculture\nCustomer engagement to identify customer or sector-specific transition or physical risks\nComplete transition plan engagement with high emitting customers and consider how to integrate into customer assessments\nNew 6-year $50 billion target to fund and facilitate sustainable solutions\nNew metrics for measuring impact of our progress on environmental sustainability\nNew target to procure 100% renewable electricity for ANZ’s operations by 2025\nBeyond 2020 vision\nAn enhanced risk\nmanagement framework that is responsive to climate change, and meets financial regulators’ requirements\nANZ business strategy more closely aligned to a resilient and sustainable economy that supports the Paris Agreement goals and Sustainable Development Goals\nIntegrate assessment of climate-related risks into our Group risk management framework\nStandard discussions with business customers include climate-related risks and opportunities\nAssessment of customer transition plans part of standard lending decisions and portfolio analysis\nMonitor industry\nstandards for lending aligned with the Paris Agreement goals\nReduce ANZ’s\noperational emissions in line with the decarbonisation trajectory of the Paris Agreement goals\n49\n$\nCUSTOMER STORY Sustainable finance market continues to grow\nFollowing the growth of green bonds in the past three to four years, the Australian and New Zealand sustainable finance market continues to accelerate with the emergence of loans in both green and sustainability-linked formats.\nThese loans are differentiated by how the proceeds are used. Green loans require borrowers to invest in ‘green’ assets such as green buildings, renewable energy or low carbon transport projects. Sustainability-linked loans can be used for general corporate purposes with pricing designed to incentivise improved sustainability performance – for example, reducing emissions and improving employee wellbeing.\nIn the past year, ANZ has arranged and funded the first ever sustainability linked loan in Australia for Adelaide Airport, and the first Climate Bonds Initiative certified green loan in Australia for Investa Commercial Property Fund.\nWe also acted as joint sustainability co-ordinator and bookrunner on a $1.4 billion sustainability-linked loan for Sydney Airport – the first syndicated facility of its kind in Australia as well as the largest in Asia Pacific and the airport sector to date. Pricing of the loan is attached to Sydney Airport’s ESG performance, as measured by an independent third party. Sustainability initiatives include investment in electric vehicles, an ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025 and cutting carbon emissions per passenger by 50 percent from 2010 levels by 2025.\nIn a first for the New Zealand market, we also led the successful completion of a NZ$50 million sustainability-linked loan for dairy company Synlait Milk Ltd.\n“Linking our financial arrangements to our ESG performance made perfect sense”, said Nigel Greenwood, Synlait Chief Financial Officer. “It reinforces to our shareholders and stakeholders that we are committed to continuously improving our performance and disclosure, and aligns with our company purpose.”\nANZ expects companies will become more receptive to these types of sustainable finance products as climate change and sustainable development move into the fore of their corporate strategies and risk assessment.\nImages supplied by Synlait Milk Ltd\n50\nIn a first for New Zealand, we led the completion of a NZ$50 million sustainability linked loan for dairy company, Synlait Milk Ltd\n51\n52\nOUR PERFORMANCE (continued)\nOUR PERFORMANCE (continued)\nPerformance Overview\nGROUP PERFORMANCE\nGROUP PERFORMANCE The results of the Group’s operations and financial position are set out on pages 52-64.

ANZ includes the impact on the re-measurement of insurance contracts attributable to changes in market discount rates as an adjustment to statutory profit to remove the volatility attributable to changes in market interest rates which reverts to zero over the life of insurance contracts. With the sale completion of the OnePath Life (NZ) Ltd business, the 2019 financial year includes the reversal of life-to-date cash profit adjustments on the revaluation of policy liabilities sold increasing cash profit by $81 million. The Group enters into economic hedges to manage its interest rate and foreign exchange risk which, in accordance with accounting standards, result in fair value gains and losses being recognised within the Income Statement. ANZ removes the fair value adjustments from cash profit since the profit or loss resulting from the hedge transactions will reverse over time to match with the profit or loss from the economically hedged item as part of cash profit. This includes gains and losses arising from approved classes of derivatives not designated in accounting hedge relationships but which are considered to be economic hedges, including hedges of foreign currency debt issuances and foreign exchange denominated revenue and expense streams, primarily NZD and USD (and USD correlated), as well as ineffectiveness from designated accounting hedges. ANZ entered into a series of structured credit intermediation trades prior to the Global Financial Crisis with eight US financial guarantors. This involved selling credit default swaps (CDSs) as protection over specific debt structures and purchasing CDS protection over the same structures. ANZ has subsequently exited its positions with six US financial guarantors. The remaining two portfolios with a $0.3 billion notional value are being monitored with a view to reducing the exposures when ANZ deems it cost effective relative to the perceived risk associated with a specific trade or counterparty. On 3 January 2017, The Group announced that it had agreed to sell its 20% stake in Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank (SRCB). The impact of SRCB has been treated as an adjustment between statutory profit to cash profit. The rationale being the loss on reclassification to held for sale was expected to be largely offset by the release of reserve gains on sale completion within the 2017 year. The transaction was subsequently completed in the 2018 full year, and the entire impact of the transaction was recognised in cash profit.\n1.

The lower net interest margin reflects growth in lower margin Markets Balance Sheet activities, higher proportionate growth in the lower Institutional business, customer switching to principal and interest in Australia home loans, deposit margin compression and lower earnings on capital, partially offset by the impact of home loans repricing. The increase in average interest earning assets reflects growth in Institutional banking portfolios and home loan growth in the New Zealand division.\nOther operating income decreased $163 million (-3%) largely as the result of net divestment impacts of $198 million, a $120 million decrease in net fee and commission income, and $130 million decrease primarily in other income attributable to realised losses on economic hedges against foreign currency denominated revenue streams (which offset favourable foreign currency translations elsewhere in the Group) and a reduction in income from the lenders mortgage insurance business. This was partially offset by higher Markets other operating income of $154 million, a $79 million increase in share of associate’s profit and a $52 million decrease in customer remediation within other operating income.\nOperating expenses decreased $330 million (-4%) primarily due to an accelerated software amortisation charge in the prior period of $251 million, lower restructuring expenses of $150 million, a reduction in expenses following the sale of OnePath Life (NZ) and Asia Retail and Wealth businesses of $60 million, lower Royal Commission legal costs of $40 million and lower FTE. This was partially offset by higher customer remediation of $182 million within operating expenses, inflation, the impact of foreign currency translation and regulatory compliance spend in New Zealand.\nCredit impairment charges increased $107 million (+16%) largely due to higher collectively assessed credit impairment charges, primarily as a result of the prior period benefitting from the release of temporary economic overlays and a greater number of customer upgrades.\n1.

Key drivers:\nPersonnel expenses increased $7 million (0%) largely driven by higher regulatory compliance spend in the New Zealand division, higher employee leave provisions, wage inflation and the impact of insourcing technology services. This was offset by lower FTE, lower personnel expenses following the sale of OnePath Life (NZ) and the Asia Retail and Wealth businesses ($33 million) and lower customer remediation ($58 million).\nPremises expenses decreased $16 million (-2%) primarily driven by the consolidation of our property footprint.\nTechnology expenses (excluding personnel) decreased $365 million (-19%) largely due to an accelerated amortisation charge in the prior period ($251 million) and the insourcing of technology services.\nRestructuring expenses decreased $150 million (-66%) due to higher spend in the prior period associated with the move to agile ways of working in the Australian Retail and Commercial division and technology function.\nOther expenses increased $194 million (+11%) largely due to higher customer remediation ($240 million), partially offset by lower expenses following the sale of OnePath Life (NZ) and Asia Retail and Wealth businesses ($26 million) and a reduction in Royal Commission legal costs ($40 million).\nOPERATING EXPENSES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ($M) OPERATING EXPENSES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ($M)\n1,706\n1,900\nPersonnel expenses\n227\n77\nPremises expenses\n2019\n2018\nTechnology expenses\nRestructuring expenses\n4,765\n1,534\n1,899\n4,758\nOther expenses\n795\n811\nCredit impairment1\n2019\n2018\nMovt\n(85) 773 688 2,139 337.6 3,443 43.0% 0.75%\nlarge 1% 16% -5% 6% 18%\nCollectively assessed credit impairment charge/(release) ($m) Individually assessed credit impairment charge ($m) Credit impairment charge ($m) Gross impaired assets ($m)2 Credit risk weighted assets ($b) Total allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) ($m) Individually assessed as % of gross impaired assets Collectively assessed as % of credit risk weighted assets3\n17 778 795 2,029 358.1 4,190 40.1% 0.94%\nThe collectively assessed credit impairment charge of $102 million was primarily driven by a $55 million increase in the New Zealand division and a $30 million increase in the Institutional division. The increase in the New Zealand division was primarily due to release of a temporary economic overlay in 2018, followed by a new temporary management overlay in 2019. The increase in the Institutional division was due to a greater number of customer upgrades in the prior period.\n1. Information has been presented on a cash profit from continuing operations basis.

In 2019, ANZ implemented a more market responsive collateral valuation methodology for the home loan portfolio in Australia which increased the number of home loans being classified as impaired rather than past due.

This was partially offset by an increase in the Australia Retail and Commercial division ($57 million) primarily driven by a number of single name impaired loans in the Commercial portfolio.

Net interest margin decreased as a result of home loan mix changes and higher discounting, the impact of the official cash rate decreases on low-rate deposits, regulatory impact on credit card pricing and higher customer remediation, partially offset by home loans re-pricing. Other operating income decreased as the result of higher customer remediation, and lower fee income due to the removal of fees and lower volumes. Operating expenses were flat with higher inflation, higher compliance costs and increased technology infrastructure spend offset by productivity initiatives including workforce and branch optimisation. Credit impairment charges increased primarily due to an increase in collectively assessed credit impairment as a result of a weakening Australian economic outlook, partially offset by a higher recoveries and write-backs.\nInstitutional\nLending volumes grew across all Institutional businesses. Customer deposits grew in Markets and Transaction Banking. Net interest margin decreased due to a reduction in lending margins, partially offset by higher deposit margins. Other operating income increased as a result of higher Markets income across all businesses. Operating expenses decreased due to a reduction in FTE and related costs, and lower ongoing software amortisation charges, partially offset by inflation. Credit impairment charges increased primarily due to an increase in individually assessed impairment charges driven by lower write-backs and recoveries, and an increase in collectively assessed impairment charges as a result of a greater number of customer upgrades in the prior period.\nNew Zealand\nLending and customer deposit volumes grew across all portfolios and funds under management increased during the period. Net interest margin decreased as a result of compressed deposit margins and home loan mix changes. Operating income decreased primarily due to the loss of income as the result of the OnePath Life (NZ) divestment, and an one-off insurance recovery in the prior period. Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher regulatory compliance spend, partly offset by the OnePath Life (NZ) divestment. Credit impairment charges increased primarily due to an increase in individually assessed impairment charges driven by lower write-backs and recoveries, and increase in collectively assessed impairment charges in Commercial driven by the release of an Agri economic cycle adjustment in 2018 followed by a new temporary overlay in 2019.\nPacific\nOperating income for the Pacific division was broadly in line with the prior year. Costs were higher largely due to customer remediation. Credit impairment charges were not significant for the 2019 financial year.\nTSO and Group Centre\nThe 2019 financial year included the gain on sale of OnePath Life (NZ), Paymark, Cambodia JV and PNG Retail, Commercial and SME. The 2018 financial year included the gain on sale of MCC, loss on sale of SRCB, the loss on reclassification of assets and liabilities to held for sale for Cambodia JV, OPL NZ, and PNG Retail, Commercial and SME, Royal Commission legal costs, and higher restructuring costs.\n1. Information has been presented on a cash profit from continuing operations basis. Discontinued operations are detailed on page 61.\n60\n60 ANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nOUR PERFORMANCE (continued)\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nThe financial results of the Wealth Australia businesses being divested and associated Group reclassification and consolidation impacts are treated as discontinued operations from a financial reporting perspective. These businesses qualify as discontinued operations, a subset of assets and liabilities held for sale, as they represent a major line of business.\nThe comparative Group Income Statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income have been restated to show discontinued operations separately from continuing operations in a separate line item ‘Profit/(Loss) from discontinued operations’.\nSale to IOOF Holdings Limited (IOOF)\nOn 17 October 2017, the Group announced it had agreed to sell its OnePath P&I and ADGs businesses to IOOF. The aligned dealer groups business consists of ADGs that operate under their own Australian Financial Services licences. The sale of the ADGs completed on 1 October 2018. On 17 October 2019 the Group announced it had agreed a revised sale price for its OnePath P&I business and ADG to IOOF of $850 million, being a $125 million reduction from the original sale price of $975 million announced in October 2017. The new price of $850 million, includes approximately $25 million that ANZ has already received for the sale of ADGs in October 2018. The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements. Subject to APRA approval the Group expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. The impact of the reduction in price has been reflected in the 2019 financial results.\nSale to Zurich Financial Services Australia (Zurich)\nOn 12 December 2017, ANZ announced that it had agreed to the sale of its life insurance business to Zurich and regulatory approval was obtained on 10 October 2018. The transaction was completed on 31 May 2019.\nIncluded in the ‘Cash loss from discontinued operations’ is:\nA $23 million loss ($81 million loss after tax) was recognised in the 2019 financial year. This is attributable to sale related adjustments and write-downs, the reversal of the life-to-date cash profit adjustments on the revaluation of policy liabilities sold to Zurich, partially offset by the recycling of gains previously deferred in equity reserves on sale completion. A $632 million loss (pre and post-tax) was recognised on the reclassification of Wealth Australia businesses to held for sale in the 2018 financial year; and\nCustomer remediation which includes provisions for expected refunds to customers and related remediation costs associated with inappropriate advice or services not provided in the pensions and investments and life insurance businesses. An amount of $241 million pre-tax, $207 million post tax was recognised in the 2019 financial year (2018: $181m pre-tax, $127 million post-tax).\nANZ’s lenders mortgage insurance, share investing, general insurance distribution and financial planning businesses which were previously part of the continuing operations of Wealth Australia now form part of the Australia Retail and Commercial division (previously named Australia division) and Wealth Australia ceases to exist as a continuing division.\nExplanation of adjustments between statutory profit and cash profit\nTreasury shares adjustment\nANZ shares held by the Group in Wealth Australia discontinued operations are deemed to be Treasury shares for accounting purposes. Dividends and realised and unrealised gains and losses from these shares are reversed as they are not permitted to be recognised as income for statutory reporting purposes. In deriving cash profit, these earnings are included to ensure there is no asymmetrical impact on the Group’s profits because the Treasury shares are held to support policy liabilities which are revalued through the Income Statement. With the sale completion of the life insurance business to Zurich, there are no further ANZ shares held by the Group in discontinued operations (2018: 15.5 million shares).\nRevaluation of policy liabilities\nWhen calculating policy liabilities, the projected future cash flows on insurance contracts are discounted to reflect the present value of the obligation, with the impact of changes in the market discount rate in each period being reflected in the Income Statement. ANZ includes the impact on the re-measurement of the insurance contract attributable to changes in market discount rates as an adjustment to statutory profit to remove the volatility attributable to changes in market interest rates which reverts to zero over the life of the insurance contract. With the sale completion of the life insurance business to Zurich, the 2019 financial year includes the reversal of the life-to-date cash profit adjustments on the revaluation of policy liabilities sold, reducing cash profit by $15 million.\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\nStatutory profit/(loss) from discontinued operations\n(343)\n(695)\nAdjustments between statutory profit and cash profit\n34\n13\nTreasury shares adjustment Revaluation of policy liabilities\n(11) 45\n7 6\nCash profit/(loss) from discontinued operations\n(309)\n(682)\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT 61\n61\nOUR PERFORMANCE (continued)\nFINANCIAL POSITION OF THE GROUP – INCLUDING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nCondensed balance sheet\nAs at\n2019 $b\n2018 $b\nMovt\nAssets\nCash / Settlement balances owed to ANZ / Collateral paid Trading and investment securities/available-for-sale assets 1 Derivative financial instruments\n100.3\n126.9\n120.7\n98.0\n112.0\n68.4\n2%\n13%\n76%\nNet loans and advances\n615.3\n604.5\n2%\nAssets held for sale\n1.8\n45.2\n96%\nOther\n16.1\n15.1\n7%\nTotal assets\n981.1\n943.2\n4%\nLiabilities\nSettlement balances owed by ANZ / Collateral received\n18.8\n18.3\n3%\nDeposits and other borrowings\n637.7\n618.2\n3%\nDerivative financial instruments\n121.0\n69.7\n74%\nDebt Issuances\n129.7\n121.2\n7%\nLiabilities held for sale\n2.1\n47.2\n96%\nOther\n11.0\n9.2\n20%\nTotal liabilities\n920.3\n883.8\n4%\nTotal equity\n60.8\n59.4\n2%\n1.\nOn adoption of AASB 9 on 1 October 2018, the classification and measurement of financial assets were revised.

The Board acknowledges the impact this has on shareholders and this has impacted remuneration outcomes.\nAs you may know, ANZ recorded a ‘first strike’ last year when around a third of shares were voted against our Remuneration Report. While two thirds of shares voted in favour, the Board took this result very seriously and has actively sought feedback from both our institutional and retail shareholders.\nWe have provided additional information in this year’s report to help shareholders better understand the steps we have taken as a Board to respond to the concerns raised. This includes how executive performance has been assessed as well as improvements to accountability and consequence management.\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nExecutive outcomes\nThere has been significant differentiation this year in the remuneration awarded to our executives, reflecting different levels of performance among our most senior leaders.\nOur Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Shayne Elliott, had a solid year where he demonstrated strong leadership in dealing with the challenges facing ANZ and the industry. However, as CEO he is accountable for the overall performance of the Group and as a result was awarded Annual Variable Remuneration (AVR) of 48% of his maximum opportunity.\nThe Variable Remuneration (VR) outcomes for our Disclosed Executives ranged between 0% and 74% of maximum opportunity, demonstrating the ‘at-risk’ nature of their remuneration.\nAs outlined in the Chief Executive’s report, we have also introduced wide-ranging reforms for financial year 2020 as to how we pay our people below our Disclosed Executives, replacing individual bonuses for the vast majority of employees with an incentive based on the overall performance of the Group.\nThis is an industry leading initiative that addresses many of the concerns about ‘bonus culture’ raised in the final report of the Royal Commission.\nThis year, we also strengthened the way we deal with material risks with an enhanced Accountability and Consequence Framework. 151 employees were terminated for breaches of our Code of Conduct with a further 516 employees having their performance and remuneration outcomes impacted.\nNext steps\nYour Board is committed to putting remuneration frameworks in place to help foster a culture of trust, integrity and ethical decision making.\nDuring 2020, we will undertake a comprehensive review of executive remuneration against Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration recommendations from our prudential regulator as well as the external environment.\nWe will also consult with our stakeholders so that the way we reward our people is aligned with our culture and values as well as customer, shareholder and community standards.\nOn behalf of the Board, I invite you to consider our Remuneration Report which will be presented to shareholders for adoption at the 2019 Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Brisbane.\nIlana Atlas CHAIR – HUMAN RESOURCES (HR) COMMITTEE\nContents\n1.\nBOARD RESPONSE TO FEEDBACK PROVIDED IN RELATION TO THE 2018 REMUNERATION REPORT\n2.\nWHO IS COVERED BY THIS REPORT\n3. 2019 REMUNERATION OUTCOMES AT A GLANCE\n4.

BOARD RESPONSE TO FEEDBACK PROVIDED IN RELATION TO THE 2018 REMUNERATION REPORT\nAt the AGM in 2018, while two thirds of shares voted were cast in favour of the Remuneration Report, one third were cast against and so ANZ recorded what is termed a ‘first strike’. The Board took this outcome very seriously and sought feedback from both our institutional and retail shareholders. A summary of the key feedback received and changes made this year is provided below.\nSUMMARY\nQuestions around whether variable remuneration is sufficiently variable and genuinely at risk. This was a particular focus in 2018 given the impact on ANZ of the Royal Commission and where ANZ recognised substantial customer remediation costs.\nThe Board has focused on ensuring that the 2019 variable remuneration awards appropriately reflect individual and overall performance outcomes.\nAt the start of each year, the Board sets performance objectives for the CEO and each of our Disclosed Executives that are intended to be stretching yet achievable. These contain a blend of both financial (weighted no more than 45%) and non-financial measures designed to focus executives on delivering sustainable long-term performance that supports both good customer and shareholder outcomes aligned to our long-term strategic objectives.\nThe CEO’s performance is assessed against a number of factors including the Group Performance Framework and individual strategic objectives. Although the Board assessed his performance as slightly below expectations, the Board exercised their discretion and applied a reduction to the CEO’s 2019 AVR outcome. This resulted in an award of 48% of maximum opportunity in recognition of the fact that as CEO he is ultimately accountable for overall performance.\nThis year’s VR outcomes for Disclosed Executives ranged from 0% to 74% (2018: 40% to 60%) and averaged 45% (2018: 51%) of maximum opportunity demonstrating the ‘at risk’ nature of variable remuneration. There is significant differentiation in outcomes – with two Disclosed Executives receiving less than 45% of maximum opportunity and one receiving no VR.\nInclude more rationale to help investors understand why the Board believes the remuneration outcomes are appropriate.\nThe variable remuneration structure and outcomes for the CEO and Disclosed Executives are the subject of considerable debate and evaluation by both the HR Committee and the Board. These decisions are not taken lightly or quickly.\nIn response to this feedback, the 2019 Remuneration Report aims to provide further clarity to help shareholders better understand both the process (how performance and remuneration outcomes are determined) and the rationale (why the Board believe this year’s outcomes are appropriate for the CEO and Disclosed Executives). Better explain how consequences are applied for executives for poor conduct/issues ‘on their watch’ that damaged customers and shareholders.\nIn 2019 we implemented a strengthened Accountability and Consequence Framework so that meaningful consequences are applied to executives and employees at all levels, where it is appropriate, for material risk events.\nThe Consequence Review Group (CRG), which is now chaired by the CEO, meets at least four times a year. The CRG reviews material risk events, and considers recommendations from each business regarding accountability and the application of consequences for significant Code of Conduct breaches and material risk and audit events. We have also expanded our disclosures in this report to provide more information on the number of employees where formal consequences have been applied in the 2019 financial year. See section 7.\nThe departure of the Group Executive and CEO, NZ was a clear and public example of the application of meaningful consequences this year. His employment ceased, he was paid no variable remuneration and all unvested deferred remuneration (~$7.4 million) was immediately forfeited. Use ‘face value’ rather than ‘fair value’ when determining the number of deferred share rights awarded to the CRO.\nWe have changed our approach and will award the CRO deferred share rights using the face value of the Company’s shares (rather than the fair value – which is the face value adjusted for the loss of dividends). In order to maintain the same opportunity value, the VR maximum opportunity percentage has been adjusted to 270% of fixed remuneration (previously 255%). This change maintains – it does not increase – the dollar value maximum opportunity, therefore the CRO would not receive greater VR for the same level of performance. Focus on maximum variable remuneration opportunity rather than target opportunity.\nVariable remuneration outcomes are now primarily expressed as a percentage of maximum opportunity, and the value of performance rights shown using the face value of the rights at full (100%) vesting. This approach more clearly demonstrates the executives’ actual outcomes in comparison to the value they could be awarded if expectations were exceeded at the highest level. There is no change in practice or opportunity.\n68\n2. WHO IS COVERED BY THIS REPORT\n2.1 DISCLOSED EXECUTIVE AND NED CHANGES\nThere were several changes to our Key Management Personnel (KMP) during the 2019 year:\nLee Hsien Yang (former NED) retired at the 2018 AGM in December 2018.\nLee Hsien Yang (former NED) retired at the 2018 AGM in December 2018.\nFred Ohlsson stepped down as Group Executive, Australia in December 2018 to take an extended unpaid career-break, and Mark Hand subsequently acted in the role whilst the Australia Division structure was reviewed.\nFollowing a structure review, effective March 2019 Mark Hand and Maile Carnegie share responsibility for the financial performance of our business in Australia. Mark was appointed to the Group Executive, Australia Retail and Commercial Banking role and Maile’s role expanded to Group Executive, Digital and Australia Transformation.\nDavid Hisco (former Group Executive and CEO, NZ) departed ANZ in June 2019. Antonia Watson has been subsequently acting in the role.\n2.2 KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL (KMP)\nThe KMP whose remuneration is disclosed in this year’s report are:\nNon-Executive Directors (NEDs) – Current\nD Gonski\nChairman\nI Atlas\nDirector\nP Dwyer\nDirector\nJ Halton\nDirector\nJ Key\nDirector\nG Liebelt\nDirector\nJ Macfarlane\nDirector\nNon-Executive Directors (NEDs) – Former\nH Lee\nFormer Director – retired 19 December 2018\nChief Executive Officer (CEO) and Disclosed Executives – Current\nS Elliott\nChief Executive Officer and Executive Director\nGroup Executive, Digital and Australia Transformation – appointed 1 March 2019 (formerly Group Executive, Digital Banking)\nK Corbally\nChief Risk Officer (CRO)\nA George\nDeputy Chief Executive Officer and Group Executive, Wealth Australia\nM Hand\nGroup Executive, Australia Retail and Commercial Banking – appointed 1 March 2019 (Acting Group Executive, Australia from 29 December 2018 to 28 February 2019)\nM Jablko\nChief Financial Officer (CFO)\nA Watson\nActing Group Executive and Chief Executive Officer, New Zealand – appointed 17 June 2019\nM Whelan\nGroup Executive, Institutional\nDisclosed Executives – Former\nD Hisco\nFormer Group Executive and Chief Executive Officer, New Zealand – concluded in role and ceased employment 14 June 2019\nF Ohlsson\nFormer Group Executive, Australia – concluded in role 28 December 2018\nThe Remuneration Report for the Group outlines our remuneration strategy and framework and the remuneration practices that apply to KMP.

This reflects performance against his individual objectives and the Group Performance Framework, and the exercise of Board discretion considering his accountability as CEO for the overall performance of the Group.\nDisclosed Executives – Mark Hand on appointment to the Group Executive, Australia Retail and Commercial Banking role to reflect his expanded responsibilities, and Kevin Corbally (CRO) based on a review of internal and external market relativities, and in recognition of the increase in regulatory activity and complexity of the risk environment.\nSubject to shareholder approval at the 2019 AGM, he will be awarded Long Term Variable Remuneration (LTVR) of $4.2 million (200% of fixed remuneration) which may vest in 2023 subject to meeting performance hurdles.\nVariable Remuneration (VR) outcomes for our Disclosed Executives averaged 45% of maximum opportunity, with substantial differentiation at an individual level ranging from 0% to 74% (40% to 60% in 2018).\nReceived total remuneration of $4.09 million for 2019.\nUpon cessation of employment David Hisco (former Group Executive and CEO, NZ) forfeited all his unvested equity (~$7.4 million). He received his contracted and statutory entitlements to notice and untaken leave, and was not awarded any VR.\nPerformance rights outcomes (CEO and Disclosed Executives)\nThe performance rights awarded to the CEO and Disclosed Executives in November/December 2015 were tested in November 2018 against their three equal Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance hurdles. A total of 21.8% of the award vested and the remaining 78.2% lapsed. See section 5.4.3 for further details.\nNon-Executive Director (NED) fees\nThere were no increases to NED fees in 2019 (or 2018). Rather, the Board decided to apply a 20% reduction to the Chairman and NED member fees for 2019.\n4. OVERVIEW OF ANZ’S REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK\n4.1 CHANGES TO THE CEO AND DISCLOSED EXECUTIVES’ REMUNERATION FRAMEWORKS MADE IN 2019\nThe following changes were made to the CEO and Disclosed Executives’ remuneration frameworks for 2019:\nFour-year deferral: The deferral and performance period for the performance rights (excluding the CRO who receives deferred share rights) has been extended from three years to four years. This provides an additional year for the performance rights to remain at risk (subject to malus) and for the performance hurdles to be measured.\nVesting period: The deferred shares will be delivered over four years with staggered vesting (previously even vesting). See section 6.2.\nFor the CRO: The number of deferred share rights awarded will be determined using the face value (previously fair value), and these share rights will now be subject to a four-year deferral period (previously three years).\nThe differing remuneration structure for the CRO is designed to preserve the independence of the role and to minimise any conflicts of\ninterest in carrying out the risk control function across ANZ.\nAs a result of these changes, 68% of variable remuneration (AVR plus LTVR) for the CEO, 53% of VR for Disclosed Executives (other than the CRO), and 41% of VR for the CRO will be deferred for at least four years, noting that this is in excess of the BEAR minimum deferral requirement of 60% for the CEO and 40% for Disclosed Executives. See section 6.2 for more detail.\n70\n4.2 REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW\nThe structure of our remuneration framework is aligned with our Reward Principles and has been designed to support ANZ’s purpose and strategy.\nANZ’S PURPOSE AND STRATEGY1\nIs underpinned by our Remuneration Policy which includes our Reward Principles:\nAttract, motivate and keep great people\nReward our people for doing the right thing having regard to our customers and shareholders\nFocus on how things are achieved as much as what is achieved\nAre fair and simple to understand\nWith remuneration delivered to our CEO and Disclosed Executives through:\nFixed remuneration Cash salary and superannuation contributions.

Performance rights face value at full vesting.\n71\n5. 2019 OUTCOMES\nWe are mindful of the fact that variable remuneration (more broadly than it pertains to ANZ) has been the subject of much scrutiny with questions raised regarding whether it is truly at risk and sufficiently variable. Variable remuneration at ANZ is truly at risk and can range from zero to maximum opportunity, as evidenced by the outcomes in 2019.\nThe variable remuneration outcomes for both the CEO and Disclosed Executives are the subject of considerable debate and evaluation by the HR Committee and the Board. These decisions are not taken lightly or quickly.\nThe tables in sections 5.1 and 5.2 supplement, and are different to, the Statutory Remuneration table (see section 10.1) which presents the accounting expense for both vested and unvested awards in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards.\n5.1 YEAR-ON-YEAR REMUNERATION AWARDED\nThese tables show a year-on-year comparison of remuneration awarded to the CEO and Disclosed Executives for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 performance periods. Remuneration awarded includes any cash payments (e.g. fixed remuneration and cash variable remuneration) and the value of deferred shares and performance rights awarded for the year but which have not yet vested (i.e. the value which has not yet been received during the year). These tables also show the AVR/VR as a % of target and maximum opportunity – this % remains unchanged whether using the threshold or full vesting value of performance rights.\nFixed remuneration is largely unchanged year-on-year other than where executives have changed roles. Variable remuneration differs significantly both year-on-year and between different executives, and appropriately reflects the variability in Group and individual performance year-on-year.

The only changes made were for two executives.\nBoard discretion\n= As CEO Shayne Elliott is ultimately accountable for the Group’s overall performance, the Board has exercised their discretion in determining the appropriate AVR outcome for 2019 as detailed below.\nKevin Corbally received a fixed remuneration increase from $900,000 to $1,000,000 on 1 April 2019. On commencing in his role as CRO, Kevin’s fixed remuneration was set below the market median for comparable roles in peer group companies and lower than that of his predecessor. With the significant increase in regulatory activity and complexity of the risk environment, and following a strong performance in his role and reviewing internal relativities, the Board considered the increase appropriate.\n2019 CEO individual strategic objectives\nLead and role model the culture and accountability required to transform ANZ to deliver better customer outcomes and long-term shareholder value\nEnhance the reputation of ANZ\nMark Hand received a fixed remuneration increase from $800,000 to $1,000,000 on his appointment to the Group Executive, Australia Retail and Commercial Banking role effective 1 March 2019 to reflect his expanded responsibilities.\nDrive the strategic direction of the organisation to deliver long-term, sustainable and profitable growth\nDrive the success of New Ways of Working (NWOW) at ANZ and demonstrate better customer outcomes and productivity gains\n5.4 VARIABLE REMUNERATION – DETAIL\nContinue to build Group Executive Committee effectiveness and CEO succession\n5.4.1 CEO performance, AVR and LTVR\nPerformance\nWith regard to AVR, the CEO is assessed 50% on the ANZ Group Performance Framework and 50% on achievement of individual strategic objectives aligned to ANZ’s strategy. Both the Group Performance Framework and individual strategic objectives are agreed by the Board at the start of the financial year and intended to be stretching.\nBoard assessment of performance on individual strategic objectives: Slightly Below Expectations\nThe CEO consistently role modelled the ANZ culture and values in his actions throughout a challenging year for the banking sector. This included the content and manner of his testimony before the Royal Commission and also his handling of the Code of Conduct breach by the former Group Executive and CEO, NZ.\nWeighting of financial metrics\nAVR: Financial metrics have a 35% weighting in the Group Performance Framework and therefore notionally have a 17.5% weighting in the CEO’s AVR. However, the CEO’s AVR is not formulaic – outcomes are moderated by the Risk and Reputation element of the Group Performance Framework and the Board’s judgement on the appropriate AVR considering all aspects of performance.\nLTVR: 100% of the LTVR hurdles are based on TSR (both relative and absolute). ANZ’s view is that TSR is not purely a financial measure as it reflects a range of factors including investors’ judgement about the prospects of a company.\nWork continued on rebuilding ANZ’s reputation following the Royal Commission last year. However, this was impacted by further remediation charges and challenges in our NZ business. In Australia Retail and Commercial, poor execution of changes to certain processes and procedures including technology transition saw customer loan assessment and approval times extend, leading to a loss of market share. Actions taken throughout mid calendar 2019 have improved these issues.\nThe CEO has continued to build on the key planks of the ANZ strategy – capital efficiency, productivity and simplification – to deliver long-term targeted growth. ANZ delivered a solid financial performance in 2019 – with capital well above APRA’s unquestionably strong Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) requirements, continued productivity savings and the completion of further asset/business disposals. While lending growth in the year was modest, delivery of the core aspects of the strategy positions ANZ well for the future.\nAt the end of the financial year, ANZ’s performance is assessed against the Group Performance Framework, and the CEO’s performance is assessed against his individual strategic objectives, the ANZ values (behaviours), delivery of the BEAR obligations and ANZ’s risk and compliance standards. In conducting the CEO’s performance assessment, the HR Committee seeks input from the Chairman, CRO (on risk management), CFO (on financial performance), Group Executive, Talent and Culture (GE T&C) (on talent and culture matters) and Group General Manager Internal Audit (GGM IA) (on internal audit matters).\nAround 25% of our people now work in new ways which is driving speed and productivity benefits. These changes are enhancing speed of delivery to customers and producing higher employee engagement results.\nThe CEO has restructured accountability of the Group Executive Committee in 2019 to enhance success and strengthen succession – filling the gaps arising in the Australian business leadership and in dealing with the NZ business leadership issues including the cessation of the former Group Executive and CEO, NZ.\n74\nAVR and LTVR\nAt the end of the financial year, the HR Committee determines the CEO’s AVR outcome which is ultimately approved by the Board.\nThe CEO’s AVR will vary up or down year-on-year, it is not guaranteed, and may range from zero to a maximum opportunity.\nslightly below on individual strategic objectives and the Group Performance Framework, the Board has exercised its discretion and reduced the AVR having regard to the CEO’s ultimate accountability for the overall performance of the Group. The Board determined that an AVR outcome of 48% of maximum opportunity was appropriate for 2019.\nThe 2019 AVR awarded to the CEO is 48% of maximum opportunity. Shayne Elliott has demonstrated strong leadership both within ANZ and the industry more broadly and delivered solid results for the Group. He has dealt with challenges which arose during the year in a way that is consistent with the culture we are seeking.\nThe CEO’s proposed LTVR of $4.2 million (performance rights face value at full vesting) is subject to shareholder approval at the 2019 AGM.\n2019 AVR Awarded\nDespite having been assessed as met or being above expectations on the risk/compliance assessment and ANZ values, and being\nThis table shows the AVR awarded to the CEO for the year ending 30 September 2019.\nCEO\nMaximum opportunity\nS Elliott1 AVR $1,500,000 48% of max\n=\n$750,000\n+\n$750,000\n+\nLTVR $4,200,000 performance rights face value at full vesting (subject to shareholder approval at the 2019 AGM)\nCash\nDeferred shares\n1. Variable remuneration for the CEO = AVR + LTVR.\nSummary of Total Remuneration\nThe remuneration Shayne Elliott received in 2019 differs to the remuneration he was awarded in relation to the 2019 performance year (which may or may not vest in future years), and also how his remuneration was expensed (on a statutory basis) for 2019. Awarded remuneration shown below includes the value of the performance rights at both threshold (50%) and full (100%) vesting.\nTotal Remuneration\nAwarded\nReceived1\nStatutory2\nThreshold vesting\nFull vesting\n2019\n$5,700,000\n$7,800,000\n$4,093,464\n$5,181,339\n2018\n$5,250,000\n$6,650,000\n$3,849,666\n$5,645,295\n2017\n$6,200,000\n$8,300,000\n$4,261,588\n$5,634,860\n1.\n2.\nIncludes the value of previously awarded AVR deferred shares and LTVR performance rights at the date of vesting.

The weighting of measures varies to reflect the responsibilities of each individual’s role. The Financial and Discipline element weightings range from 20% to 45%.\n75\nAt the end of the financial year, the performance of each Disclosed Executive is assessed against their contribution to the Group Performance Framework, their Divisional Performance Framework, ANZ’s values (behaviours), delivery of BEAR obligations and ANZ’s risk and compliance standards.\nThe HR Committee seeks input from the CEO, CRO (on risk management), CFO (on financial performance), GE T&C (on talent and culture matters) and GGM IA (on internal audit matters).\nMark Whelan has been awarded 74% of maximum\nopportunity reflecting the delivery of strong financial results across Institutional, sound risk management, the continued transformation of this business, and the strong focus on culture.\nAlexis George has a broad role: she is Deputy CEO and also has responsibility for Operations and Services and Wealth Australia. Her VR outcome of 53% of maximum opportunity was impacted for Wealth remediation while also taking into account her strong performance across all aspects of her role.\nThe HR Committee reviews and recommends to the Board for approval the overall performance outcomes for each Disclosed Executive.\nVR\nAt the end of the financial year, the CEO and HR Committee also determine VR recommendations for each Disclosed Executive, which are ultimately approved by the Board. VR should and does vary year- on-year in line with performance – it is not guaranteed and may be adjusted up or down ranging from zero to a maximum opportunity.\nThe average 2019 VR for Disclosed Executives is 45% of maximum opportunity. There is significant differentiation at an individual level ranging between 0% to 74% of maximum. The different VR outcomes reflect the relative performance of the different areas/ individuals, ensuring appropriate alignment between performance and reward. The outcomes also demonstrate the at risk nature of VR, showing that VR is truly variable, and that outcomes do vary significantly across the Disclosed Executives and also from year to year. To illustrate we note that:\nMark Hand moved into leading Australia Retail and Commercial part way through the year. He is the right person to run this part of the business going forward and has already led a strong program of work to restore business momentum. However as Group Executive he is held accountable for the weaker performance of this business and has been awarded VR at 28% of maximum opportunity.\nDavid Hisco was in his role for eight and a half months of the year, however given the circumstances of his departure, was not awarded any VR (and he also immediately forfeited all unvested remuneration).\nFred Ohlsson was not eligible for 2019 VR due to being in his role for approximately three months in 2019.\n2019 VR Awarded\nThis table shows the combined VR awarded to Disclosed Executives for the year ending 30 September 2019.

From 2016 ANZ moved from three to two TSR hurdles (the relative TSR – ASX 50 hurdle was discontinued).\n5.5 ANZIP VARIABLE REMUNERATION POOL AND GROUP PERFORMANCE\n5.5.1 ANZIP variable remuneration pool\nThe ANZ Incentive Plan (ANZIP) is the variable remuneration plan that covers the CEO and Disclosed Executives (and the majority of employees). Individual variable remuneration outcomes are funded from the ANZIP pool for all eligible employees, including the CEO’s AVR and Disclosed Executives’ VR.\nAt the end of each financial year, the HR Committee makes a recommendation to the Board for their approval on the size of the ANZIP variable remuneration pool for that year, including its allocation to each Division. The Board exercise their judgement to determine the appropriate pool size – it is not a formulaic outcome.\nANZIP variable remuneration pool recommended to the Board for approval based on performance and affordability\nBoard review and approve the ANZIP variable remuneration pool\nBusiness and individual allocations from ANZIP variable remuneration pool\nWhen determining the size of the 2019 variable remuneration pool the HR Committee and Board considered a range of inputs. These included:\nour financial performance – a range of metrics are used including cash profit, economic profit and return on risk weighted assets. Economic profit, which is a risk adjusted measure and a strong indicator of shareholder value, is the primary financial driver but is balanced against other financial metrics and qualitative factors. – Solid financial performance with cash profit up 6%, while on a continuing operations basis cash profit is flat and economic profit down 1%.\nour performance against the ANZ Group Performance Framework.\n– Assessed overall as being below expectations in 2019 (as detailed in section 5.5.3).\nother relevant factors such as the overall operating environment, market competitive remuneration positioning, affordability, the quality of our results and prior year pools.\nANZ substantially reduced the size of the ANZIP pool in 2018 decreasing it by around 23% compared to the prior financial year.\nIn 2019, having considered all of the above inputs, the Board determined that a year-on-year increase of around 9% was appropriate, and recognising that the pool remains 15% below that of 2017.\n77\n5.5.2 ANZ Group Performance Framework\nThe ANZ Group Performance Framework is approved by the Board at the start of each year and is designed around the following three key inputs:\n1\nCreating a safe bank with sound risk practices\n2\nAchieving our agreed annual and longer term goals\n3\nRealising our strategic vision\nThe key objective of our Group Performance Framework is to enable aligned focus across the organisation on delivering the critical outcomes that matter most in successful realisation of our strategy, which includes strong and sustainable performance within the year. It plays a key role to:\nmessage internally what matters most;\nreinforce the importance of sound management in addition to risk, customer, people and financial outcomes; and\ninform focus of effort, prioritisation and decision outcomes across ANZ.\n5.5.3 Assessment against the Group Performance Framework for 2019\nRisk & Reputation\nCustomer\nPeople & Culture\nFinancial & Discipline\nOverall\nOverall Adjustment\n35% weight\n30% weight\n35% weight\nGroup Performance\nx\n+\n+\n=\nASSESSMENT:\nASSESSMENT:\nASSESSMENT:\nASSESSMENT:\nASSESSMENT:\nBelow Expectations\nBelow Expectations\nAbove Expectations\nMet Expectations\nBelow Expectations\nAs managing risk appropriately is fundamental to the way ANZ operates, Risk and Reputation forms an integral part of the assessment, directly impacting the overall Group Performance Framework outcome (a modifier ranging from 0% to 110% of the Group Performance Assessment).\nOverall, ANZ’s performance was below expectations when considering the environment and the objectives we set ourselves. While we largely achieved the targets we set, more broadly we recognise we have much to do to regain community trust.\nThe below table outlines ANZ’s focus areas in 2019 (aligned to the three key inputs), and provides a summary of performance outcomes for each of the key performance categories to inform the overall assessment for 2019. Performance against expectations is evaluated using a range of objective indicators and subjective considerations including management input on work undertaken, evidence of outcomes realised and lessons learned, and with consideration given to the operating, regulatory and competitive environment.\n78\nRISK & REPUTATION (MODIFIER 0% TO 110%) Risk & Reputation (modifier 0% to 110%)\nANZ continues to operate in a dynamic and a challenging external and regulatory environment placing significant demands on the Risk and Compliance function. There were no material breaches of our Group Risk Appetite Statement, and the number of adverse audits fell by a third with management demonstrating accountability for fixing issues in a timely and sustainable manner. Strong leadership has been paramount, coupled with a focus on seeking to regain the trust of the community through our commitment to fair and responsible banking. A combination of management actions over several years together with the current relatively benign credit environment, delivered one of the lowest loss rates on record. While there were many positives from a risk perspective, our overall risk assessment was brought back to below expectations when balanced against some non-financial risk shortcomings from a regulatory, customer and community perspective and the work that still needs to be done to regain community trust.\n2019 focus areas\nPerformance commentary\nPerformance against Expectations\nBelow\nMet\nAbove\nAdhere to the Risk Appetite Statement\nMetrics within agreed tolerances (e.g. no material breaches).\nDisciplined risk management over several years (including reshaping the loan portfolio often at the expense of revenue), saw the 2019 loss rate at 13 bps.\nAdopt a sound approach to regulatory matters\nANZ continued to work to support our regulators desired outcomes in their activities and addressing their requirements, however there were some shortcomings in 2019: – Two material regulatory infractions in NZ in relation to capital models\nANZ continued to work to support our regulators desired outcomes in their activities and addressing their requirements, however there were some shortcomings in 2019: – Two material regulatory infractions in NZ in relation to capital models\nand attestation process.\n– Along with domestic peers an additional capital overlay required for operational risk following APRA’s self-assessment into governance, culture and accountability.\nEnsure our leaders demonstrate accountability for managing risk, including creating an environment where people can raise issues\nStrong progress made on risk culture maturity, evidenced in employee engagement scores, with ‘Leaders accountable for risk’ (83%) – improvement on 2018 and above 2019 target, and ‘Raise issues without fear of reprisal’ (69%) – also up on 2018.\nWhile remediation focused on strategic and long-term fixes (systems, terms and conditions and product decommissioning), short-term fixes included refunding greater than 1 million accounts.

There were however some challenges during the year which led to a below expectations assessment. These included some technology stability issues, and a period of underperformance in respect of assessment and approval times relative to peers in home lending. Institutional performance in key customer satisfaction/relationship strength surveys continued to be a highlight, along with strong digital engagement with customers.\n2019 focus areas\nPerformance commentary\nPerformance against Expectations\nBelow\nMet\nAbove\nImprove customer experience (key impact to customer assessment outcome)\nExamples of initiatives to improve the customer experience include: in Australia introducing Customer Promises to improve service, and organising our people around customer episodes; in NZ launching the Healthy Homes initiative and helping customers with persistent card debt.\nA period of below peer approval and assessment times in Australian home lending (an outcome of a higher level of change, including enhanced assessment criteria and delays in moving to a single assessment platform).\nListen, Learn, Act to drive continuous improvement\nNet Promoter Score (NPS)4 centred on key onboarding episodes.

ANZ was well prepared for these difficult conditions, maintaining a strong balance sheet, peer leading levels of capital, demonstrating good cost management despite higher regulatory and compliance spend, and further improvements in our credit risk profile. At no time did the bank deviate from its strategy or risk appetite to seek higher revenues. Divestments during the year again reduced the complexity of the Group. Ongoing work to identify customers in need of remediation led to further remediation charges, which impacted financial performance.\n2019 focus areas\nPerformance commentary\nPerformance against Expectations\nBelow\nMet\nAbove\nBalance appropriately between financial results, safety and soundness, and investment in the future\nReturn on equity (ROE) (cash continuing) of 10.9% was on target, noting the difficult operating environment.\nOperating expenses were down 4%.

The Group uses cash profit as a measure of performance for the Group’s ongoing business activities, as this provides a basis to assess Group and Divisional performance against earlier periods and against peer institutions. We calculate cash profit by adjusting statutory profit for non-core items. Although cash profit is not audited, the external auditor has informed the Audit Committee that recurring adjustments have been determined on a consistent basis across each period presented.\nThe table below provides ANZ’s financial performance, including cash profit, over the last five years.\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\nStatutory profit ($m)\n7,493\n5,709\n6,406\n6,400\n5,953\nCash profit ($m, unaudited)\n7,216\n5,889\n6,938\n5,805\n6,161\nCash profit – Continuing operations ($m, unaudited)1\n7,216\n5,889\n6,809\n6,487\n6,470\nCash ROE (%) – Continuing operations (unaudited)1\n14.0\n10.3\n11.7\n11.0\n10.9\nCash EPS – Continuing operations (unaudited)1\n260.3\n202.6\n232.7\n223.4\n227.6\nShare price at 30 September ($) (On 1 October 2014, opening share price was $30.74)\n27.08\n27.63\n29.60\n28.18\n28.52\nTotal dividend (cents per share)\n181\n160\n160\n160\n160\nTotal shareholder return (12 month %)\n(7.5)\n9.2\n13.1\n0.6\n9.2\n1. Cash profit from continuing operations has been presented for 2017, 2018 and 2019. Prior periods are not restated. Cash profit from continuing operations represents the Group’s cash profit excluding the impact of our discontinued businesses, which consist of OnePath Pensions and Investments and aligned dealer groups, and the Group’s life insurance business in Australia. The businesses were reclassified to discontinuing in 2018, and only the 2017 result was restated in the table above. During 2019, the Group adopted AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and only 2018 has been restated.\nANZ TSR performance (1 to 10 years)\nThe table below compares ANZ’s TSR performance against the median TSR and upper quartile TSR of the performance rights Select Financial Services (SFS) comparator group over one to ten years.

The outcomes for performance rights granted in November/December 2015 and tested in November 2018 are detailed in section 5.4.3.\n6. EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION STRUCTURE AND DELIVERY\nThere are two core components of remuneration at ANZ – fixed remuneration and at risk variable remuneration.\n– tie the full VR award to the performance of ANZ; and – defer VR over the short, medium and longer term.\nIn structuring remuneration, the Board aims to find the right balance between fixed and variable remuneration (at risk), the way it is delivered (cash versus deferred remuneration) and appropriate time frames (the short, medium and long-term).\nVariable remuneration seeks to differentiate for performance and is designed to focus our CEO and Disclosed Executives on stretching performance objectives supporting our business strategy, and encourage the delivery of long-term stakeholder value.\nThe way variable remuneration operates differs somewhat between the CEO and Disclosed Executives. Namely:\nThe CEO’s variable remuneration is comprised of AVR and LTVR (subject to shareholder approval), which provides consistency with external market practice, and LTVR reinforces his focus on achieving longer term strategic objectives and long-term stakeholder value creation.\nDisclosed Executives are subject to one combined VR plan which enables us to: – provide the appropriate mix of short and long-term rewards (including performance hurdles) to drive performance, and attract and retain talent;\nBy deferring a significant portion of variable remuneration (79% of maximum opportunity for the CEO, 75% for Disclosed Executives, 67% for the CRO and 40% for the Acting Group Executive and CEO, NZ), we seek to ensure alignment with shareholder interests to deliver on ANZ’s strategic objectives and ensure a focus on long-term value creation. Deferred variable remuneration has significant retention elements, and most importantly, can be adjusted downwards, including to zero, allowing the Board to hold executives accountable, individually or collectively, for the longer term impacts of their decisions and actions.\nBoard discretion is applied when determining all CEO and Disclosed Executive variable remuneration outcomes, and also before any scheduled release of previously deferred remuneration (i.e. consider malus or further deferral).\n83\n17%\n17%\n22%\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nRemuneration Report continued\n20%\n6.1 REMUNERATION MIX\nWe structure the CEO and Disclosed Executives’ remuneration as follows:\nCEO\nMinimum opportunity\n$2.1 million\n100%\nTarget opportunity\n17%\n33%\n$6.3 million\n33%\nMaximum opportunity\n22%\n17%\n44%\n$9.45 million\nAVR cash\nFixed remuneration\nLTVR performance rights\nAVR deferred shares\nMinimum = Fixed remuneration ($2.1 million) Target\n= Fixed remuneration + target AVR (100% of fixed remuneration) + target LTVR (100% of fixed remuneration\n(performance rights face value at threshold vesting))\nMaximum = Fixed remuneration + maximum AVR (150% of fixed remuneration) + maximum LTVR\n(200% of fixed remuneration (performance rights face value to full vesting))\nDisclosed Executive1\nMinimum opportunity\n100%\nTarget opportunity\n22%\n33%\n23%\nMaximum opportunity\n20%\n20%\n40%\nVR cash\nFixed remuneration\nVR performance rights\nVR deferred shares\nMinimum = Fixed remuneration Target Maximum = Fixed remuneration + maximum VR (402% of fixed remuneration (150% of target VR and performance rights face value to full vesting))\n= Fixed remuneration + target VR (200% of fixed remuneration (performance rights face value at threshold vesting))\n1. Excluding CRO and Acting Group Executive and CEO, NZ.\nCRO\nActing Group Executive and CEO, NZ\nTo preserve the independence of the role and to minimise any conflicts of interest in carrying out the risk control function across the organisation, the CRO’s remuneration arrangements differ to other Disclosed Executives.\nDue to the acting nature of Antonia Watson’s appointment her remuneration arrangements differ to other Disclosed Executives. For the time spent in this acting role, her fixed remuneration has been set at NZ$800,000 per annum (from 17 June 2019) and her VR maximum opportunity has been increased to 300% of fixed remuneration (her remuneration mix is therefore 25% fixed remuneration and 75% VR maximum opportunity). Her VR will be delivered as 60% cash and 40% as shares deferred for four years (ensuring compliance with the BEAR).\nThe remuneration mix is 27% fixed remuneration and 73% VR maximum opportunity. The VR target opportunity is 180% of fixed remuneration and VR maximum opportunity is 270% of fixed remuneration. VR is delivered as 33% cash, 33% deferred shares and 34% deferred share rights (instead of performance rights).\n84\n6.2. VARIABLE REMUNERATION DELIVERY\nVariable remuneration for the CEO and the Disclosed Executives (excluding the CRO and Acting Group Executive and CEO, NZ) is delivered partly in cash, shares deferred over four years, and performance rights deferred over four years. The performance rights are also subject to performance hurdles which determine whether they vest in four years’ time.\nBefore any scheduled release of deferred shares/deferred share rights/performance rights, the Board considers whether any malus/downward adjustment of previously deferred remuneration (or further deferral of vesting) should be made for the CEO and Disclosed Executives.

Deferred shares for the Acting Group Executive and CEO, NZ vest as follows: 100% at the end of year 4.\n2. Deferred share rights for the CRO. No performance rights for the Acting Group Executive and CEO, NZ.\n6.2.1 Cash – CEO (AVR) and Disclosed Executives (VR)\nThe cash component is paid to executives at the end of the annual Performance and Remuneration Review (usually in late November).\n6.2.2 Deferred shares – CEO (AVR) and Disclosed Executives (VR)\nDeferred shares are ordinary shares, deferred over one to four years (deferred for four years for the Acting Group Executive and CEO, NZ). By deferring part of an executives’ remuneration over time (and it remaining subject to malus), we enable a substantial amount of their remuneration to be directly linked to delivering long-term shareholder value. We grant deferred shares in respect of performance for the 1 October to 30 September financial year in late November each year.\nWe calculate the number of deferred shares to be granted based on the VWAP of the shares traded on the ASX in the week leading up to and including the date of grant. For disclosure and expensing purposes, we use the one day VWAP to determine the fair value.\nIn some cases (generally due to regulatory or tax reasons), we may grant deferred share rights to executives instead of deferred shares. Each deferred share right entitles the holder to one ordinary share.\n6.2.3a Performance rights – CEO (LTVR) and Disclosed Executives (VR) excluding the CRO and Acting Group Executive and CEO, NZ\nA performance right is a right to acquire one ordinary ANZ share at nil cost – as long as time and performance hurdles are met. The future value of performance rights may range from zero to an indeterminate value. The value depends on our performance against the hurdles and on the share price at the time of exercise.\n3 2 0 2 v o N\n85\nThe performance rights have a four-year performance period. For the 2019 grant, the performance period is from 22 November 2019 to 21 November 2023. A four-year performance period provides sufficient time for longer term performance to be reflected.\nMore detail relating to the 2019 performance rights is provided below.\nElement\nDetail\nPerformance rights hurdles\nThe performance rights have TSR performance hurdles reflecting the importance of focusing on achieving longer term strategic objectives and aligning executives’ and shareholders’ interests. We will apply two TSR performance hurdles for the 2019 grants of performance rights:\n75% will be measured against a relative TSR hurdle, tranche 1.\n25% will be measured against an absolute TSR hurdle, tranche 2.\nTSR represents the change in value of a share plus the value of reinvested dividends paid. We regard it as the most appropriate long-term measure – it focuses on the delivery of shareholder value and is a well understood and tested mechanism to measure performance.\nThe combination of relative and absolute TSR hurdles provides balance to the plan by:\nRelative: rewarding executives for performance that exceeds that of comparator companies; and\nAbsolute: ensuring there is a continued focus on providing positive growth – even when the market is declining.\nThe two hurdles measure separate aspects of performance:\nthe relative TSR hurdle measures our TSR compared to that of the Select Financial Services comparator group, made up of core local and global competitors. This comparator group is chosen to broadly reflect the geographies and business segments in which ANZ competes for revenue; and\nthe absolute Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) TSR hurdle provides executives with a more direct line of sight to the level of shareholder return to be achieved. It also provides a tighter correlation between the executives’ rewards and the shareholders’ financial outcomes.\nWe will measure ANZ’s TSR against each hurdle at the end of the four-year performance period to determine whether each tranche of performance rights become exercisable. We measure each tranche independently from the other – that is: one tranche may vest fully or partially but the other tranche may not vest.\nRelative TSR hurdle for the 2019 grant\nThe relative TSR hurdle is an external hurdle that measures our TSR against that of the Select Financial Services comparator group over four years. The Select Financial Services comparator group (unchanged from prior years) is made up of: Bank of Queensland Limited; Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited; Commonwealth Bank of Australia Limited; DBS Bank Limited; Macquarie Group Limited; National Australia Bank Limited; Standard Chartered PLC; Suncorp Group Limited; and Westpac Banking Corporation.\nIf our TSR when compared to the TSR of the comparator group is less than the 50th percentile reaches at least the 50th percentile, but is less than the 75th percentile\nthen the percentage of performance rights that vest\nis nil is 50% plus 2% for every one percentile increase above the 50th percentile\nreaches or exceeds the 75th percentile\nis 100%\nAbsolute TSR hurdle for the 2019 grant\nThe Absolute CAGR TSR hurdle is an internal hurdle as to whether ANZ achieves or exceeds a threshold level of growth the Board sets at the start of the performance period.\nThe Board reviews and approves the absolute TSR targets each year for that year’s award. When reviewing the targets, the Board references ANZ’s assessed Cost of Capital. The Cost of Capital is determined using methodologies including the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The primary driver of the reduction in the Cost of Capital used in setting this year’s target is the reduction in the risk free rate (government bond yield) that has occurred in Australia and other developed economies in the last 12 months.\nIf the absolute CAGR of our TSR\nthen the percentage of performance rights that vest\nis less than 8.5%\nis nil\nis 8.5%\nis 50%\nreaches at least 8.5%, but is less than 12.75%\nis progressively increased on a pro-rata, straight-line, basis from 50% to 100%\nreaches or exceeds 12.75%\nis 100%\n86\nCalculating TSR performance\nWhen calculating performance against TSR, we: • reduce the impact of share price volatility – by using an averaging calculation over a 90-day period for start\nand end values;\nensure an independent measurement – by engaging the services of an external organisation, Mercer Consulting (Australia) Pty Ltd, to calculate ANZ’s performance against the TSR hurdles; and\ntest the performance against the relevant hurdle once only at the end of the four-year performance period – the rights lapse if the performance hurdle is not met – there is no retesting.\nCalculating the number of performance rights\nThe number of performance rights we grant is calculated using a face value basis – i.e. the full share price. Face value at full vesting is split into two tranches. Each tranche value is then divided by the market price (five trading day VWAP of ANZ shares at the start of the performance period) to determine the number of performance rights we award in each tranche.\nPerformance rights are allocated in November for Disclosed Executives and December for the CEO (subject to shareholder approval).\nExpensing performance rights\nANZ engages PricewaterhouseCoopers to independently determine the fair value of performance rights, which is only used for expensing purposes. They consider factors including: the performance conditions, share price volatility, life of the instrument, dividend yield, and share price at grant date.\n6.2.3b Deferred share rights – CRO (VR)\nThe CRO receives deferred share rights instead of performance rights to preserve the independence of the role and to minimise any conflicts of interest in carrying out the risk control function across the organisation.\nThe CRO’s deferred share rights are subject to a time-based vesting hurdle of four years. The value the Board uses to determine the number of deferred share rights to be allocated to the CRO is the face value of the Company’s shares traded on the ASX at the time of grant (five trading day VWAP).\n6.3 MALUS (DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT OF PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED REMUNERATION) – BOARD DISCRETION\nAll deferred remuneration we award to an employee is subject to ANZ’s on-going and absolute discretion to adjust this downward (malus) (including to zero) at any time.\nANZ may exercise this discretion, for example, where:\nthere is a need to protect the financial soundness of ANZ or to meet regulatory requirements or there has been a material failure of risk management or controls within ANZ;\nthe employee has acted fraudulently or dishonestly, failed to act with due care, skill and diligence, or failed to comply with ANZ policies (including the Code of Conduct), processes or directions;\nthe employee is responsible or accountable, directly or indirectly, by virtue of their role or seniority for an occurrence/event which has had an adverse impact on ANZ;\nthere has been misconduct and the employee was involved directly or indirectly, failed to take adequate steps, could be considered responsible due to their seniority, or the decision to award or grant the deferred remuneration was made on the basis of misinformation.\nFurther, where the CEO and/or Disclosed Executives of ANZ have failed to comply with their accountability obligations under the BEAR, their deferred remuneration will be reduced by an amount that is proportionate to the failure, as required by the BEAR.\nAn employee’s deferred remuneration is also subject to ANZ’s on-going and absolute discretion to further defer the vesting. Where ANZ exercises this discretion, the vesting date is postponed and will not vest unless and until ANZ determines it should vest.\nBefore any scheduled release of deferred remuneration, the Board (for the CEO and Disclosed Executives) and/or the CRG (for other employees) considers whether malus/downward adjustment or further deferral should be applied.\n87\n7. ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONSEQUENCE FRAMEWORK\nThis year we further strengthened the way we deal with material risk events through an enhanced Accountability and Consequence Framework.\nThe Consequence Review Group (CRG) is chaired by the CEO and members include the CRO, CFO, GE T&C and GGM IA. The CRG oversees the implementation and ongoing effectiveness of ANZ’s Accountability and Consequence Framework, being cognisant of its impact on the culture of ANZ. The CRG reviews material events, accountability and the application of suitable consequences (the HR Committee and Board determine accountability and consequences for the CEO and Disclosed Executives). Appropriate consequences are determined in light of the severity of the issue and may include, for example, one or more of the following: coaching, counselling, formal warnings, impacts to performance and remuneration outcomes, impacts on promotion, application of malus and ultimately termination of employment for the most serious issues. Our ongoing focus on accountability, consequences and driving a strong risk culture supports our customer commitment that when things go wrong, we fix them quickly and consistently hold executives, current (and former where we can), to account where appropriate.\nIn 2019 across the Group, 151 employees were terminated for breaches of our Code of Conduct. A further 516 employees received a formal disciplinary outcome, with managers required to apply impacts to their performance and remuneration outcomes as part of the annual review process.\nANZ announced in June 2019 that David Hisco would depart ANZ. The Board noted their concerns regarding the characterisation of certain transactions following an internal review of personal expenses. This was a clear and public example of the application of meaningful consequences. David’s employment was ceased, he was awarded no variable remuneration for 2019 and he immediately forfeited all unvested deferred remuneration which totalled around $7.4 million. This provided a clear message both internally and externally of the importance of doing the right thing and that this is expected of all our people regardless of seniority.\nNo malus was applied to the previously deferred remuneration of the CEO and Disclosed Executives during 2019. As disclosed in 2018 malus (downward adjustment) was applied to the unvested equity held by former Disclosed Executives.\nWe also seek to support a strong ‘speak up’ culture and ensure managers recognise exemplary risk and audit behaviours. The focus on speak up is being supported through our New Ways of Leading (NWOL) that are aligned with our purpose and values. NWOL focuses on five behaviours relevant for all employees and imperative for people leaders: be curious, create shared clarity, empower people, connect with empathy and grow people selflessly. We are incorporating culture into leader-led team activities to facilitate open, purposeful conversations about our culture and practices and create a psychologically safe environment for employees to speak up. We continue to raise employee awareness of, and promote the various ways that employees can speak up including through initiatives such as the Whistleblower Awareness Week.\nAt the senior leadership level, 30 current or former senior leaders (senior executives, executives and senior managers) had consequences applied in 2019 for Code of Conduct breaches or findings of accountability for a material event, or otherwise left the bank after an investigation had been initiated. The 30 employees represent ~1% of the senior leader population. The consequences applied included warnings, impacts to performance and/or remuneration outcomes and cessation of employment.\nSENIOR LEADER CONSEQUENCES IN 20191\nPerformance and remuneration consequence\nFormal warnings\nNo longer employed\nWhere employees role model the ANZ values and exemplary risk management we also seek to recognise and reward this, including through our annual Performance and Remuneration Review.\n1.\nIndividuals are included under all categories that are relevant meaning one individual may be reflected in multiple categories.\n8. NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR (NED) REMUNERATION\n8.1 REMUNERATION STRUCTURE\nThe Board reviewed NED fees for 2019 and determined once again not to increase their fees (which remain unchanged from 2016).\nAs disclosed in last year’s Remuneration Report, the NEDs who served on the Board in 2018 agreed to a 20% reduction of their Board fee for 2019 (20% reduction to the Chairman fee from $825,000 to $660,000, and 20% reduction to the NED member fee from $240,000 to $192,000) as a consequence for the shared accountability for the failures highlighted by the Royal Commission.\nNEDs receive a base fee for being a Director of the Board, and additional fees for either chairing, or being a member of a Board Committee. The Chairman of the Board does not receive additional fees for serving on a Board Committee.\nIn setting Board and Committee fees, the Board considers: general industry practice, corporate governance principles, the responsibilities and risks attached to the NED role, the time commitment expected of NEDs on Group and Company matters, and fees paid to NEDs of comparable companies.\nANZ compares NED fees to a comparator group of Australian listed companies with a similar market capitalisation, with particular focus on the major financial services institutions. This is considered an appropriate group, given similarity in size, nature of work and time commitment by NEDs.\n88\n23\n12\n7\nTo maintain NED independence and impartiality:\nNED fees are not linked to the performance of the Group; and\nNEDs are not eligible to participate in any of the Group’s variable remuneration arrangements.\nThe current aggregate fee pool for NEDs of $4 million was approved by shareholders at the 2012 AGM. The annual total of NEDs’ fees, including superannuation contributions, is within this agreed limit.\nThis table shows the NED fee policy structure for 2019:\nBoard1, 2\nBoard fee after reduction1, 2\nAudit Committee\nRisk Committee\nHR Committee\nDigital Business & Technology Committee\nEthics, Environment, Social & Governance Committee\nChair fee\n$825,000\n$660,000\n$65,000\n$62,000\n$57,000\n$35,000\n$35,000\nMember fee\n$240,000\n$192,000\n$32,500\n$31,000\n$29,000\n$15,000\n$15,000\n1.\nIncluding superannuation.\n2. The Chairman of the Board does not receive additional fees for serving on a Board Committee.\nNED shareholding guidelines\nWe expect our NEDs to hold ANZ shares. NEDs are required:\nto accumulate shares – over a five-year period from their appointment – to the value of 100% (200% for the Chairman) of the NED member fee; and\nto maintain this shareholding while they are a Director of ANZ.\nAll NEDs have met or, if appointed within the last five years, are on track to meet their minimum shareholding requirement.\n8.2 2019 STATUTORY REMUNERATION - NEDS\nFinancial year\nSHORT-TERM NED BENEFITS\nFees1 $\nNon monetary benefits $\nPOST-EMPLOYMENT Super contributions1 $\nTotal remuneration2 $\nCurrent Non-Executive Directors\nD Gonski\n2019\n639,351\n\n20,649\n660,000\n2018\n804,831\n\n20,169\n825,000\nI Atlas\n2019\n275,851\n\n20,649\n296,500\n2018\n324,331\n\n20,169\n344,500\nP Dwyer\n2019\n296,351\n\n20,649\n317,000\n2018\n344,831\n\n20,169\n365,000\nJ Halton\n2019\n246,058\n\n20,649\n266,707\n2018\n277,567\n\n20,169\n297,736\nJ Key3\n2019\n229,131\n\n20,649\n249,780\n2018\n148,546\n\n11,996\n160,542\nG Liebelt\n2019\n294,851\n\n20,649\n315,500\n2018\n345,858\n\n20,169\n366,027\nJ Macfarlane\n2019\n249,851\n\n20,649\n270,500\n2018\n298,331\n\n20,169\n318,500\nFormer Non-Executive Director\nH Lee4\n2019\n57,258\n4,832\n5,133\n67,223\n2018\n314,831\n\n20,169\n335,000\nTotal of all Non-Executive Directors\n2019\n2,288,702\n4,832\n149,676\n2,443,210\n2018\n2,859,126\n\n153,179\n3,012,305\n1.

Long-term benefits and share-based payments do not apply for the NEDs. 3.\nJ Key commenced as a NED for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZBGL) on 28 February 2018, so 2018 remuneration reflects a partial service year. In addition for 2018, in relation to his Non-Executive Directorship from 18 October 2017 for ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited, J Key also received a total of NZD 302,925 as a NED until 31 December 2017 and from 1 January 2018 as Chairman. In 2019, J Key also received a total of NZD 382,950 as Chairman for ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited.\n4. H Lee retired as a NED on 19 December 2018, so 2019 remuneration reflects partial service year up to his date of retirement. Non monetary benefits relate to gifts on retirement including Fringe Benefits Tax.\n89\n9. REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE\n9.1 THE HUMAN RESOURCES (HR) COMMITTEE\n9.1.2 Link between remuneration and risk\n9.1.1 Role of the HR Committee\nThe HR Committee supports the Board on remuneration and other HR matters. It reviews the remuneration policies and practices of the Group, and monitors market practice and regulatory and compliance requirements in Australia and overseas.\nTo further reflect the importance of the link between remuneration and risk:\nthe Board had two NEDs (in addition to the Chairman) in 2019 who served on both the HR Committee and the Risk Committee; and\nThe HR Committee has a strong focus on the relationship between business performance, risk management and remuneration, aligned with our business strategy. The chairs of the Risk and Audit Committees are members of the HR Committee and often the full Board is in attendance for specific HR Committee meetings. During the year the HR Committee met on six occasions and reviewed and approved, or made recommendations to the Board on matters including:\nthe HR Committee has free and unfettered access to risk and financial control personnel (the CRO and CFO attend HR Committee meetings for specific agenda items).\n9.1.3 External advisors provided information but not recommendations\nThe HR Committee can engage independent external advisors as needed.\nremuneration for the CEO and other key executives (broader than those disclosed in the Remuneration Report) covered by the ANZBGL Remuneration Policy and ANZ NZ Remuneration Policy, and fees for the NEDs;\nthe design of significant variable remuneration plans – for example: the ANZIP – and the progress of the implementation of changes in Divisional Business Unit Incentive Plans in response to the industry-wide Retail Remuneration Review by Stephen Sedgwick AO;\nThroughout the year, the HR Committee and management received information from the following external providers: Aon, Ashurst, EY, Mercer Consulting (Australia) Pty Ltd, Morrow Sodali and PricewaterhouseCoopers. This information related to market data, market practices, legislative requirements and the interpretation of governance and regulatory requirements.\nDuring the year, ANZ did not receive any remuneration recommendations from external consultants about the remuneration of KMP.\nthe design and implementation of Reimagining Reward – an organisational-wide change to our approach to remuneration, performance management and recognition, which supports positive risk culture and includes the redesign of how we manage and reward our people to better focus on the interests of our customers, and the long-term health of our bank and team, rather than individual outcomes;\nANZ employs in-house remuneration professionals who provide recommendations to the HR Committee and the Board. The Board made its decisions independently, using the information provided and with careful regard to ANZ’s strategic objectives, purpose and values, risk appetite and the ANZBGL Remuneration Policy and Principles.\n9.2 INTERNAL GOVERNANCE\nthe ANZ Group Performance Framework (annual objectives setting and assessment) and annual variable remuneration spend;\nperformance and reward outcomes for key senior executives, including the consideration of malus/downward adjustment;\n9.2.1 Hedging prohibition\nAll deferred equity must remain at risk until it has fully vested. Accordingly, executives and their associated persons must not enter into any schemes that specifically protect the unvested value of equity allocated. If they do so, then they forfeit the relevant equity.\nkey senior executive appointments and terminations;\n9.2.2 CEO and Disclosed Executives’ shareholding guidelines\nthe effectiveness of the ANZBGL Remuneration Policy and changes to the policy to incorporate the BEAR requirements;\nWe expect the CEO and each Disclosed Executive to, over a five-year period:\nsuccession plans for key senior executives;\naccumulate ANZ shares to the value of 200% of their fixed\nculture and governance including endorsing a new culture accountability model and the strengthened Accountability and Consequence Framework; and\nculture and governance including endorsing a new culture accountability model and the strengthened Accountability and Consequence Framework; and\nmaintain this shareholding level while they are an executive of ANZ.\ndiversity, inclusion, and employee engagement.\nMore details about the role of the HR Committee, including its Charter, can be found on our website. Go to anz.com > Our company > Strong governance framework > ANZ Human Resources Committee Charter.\nFor this purpose, shareholdings include all vested and unvested equity that is not subject to performance hurdles. Based on equity holdings as at 30 September 2019, the CEO and all Disclosed Executives:\nwho have been with us for at least five years, meet this requirement; and\nwho have been with us for less than five years, are on track to meet it.\n90\n9.2.3 CEO and Disclosed Executives’ contract terms and equity treatment\nThe details of the contract terms and also the equity treatment on termination (in accordance with the Conditions of Grant) relating to the CEO and Disclosed Executives are below. Although they are similar, they vary in some cases to suit different circumstances.\nType of contract\nPermanent ongoing employment contract.\nNotice on resignation\n12 months by CEO;\n6 months by Disclosed Executives;\n3 months by Acting Group Executive and CEO, NZ.\nNotice on termination by ANZ\n12 months by ANZ for CEO and Disclosed Executives;\n3 months by ANZ for Acting Group Executive and CEO, NZ.\nHowever, ANZ may immediately terminate an individual’s employment at any time in the case of serious misconduct. In that case, the individual will be entitled only to payment of fixed remuneration up to the date of their termination and their statutory entitlements.\nHow unvested equity is treated on leaving ANZ\nExecutives who resign or are terminated will forfeit all their unvested deferred equity – unless the Board determines otherwise.\nIf an executive is terminated due to redundancy or they are classified as a ‘good leaver’, then:\ntheir deferred shares/share rights are released at the original vesting date; and\ntheir performance rights1 are prorated for service to the full notice termination date and released at the original vesting date (to the extent that the performance hurdles are met).\nOn an executive’s death or total and permanent disablement, their deferred equity vests.\nUnvested equity remains subject to malus post termination.\nChange of control (applies to the CEO only)\nIf a change of control or other similar event occurs, then we will test the performance conditions applying to the CEO’s performance rights. They will vest to the extent that the performance conditions are satisfied.\n1. Or deferred share rights granted to the CRO instead of performance rights.\n91\n10. OTHER INFORMATION\n10.1 2019 STATUTORY REMUNERATION – CEO AND DISCLOSED EXECUTIVES\nThe following table outlines the statutory remuneration disclosed in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards. While it shows the fixed remuneration awarded (cash and superannuation contributions) and also the cash component of the 2019 variable remuneration award, it does not show the actual variable remuneration awarded or received in 2019 (see sections 5.1 and 5.2), but instead shows the amortised accounting value for this financial year of deferred remuneration (including prior year awards).\nSHORT-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\nPOST-EMPLOYMENT\nFinancial year\nCash salary1 $\nNon monetary benefits2 $\nTotal cash incentive3 $\nOther cash4 $\nSuper contributions5 $\nRetirement benefit accrued during year6 $\nCEO and Current Disclosed Executives\nS Elliott\n2019\n2,079,351\n19,383\n750,000\n\n20,649\n\n2018\n2,079,831\n17,321\n875,000\n\n20,169\n\nM Carnegie9\n2019\n979,351\n32,221\n495,000\n\n21,149\n\n2018\n979,831\n29,254\n528,000\n\n20,669\n\nK Corbally10\n2019\n929,351\n16,633\n478,500\n\n20,649\n\n2018\n472,582\n6,383\n164,835\n\n10,145\n\nA George11\n2019\n979,351\n37,721\n528,000\n\n21,149\n\n2018\n843,584\n40,254\n354,750\n250,000\n20,669\n\nM Hand12\n2019\n710,307\n10,868\n198,000\n\n15,693\n17,851\nM Jablko13\n2019\n979,351\n17,083\n544,500\n\n21,149\n\n2018\n979,831\n15,341\n577,500\n\n20,669\n\nA Watson14, 15\n2019\n214,999\n273\n170,255\n\n4,441\n\nM Whelan\n2019\n1,179,351\n13,883\n874,500\n\n20,649\n\n2018\n1,179,831\n11,821\n717,750\n\n20,169\n\nFormer Disclosed Executives\nD Hisco15, 16\n2019\n746,754\n246,687\n\n\n96,767\n\n2018\n1,168,324\n477,076\n644,397\n\n2,389\n2,305\nF Ohlsson17\n2019\n235,044\n24,143\n\n\n4,956\n\n2018\n979,831\n31,668\n396,000\n\n20,169\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\nCash salary includes any adjustments required to reflect the use of ANZ's Lifestyle Leave Policy for the period in the KMP role. Non monetary benefits generally consist of company-funded benefits (and the associated Fringe Benefits Tax) such as car parking, taxation services and costs met by the Company in relation to relocation and cessation. The total cash incentive relates to the cash component only. The relevant amortisation of the AVR/VR deferred components is included in share-based payments and has been amortised over the vesting period. The total AVR/VR was approved by the Board on 25 October 2019. 100% of the cash component of the AVR/VR awarded for the 2018 and 2019 years vested to the executive in the applicable financial year. Other cash and other equity allocations relate to employment arrangements such as compensation for bonus opportunity foregone and deferred remuneration forfeited, retention awards, and shares received in relation to the Employee Share Offer. For further details, see the individual footnotes for each relevant executive. For all Australian based executives, the 2018 and 2019 superannuation contributions reflect the Superannuation Guarantee Contribution based on the Maximum Contribution Base. From 31 August 2018, D Hisco commenced superannuation contributions to KiwiSaver where ANZ provides an employer contribution matching member contributions up to 4% of total gross pay (less employer superannuation contribution tax). A Watson also participates in KiwiSaver.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\nAccrual relates to Retirement Allowance. As a result of being employed with ANZ before November 1992, M Hand is, and D Hisco was eligible to receive a Retirement Allowance on retirement, retrenchment, death, or resignation for illness, incapacity or domestic reasons. The Retirement Allowance is calculated as three months of preserved notional salary (which is 65% of fixed remuneration) plus an additional 3% of notional salary for each year of full-time service above 10 years less the total accrual value of long service leave (including taken and untaken). As required by AASB 2 Share-based payments, the amortisation value includes a proportion of the fair value (taking into account market-related vesting conditions) of all equity that had not yet fully vested as at the commencement of the financial year. The fair value is determined at grant date and is allocated on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period. The amount included as remuneration neither relates to, nor indicates, the benefit (if any) that the executive may ultimately realise if the equity becomes exercisable. Termination benefits reflect payment for accrued annual leave, long service leave and pay in lieu of notice in accordance with contract, payable on cessation. 2018 other equity allocations for M Carnegie relate to previously disclosed compensation for bonus opportunity foregone and deferred remuneration forfeited. K Corbally commenced in a Disclosed Executive role on 19 March 2018. So his 2018 remuneration reflects a partial service year.

As disclosed in 2017, in relation to A George's role before her appointment to the Group Executive Committee, in July 2016 the Board approved a cash retention award of $500,000 with partial vesting in June 2017 ($250,000) and December 2017 ($250,000). M Hand commenced in a Disclosed Executive role on 29 December 2018. So his 2019 remuneration reflects a partial service year. M Hand's fixed remuneration was adjusted on 1 March 2019 on appointment to the Group Executive, Australia Retail and Commercial Banking role. Other cash and other equity allocations for M Jablko relate to previously disclosed compensation for bonus opportunity foregone and deferred remuneration forfeited. A Watson commenced in a Disclosed Executive role on 17 June 2019. So her 2019 remuneration reflects a partial service year. A Watson's fixed remuneration is paid in NZD and converted to AUD. In 2016 A Watson, D Hisco and F Ohlsson, and in 2018 and 2019 A Watson and D Hisco, were eligible to receive shares under the Employee Share Offer. That offer provides a grant of ANZ shares in each financial year to eligible employees subject to Board approval. See Note 31 Employee Share and Option Plans for further details on the Employee Share Offer.\nD Hisco ceased employment 14 June 2019. Remuneration reflects up to his date of cessation (noting his annual fixed remuneration for 2019 remained unchanged at NZD 1.274 million). Share-based payments include the expensing treatment on cessation for unvested deferred remuneration (including reversals for forfeiture on cessation). D Hisco's fixed remuneration was paid in NZD and converted to AUD. Termination benefits reflect payment for accrued annual leave, long service leave and pay in lieu of notice in accordance with his contract, payable on cessation. Following an internal review it was determined that certain expense and allowances previously provided to D Hisco and categorised as business related would more appropriately be characterised as non-business related and included as non monetary benefits in the Remuneration Report. The 2018 comparative balances have been restated to increase non monetary benefits by $8,360 plus related Fringe Benefit Tax of $4,117. Similar items existed in the period between 2010-2017 which would have increased the non monetary benefits disclosed for D Hisco on average each year by approximately $44,580 plus related Fringe Benefit Tax of $21,956.\n11.\n16.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n17. F Ohlsson concluded in his role 28 December 2018. Remuneration reflects up to his date of conclusion in role (noting his annual fixed remuneration for 2019 remained unchanged at $1 million).\n15.\n93\n10.2 EQUITY HOLDINGS\nFor the equity granted to the CEO and Disclosed Executives in November/December 2018, all deferred shares were purchased on the market.

The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements. Subject to APRA approval, the Group expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. The impact of the reduction in price has been reflected in the 2019 financial results.\nOther than the matter above, there have been no significant events from 30 September 2019 to the date of signing this report.\nPolitical donations Our policy is that we will make an annual donation to the two major federal parties to support the democratic process in Australia. In the 2019 calendar year, we donated $100,000 to the Liberal Party of Australia and $100,000 to the Australian Labor Party.\nEnvironmental regulation ANZ recognises the expectations of its stakeholders – customers, shareholders, staff and the community – to operate in a way that mitigates its environmental impact.\nIn Australia, ANZ meets the requirements of the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (Cth), which imposes reporting obligations where energy production, usage or greenhouse gas emissions trigger specified thresholds.\nANZ holds a licence under the Water Act 1989 (Vic), allowing it to extract water from the Yarra River for thermal regulation of its Melbourne head office building. The licence specifies daily and annual limits for the extraction of water from the Yarra River with which ANZ fully complies. The extraction of river water reduces reliance on the high quality potable water supply and is one of several environmental initiatives that ANZ has introduced at its Melbourne head office building.\nThe Group does not believe that its operations are subject to any particular and significant environmental regulation under a law of the Commonwealth of Australia or of an Australian State or Territory. It may become subject to environmental regulation as a result of its lending activities in the ordinary course of business and has developed policies to identify and manage such environmental matters.\nHaving made due enquiry, and to the best of ANZ’s knowledge, no entity of the Group has incurred any material environmental liability during the year.\nFurther details of ANZ’s environmental performance, including progress against its targets and details of its emissions profile, are available on anz.com>About us>Corporate Sustainability.\nCorporate Governance Statement ANZ is committed to maintaining a high standard in its governance framework. ANZ confirms it has followed the ASX Corporate Governance Council’s Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (3rd edition) during the 2019 financial year. ANZ’s Corporate Governance Statement, together with the ASX Appendix 4G which relates to the Corporate Governance Statement, can be viewed at anz.com/corporategovernance and has been lodged with the ASX.\nPillar 3 information ANZ provides information required by APS 330: Public Disclosure in the Regulatory Disclosures section at www.anz.com/shareholder/ centre/reporting/regulatory-disclosure/\nNon-audit services The Group’s Stakeholder Engagement Model for Relationship with the External Auditor (the Policy), which incorporates requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and industry best practice, prevents the external auditor from providing services that are perceived to be in conflict with the role of the external auditor or breach independence requirements. This includes consulting advice and sub-contracting of operational activities normally undertaken by management, and engagements where the external auditor may ultimately be required to express an opinion on its own work.\nSpecifically the Policy:\nlimits the scope of non-audit services that may be provided;\nrequires that audit, audit-related and permitted non-audit services be considered in light of independence requirements and for any potential conflicts of interest before they are approved by the Audit Committee, or approved by the Chair of the Audit Committee (or delegate) and notified to the Audit Committee; and\nrequires pre-approval before the external auditor can commence any engagement for the Group.\nFurther details about the Policy can be found in the Corporate Governance Statement.\nThe external auditor has confirmed to the Audit Committee that it has:\nimplemented procedures to ensure it complies with independence rules in applicable jurisdictions; and\ncomplied with applicable policies and regulations in those jurisdictions regarding the provision of non-audit services, and the Policy.\nThe Audit Committee has reviewed the non-audit services provided by the external auditor during the 2019 financial year, and has confirmed that the provision of these services is consistent with the Policy, compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 and did not compromise the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001. This has been formally advised by the Audit Committee to the Board of Directors.\n99\nDirectors’ Report (continued)\nThe categories of non-audit services supplied to the Group during the year ended 30 September 2019 by the external auditor, KPMG, or by another person or firm on KPMG’s behalf, and the amounts paid or payable (including GST) by the Group are as follows:\nAmount paid/payable $’000\nDuring the financial year, the Company has paid premiums for insurance for the benefit of the Directors and employees of the Company and related bodies corporate of the Company. In accordance with common commercial practice, the insurance prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liability insured against and the amount of the premium.\nNon-audit services\nGeneral market or regulatory insights\nTraining related services\nControls related assessments\n2019\n–\n106\n–\n2018\n187\n17\n94\nKey management personnel and employee share and option plans The Remuneration Report contains details of Non-Executive Directors, Chief Executive Officer and Disclosed Executives’ equity holdings and options/rights issued during the 2019 financial year and as at the date of this report.\nMethodology and procedural reviews\n10\n10\nTotal\n116\nFurther details on the compensation paid to KPMG is provided in Note 34 Compensation of Auditors to the financial statements including details of audit-related services provided during the year of $5.71 million (2018: $6.28 million).\n308\nNote 31 Employee Share and Option Plans to the 2019 Financial Report contains details of the 2019 financial year and as at the date of this report:\nOptions/rights issued over shares granted to employees;\nShares issued as a result of the exercise of options/rights granted to employees; and\nFor the reasons set out above, the Directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor during the year ended 30 September 2019 is compatible with the general standard of independence for external auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 and did not compromise the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001.\nOther details about share options/rights issued, including any rights to participate in any share issues of the Company.\nThe names of all persons who currently hold options/rights are entered in the register kept by the Company pursuant to section 170 of the Corporations Act 2001.

ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThese are the financial statements for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (the Company) and its controlled entities (together, ‘the Group’ or ‘ANZ’) for the year ended 30 September 2019. The Company is incorporated and domiciled in Australia. The address of the Company’s registered office and its principal place of business is ANZ Centre, 833 Collins Street, Docklands, Victoria, Australia 3008.\nOn 30 October 2019, the Directors resolved to authorise the issue of these financial statements.\nInformation in the financial statements is included only to the extent we consider it material and relevant to the understanding of the financial statements. A disclosure is considered material and relevant if, for example:\nthe amount is significant in size (quantitative factor);\nthe information is significant by nature (qualitative factor);\nthe user cannot understand the Group’s results without the specific disclosure (qualitative factor);\nthe information is critical to a user’s understanding of the impact of significant changes in the Group’s business during the period - for example, business acquisitions or disposals (qualitative factor);\nthe information relates to an aspect of the Group’s operations that is important to its future performance (qualitative factor); and\nthe information is required under legislative requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, the Banking Act 1959 (Cth) or by the Group’s principal regulators, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).\nThis section of the financial statements:\noutlines the basis upon which the Group’s financial statements have been prepared; and\ndiscusses any new accounting standards or regulations that directly impact the financial statements.\nBASIS OF PREPARATION\nThis financial report is a general purpose (Tier 1) financial report prepared by a ‘for profit’ entity, in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards (AASs) and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), the Corporations Act 2001, and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\nWe present the financial statements of the Group in Australian dollars, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. We have rounded values to the nearest million dollars ($m), unless otherwise stated, as allowed under the ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors Report) Instrument 2016/191. We measure the financial statements of each entity in the Group using the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates (the functional currency).\nBASIS OF MEASUREMENT\nWe have prepared the financial information in accordance with the historical cost basis - except the following assets and liabilities which we have stated at their fair value:\nderivative financial instruments and in the case of fair value hedging, a fair value adjustment is made on the underlying hedged exposure;\nfinancial instruments held for trading;\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss;\navailable-for-sale financial assets (prior to 1 October 2018);\nfinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (applicable from 1 October 2018); and\ncertain other assets and liabilities held for sale where the fair value less costs of disposal is less than their carrying value (excludes assets and liabilities held for sale which are exempt from this requirement).\nIn accordance with AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts (AASB 1038) we have measured life insurance liabilities using the Margin on Services (MoS) model. In accordance with AASB 119 Employee Benefits (AASB 119) we have measured defined benefit obligations using the Projected Unit Credit Method.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nThe aligned dealer groups business sold to IOOF Holdings Limited (IOOF) completed on 1 October 2018; the life insurance business sold to Zurich Financial Services Australia Limited completed on 31 May 2019; and the Wealth Australia pensions and investments business sold to IOOF and associated Group reclassification and consolidation impacts are treated as discontinued operations from a financial reporting perspective. These businesses qualify as discontinued operations, which are a subset of assets held for sale, as they represent a major line of business. The results of the divested businesses have been included in the ‘Profit/(Loss) from discontinued operations’ until their divestment date. The Balance Sheet is not restated when a business is reclassified as a discontinued operation.\n107\n107\nANZ 2018 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n1. ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nBASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries. An entity, including a structured entity, is considered a subsidiary of the Group when we determine that the Company has control over the entity. Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. We assess power by examining existing rights that give the Group the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity. We have eliminated, on consolidation, the effect of all transactions between entities in the Group.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\nTRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES Foreign currency transactions are translated into the relevant functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the relevant spot rate. Any foreign currency translation gains or losses that arise are included in profit or loss in the period they arise.\nWe measure translation differences on non-monetary items at fair value through profit or loss and report them as part of the fair value gain or loss on these items. We include any translation differences on non-monetary items classified as investment securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (applicable from 1 October 2018 ) and non-monetary items classified as available-for-sale financial assets in the available-for- sale revaluation reserve in equity (applicable prior to 1 October 2018).\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS THAT HAVE A FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY THAT IS NOT AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS The financial statements of our foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars for consolidation into the Group Financial Statements using the following method:\nForeign currency item\nExchange rate used\nAssets and liabilities\nThe reporting date rate\nEquity\nThe initial investment date rate\nIncome and expenses\nThe average rate for the period – but if for a significant transaction we believe the average rate is not reasonable, then we use the transaction date rate\nExchange differences arising from the translation of financial statements of foreign operations are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. When we dispose of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences are transferred to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on sale.\nFIDUCIARY ACTIVITIES\nThe Group provides fiduciary services to third parties including custody, nominee, trustee, administration and investment management services predominantly through the wealth businesses. This involves the Group holding assets on behalf of third parties and making decisions regarding the purchase and sale of financial instruments. If ANZ is not the beneficial owner or does not control the assets, then we do not recognise these transactions in these financial statements, except when required by accounting standards or another legislative requirement.\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nIn the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made a number of judgements and applied estimates and assumptions about past and future events. Further information on the key judgements and estimates that we consider material to the financial statements are contained within the relevant notes to the financial statements.\n108\n108\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED IN THE PERIOD\nAASB 9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (AASB 9)\nThe Group has applied AASB 9 effective from 1 October 2018 (with the exception of the ‘own credit’ requirements relating to financial liabilities designated as measured at fair value, which were early adopted by the Group effective from 1 October 2013). In addition, the Group chose to early adopt AASB 2017-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (AASB 2017-6) effective from 1 October 2018. AASB 9 provides an accounting policy choice, which the Group has taken in current period, to continue to apply the AASB 139 hedge accounting requirements until the International Accounting Standards Board’s ongoing project on macro hedge accounting is completed.\nAASB 9 and AASB 2017-6 stipulate new requirements for the impairment of financial assets, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and general hedge accounting. Details of the key requirements are outlined within the Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities sections on pages 125 and 144 respectively, and a reconciliation of the transitional impact of adopting the standard at 1 October 2018 is set out in Note 35.\nAASB 15 REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (AASB 15)\nThe Group adopted AASB 15 from 1 October 2018 which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements. The standard requires identification of distinct performance obligations within a contract, and allocation of the transaction price of the contract to those performance obligations. Revenue is then recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied. The standard also provides guidance on whether an entity is acting as a principal or an agent which impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis. In accordance with the transitional provisions of AASB 15, the Group has adopted the full retrospective transition approach. Under this approach, the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard has been recognised as an adjustment to opening retained earnings as at 1 October 2017 and comparative information for the 2018 reporting period has been restated.\nThe adoption of AASB 15 resulted in the following changes in accounting policy:\nRecognition of trail commission revenue: trail commission revenue previously recognised over time is now recognised at the time the Group initially distributes the underlying product to the customer where it is highly probable the revenue will not need to be reversed in future periods.\nThis policy change resulted in an increase to the opening balances of Other assets of $32 million, Deferred tax liabilities of $10 million and Retained earnings of $22 million as at 1 October 2017 to recognise revenue that qualifies for upfront recognition under AASB 15 but was not previously recognised under AASB 118 Revenue (AASB 118). The change did not impact net profit or earnings per share in the comparative periods.\nPresentation: Certain credit card loyalty costs and other costs will be presented as operating expenses where the Group has assessed that it is acting as principal (rather than an agent). Previously these costs were presented as a reduction of other operating income. In addition, certain incentives received from card scheme providers related to card marketing activities will be presented as operating income where the Group has assessed that it is acting as principal (rather than an agent). Previously these incentives were presented as a reduction of operating expenses. The presentation of these costs under AASB 15 increased other operating income and operating expenses by $153 million in 2018. The changes did not impact net profit or earnings per share in the comparative periods.\nA minor balance sheet reclassification associated with credit card loyalty programs is set out in Note 35.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT EARLY ADOPTED A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been published but are not mandatory for the financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2019, and have not been applied by the Group in preparing these financial statements. Further details of these are set out below.\nGENERAL HEDGE ACCOUNTING\nAASB 9 introduces new hedge accounting requirements which more closely align accounting with risk management activities undertaken when hedging financial and non-financial risks. AASB 9 provides the Group with an accounting policy choice to continue to apply the AASB 139 hedge accounting requirements until the International Accounting Standards Board’s ongoing project on macro hedge accounting is completed. The Group currently applies the hedge accounting requirements of AASB 139.\nAASB 16 LEASES (AASB 16)\nAASB 16 is effective for the Group from 1 October 2019 and replaces the previous standard AASB 117 Leases (AASB 117). AASB 16 primarily impacts the Group’s property and technology leases which were previously classified as operating leases. Under AASB 117, operating leases were not recognised on balance sheet and rent payments were expensed over the lease term.\nUnder AASB 16, lessees must recognise all leases (except for leases of low value assets and short term leases) on balance sheet under a single accounting model. Accordingly, the Group will recognise its right to use an underlying leased asset over the lease term as a right-of-use (ROU) asset, and its obligation to make lease payments as a lease liability. In the income statement, the Group will recognise depreciation expense on the ROU asset and interest expense on the lease liability. As a result, lease expenses will be higher in the early periods of a lease and lower in the later periods of the lease compared to the previous standard where expenses were constant over the lease term. Cumulative expenses over the life of a lease will not change.\n109\n109\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n1. ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nThe Group will apply the modified retrospective transition approach whereby initial lease liabilities are recognised based on the present value of remaining lease payments as of the transition date. The initial ROU asset recognised for certain large commercial and retail leases will be measured as if AASB 16 had always been applied to the leases. For all other leases, the initial ROU asset will be measured as equal to the initial lease liability. Based on this transition approach, the Group expects to recognise an increase in liabilities of $1.7 billion and an increase in assets of $1.6 billion. This is expected to result in a reduction to opening retained earnings of $82 million and an increase in deferred tax assets of $43 million as of 1 October 2019. Comparative information from prior periods will not be restated.\nThe implementation of AASB 16 requires management to make certain key judgements including the determination of lease terms, discount rates and identifying arrangements that contain a lease. These estimates may be refined as the Group finalises its implementation of the standard in the first half of the 2020 financial year.\nAASB 17 INSURANCE CONTRACTS (AASB 17)\nThe final version of AASB 17 was issued in July 2017 and is not effective for the Group until 1 October 2021. It will replace AASB 4 Insurance Contracts, AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts and AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts. AASB 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts.\nThe measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements under AASB 17 are significantly different from current accounting standards. Although the overall profit recognised in respect of insurance contracts will not change, it is expected that the timing of profit recognition will change.\nThe impact of AASB 17 is not expected to have material impact on the Group.\nAASB INTERPRETATION 23 UNCERTAINTY OVER INCOME TAX TREATMENTS (INTERPRETATION 23)\nIn July 2017 the AASB issued Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments. The Interpretation clarifies application of recognition and measurement requirements in AASB 112 Income Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments.\nInterpretation 23 will apply to the Group from 1 October 2019, and is not expected to have a material impact on the Group.\nREVISED CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK\nIn June 2019 the AASB issued a revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting. The new Framework includes updated definitions and criteria for the recognition and derecognition of assets and liabilities. Additionally it introduces new concepts on measurement, including factors to consider when selecting a measurement basis. The revised Conceptual Framework will apply to the Group from 1 October 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Group.\nINTEREST RATE BENCHMARK REFORM\nInterbank offered rates (IBORs), such as LIBOR, are a key reference rate for derivatives, loans and securities for global financial markets. In response to concerns about the transparency and liquidity of IBOR rates, regulators in a number of jurisdictions across the globe are well advanced in developing benchmark rates to phase out and replace IBORs, these projects are collectively known as ‘IBOR Reform’. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is also considering the financial reporting implications of IBOR reform which is expected to impact elements of financial instrument accounting, including hedge accounting, loan modifications, fair value methodologies and disclosures.\nThe IASB project is split into two phases: Phase 1 deals with pre-replacement issues (issues affecting financial reporting in the period before the replacement of IBOR’s); and Phase 2 deals with replacement issues (issues affecting financial reporting when existing IBOR’s are replaced).\nIn September 2019, the IASB issued a final standard, Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 which focuses on ‘pre-rate replacement issues’ and provides exceptions to specific hedge accounting requirements under IAS 39 and IFRS 9 so that entities will be able to apply those hedge accounting requirements under an assumption that the interest rate benchmark is not altered as a result of the interest rate benchmark reform. In October 2019, AASB adopted these amendments in AASB 2019-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform.\nAlthough the Group anticipates the new standard, once adopted, will provide certain relief in relation to hedge accounting requirements, for 30 September 2019 reporting purposes, it has considered the existing portfolio of hedge accounted relationships in light of:\n\nthe significant uncertainty surrounding the method and timing of transition away from IBORs; and\n\nongoing application and reliance in capital markets on IBOR’s for financial instrument pricing.\nAs result of the above factors, the Group has concluded that continuation of hedge accounting relationships for potentially impacted hedge relationship remains appropriate.\nThe Group is considering the new standard which is effective on 1 October 2020 but may be adopted earlier.\n110\n110\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2.

Includes customer remediation of $212 million (2018: $228 million).\n2.\n3.\n111\n111\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n2. OPERATING INCOME (continued)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nNET INTEREST INCOME Interest Income and Expense We recognise interest income and expense for all financial instruments, including those classified as held for trading, assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (applicable from 1 October 2018), available-for-sale assets (applicable prior to 1 October 2018) or designated at fair value through profit or loss in net interest income. For assets held at amortised cost we use the effective interest rate method to calculate amortised cost. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the stream of estimated future cash receipts or payments over the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. For assets subject to prepayment, we determine their expected life on the basis of historical behaviour of the particular asset portfolio - taking into account contractual obligations and prepayment experience.\nWe recognise fees and costs, which form an integral part of the financial instrument (for example loan origination fees and costs), using the effective interest rate method. This is presented as part of interest income or expense depending on whether the underlying financial instrument is a financial asset or financial liability.\nMajor Bank Levy The Major Bank Levy Act 2017 (‘Levy’ or ‘Major bank levy’) applies a rate of 0.06% to certain liabilities of the Company. The Group has determined that the levy represents a finance cost for the Group and $363 million (2018: $355 million) is presented in interest expense in the Income Statement.\nOTHER OPERATING INCOME Fee and Commission Revenue We recognise fee and commission revenue arising from contracts with customers (a) over time when the performance obligation is satisfied across more than one reporting period or (b) at a point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied immediately or is satisfied within one reporting period.\nLending fees exclude fees treated as part of the effective yield calculation of interest income. Lending fees include certain guarantee and commitment fees where the loan or guarantee is not likely to be drawn upon, and other fees charged for providing customers a distinct good or service that are recognised separately from the underlying lending product (including annual package fees that provide benefits on other ANZ products).\nNon lending fees includes fees associated with deposit and credit card accounts, interchange fees and fees charged for specific customer transactions such as international money transfers. Where the Group provides multiple goods or services to a customer under the same contract, the Group allocates the transaction price of the contract to distinct performance obligations based on the relative stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation. Revenue is recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied.\nCommissions represent fees from third parties where ANZ acts as an agent by arranging a third party (e.g. an insurance provider) to provide goods and services to a customer. In such cases, ANZ is not primarily responsible for providing the underlying good or service to the customer. If the Group collects funds on behalf of a third party when acting as an agent, the Group only recognises the net commission it retains as revenue. When the commission is variable based on factors outside the control of the Group (e.g. a trail commission), revenue is only recognised if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of the variable amount will not be required in future periods.\nFunds management income represent fees earned from customers for providing financial advice and fees for asset management services and advice provided to investment funds. Revenue is recognised either at the point the financial advice is provided or over the period in which the asset management services are delivered. Performance fees associated with funds management activities are only recognised when it becomes highly probable the performance hurdle will be achieved.\nNet Foreign Exchange Earnings and Other Financial Instruments Income We recognise the following as net foreign exchange earnings and other financial instruments income:\nexchange rate differences arising on the settlement of monetary items and translation differences on monetary items translated at rates different to those at which they were initially recognised or included in a previous financial report;\nfair value movements (excluding realised and accrued interest) on derivatives that we use to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk on funding instruments not designated as accounting hedges;\nthe ineffective portions of fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges;\n112\n112\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. OPERATING INCOME (continued)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nimmediately upon sale or repayment of a hedged item, the unamortised fair value adjustments in items designated as fair value hedges and amounts accumulated in equity related to designated cash flow hedges;\nfair value movements on financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss or held for trading;\namounts released from the available-for-sale asset (AFS) revaluation reserve (applicable prior to 1 October 2018) when an available-for- sale asset is sold;\namounts released from the fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) reserve (applicable from 1 October 2018) when a debt instrument classified as FVOCI is sold; and\nthe gain or loss on derecognition of financial assets or liabilities measured at amortised cost.\nGain or Loss on Disposal of Non-Financial Assets The gain or loss on the disposal of assets is the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the proceeds of disposal net of costs. This is recognised in other income in the year in which the significant risks and rewards transfer to the buyer.\nNET INCOME FROM INSURANCE BUSINESS We recognise:\npremiums received (net of reinsurance premiums paid) based on an assessment of the likely pattern in which risk will emerge over the term of the policies written.

On adoption of AASB 15, the Group reclassified certain items previously netted which are now presented gross in operating income and operating expenses. Comparative information has been restated accordingly which increased total operating expense by $153 million for 2018. Includes customer remediation expenses of $373 million in 2019 (2018: $191 million).\n2.\n3. 2018 includes an accelerated amortisation expense of $251 million.\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nOPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses are recognised as services are provided to the Group over the period in which an asset is consumed or once a liability is created.\nSALARIES AND RELATED COSTS - ANNUAL LEAVE, LONG SERVICE LEAVE AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Wages and salaries, annual leave and other employee entitlements expected to be paid or settled within twelve months of employees rendering service are measured at their nominal amounts using remuneration rates that the Group expects to pay when the liabilities are settled.\nWe accrue employee entitlements relating to long service leave using an actuarial calculation. It includes assumptions regarding staff departures, leave utilisation and future salary increases. The result is then discounted using market yields at the reporting date. The market yields are determined from a blended rate of high quality corporate bonds with terms to maturity that closely match the estimated future cash outflows.\nIf we expect to pay short term cash bonuses, then a liability is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount (as a result of past service provided by the employee) and the obligation can be reliably measured.\n114\n114\n20181 $m\n4,225\n290\n243\n4,758\n468\n343\n811\n990\n675\n234\n1,899\n227\n248\n530\n223\n55\n650\n1,706\n9,401\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n3. OPERATING EXPENSES (continued)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nPersonnel expenses also include share-based payments which may be cash or equity settled. We calculate the fair value of equity settled remuneration at grant date, which is then amortised over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in share capital or the share option reserve as applicable. When we estimate the fair value, we take into account market vesting conditions, such as share price performance conditions. We take non-market vesting conditions, such as service conditions, into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the expense.\nAfter the grant of an equity-based award, the amount we recognise as an expense is reversed when non-market vesting conditions are not met, for example an employee fails to satisfy the minimum service period specified in the award on resignation, termination or notice of dismissal for serious misconduct. However, we do not reverse the expense if the award does not vest due to the failure to meet a market-based performance condition.\nFurther information on share-based payment schemes operated by the Group during the current and prior year is included in Note 31 Employee Share and Option Plans.\n115\n115\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n4.

INCOME TAX (continued)\nTAX CONSOLIDATION The Company and all its wholly owned Australian resident entities are part of a tax-consolidated group under Australian taxation law. The Company is the head entity in the tax-consolidated group. We recognise each of the following in the separate financial statements of members of the tax consolidated group on a ‘group allocation’ basis: tax expense/income, and deferred tax liabilities/assets, that arise from temporary differences of the members of the tax-consolidated group. The Company (as head entity in the tax-consolidated group) recognises current tax liabilities and assets of the tax-consolidated group.\nUnder a tax funding arrangement between the entities in the tax-consolidated group, amounts are recognised as payable to or receivable by the Company and each member of the tax-consolidated group in relation to the tax contribution amounts paid or payable between the Company and the other members of the tax-consolidated group.\nMembers of the tax-consolidated group have also entered into a tax sharing agreement that provides for the allocation of income tax liabilities between the entities were the head entity to default on its income tax payment obligations.\nUNRECOGNISED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nUnrecognised deferred tax assets related to unused realised tax losses (on revenue account) total $10 million (2018: $4 million). Unrecognised deferred tax liabilities related to additional potential foreign tax costs (assuming all retained earnings in offshore branches and subsidiaries are repatriated) total $429 million (2018: $390 million).\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nINCOME TAX EXPENSE\nCURRENT TAX EXPENSE\nDEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nJudgement is required in determining provisions held in respect of uncertain tax positions.

Eligible shareholders can elect to forgo their dividend entitlement and instead receive ANZ ordinary shares under the Company’s Bonus Option Plan (BOP). For the 2019 final dividend, DRP participation will be satisfied by an on-market purchase of shares and BOP participation will be satisfied by an issue of ANZ ordinary shares. There will be no discount applied to the DRP and BOP price.\nSee Note 22 Shareholders’ Equity for details of shares the Company issued or purchased in respect of the DRP and BOP.\nDIVIDEND FRANKING ACCOUNT\nCurrency\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\nAustralian franking credits available at 30% tax rate\nAUD\n35\n97\nNew Zealand imputation credits available (which can be attached to our Australian dividends but may only be used by New Zealand resident shareholders)\nNZD\n4,068\n3,868\nThe above amounts represent the balances of the franking accounts as at the end of the financial year, adjusted for:\nfranking credits that will arise from the payment of income tax payable as at the end of the financial year; and\nfranking credits/debits from the receipt/payment of dividends that have been recognised as tax receivables/payables as at the end of the financial year.\n118\n118\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n5. DIVIDENDS (continued)\nThe proposed final 2019 dividend will utilise the entire balance of $35 million franking credits available at 30 September 2019. Instalment tax payments on account of the 2020 financial year which will be made after 30 September 2019 will generate sufficient franking credits to enable the final 2019 dividend to be 70% franked. The extent to which future dividends will be franked will depend on a number of factors, including the level of profits generated by the Group that will be subject to tax in Australia.\nRESTRICTIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS APRA’s written approval is required before paying dividends on ANZ ordinary shares:\nif the aggregate dividends exceed the Company’s after tax earnings (in calculating those after tax earnings, we take into account any payments we made on senior capital instruments) in the financial year to which they relate; or\nif the Group’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio falls within capital range buffers specified by APRA.\nIf the Company fails to pay a dividend or distribution on its ANZ Capital Notes or ANZ Capital Securities on the scheduled payment date, it may (subject to a number of exceptions) be restricted from resolving to pay or paying any dividend on the ANZ ordinary shares.\n119\n119\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n6.

If the weighted average number of treasury shares held in Wealth Australia discontinued operations was included in the denominator used in calculating earnings per share from continuing operations, basic earnings per share from continuing operations for 2019 would have been 221.4 cents (2018: 244.4 cents) and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2019 would have been 212.4 cents (2018: 233.1 cents).\n2.

SEGMENT REPORTING\nDESCRIPTION OF SEGMENTS The Group’s five continuing operating segments are presented on a basis that is consistent with the information provided internally to the Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker. This reflects the way the Group’s businesses are managed, rather than the legal structure of the Group.\nWe measure the performance of these segments on a cash profit basis. To calculate cash profit, we remove certain non-core items from statutory profit. Details of these items are included in the “Other Items” section of this note. Transactions between business units across segments within ANZ are conducted on an arm’s-length basis and disclosed as part of the income and expenses of these segments.\nThe reportable segments are divisions engaged in providing either different products or services or similar products and services in different geographical areas. They are as follows:\nAustralia Retail and Commercial The Australia Retail and Commercial division comprises:\nRetail provides products and services to consumer customers in Australia via the branch network, mortgage specialists, contact centres, a variety of self-service channels (internet banking, phone banking, ATMs, website, ANZ share investing and digital banking) and third party brokers in addition to financial planning services provided by salaried financial planners.\nCommercial provides a full range of banking products and financial services including asset financing across the following customer segments: medium to large commercial customers and agribusiness customers across regional Australia, small business owners and high net worth individuals and family groups.\nInstitutional The Institutional division services governments, global institutional and corporate customers across three product sets: Transaction Banking, Loans & Specialised Finance and Markets.\nTransaction Banking provides working capital and liquidity solutions including documentary trade, supply chain financing, commodity financing as well as cash management solutions, deposits, payments and clearing.\nLoans & Specialised Finance provides loan products, loan syndication, specialised loan structuring and execution, project and export finance, debt structuring and acquisition finance and corporate advisory.\nMarkets provide risk management services on foreign exchange, interest rates, credit, commodities, debt capital markets in addition to managing the Group's interest rate exposure and liquidity position.\nNew Zealand The New Zealand division comprises:\nRetail provides a full range of banking and wealth management services to consumer, private banking and small business banking customers. We deliver our services via our internet and app-based digital solutions and network of branches, mortgage specialists, relationship managers and contact centres.\nCommercial provides a full range of banking services including traditional relationship banking and sophisticated financial solutions through dedicated managers focusing on privately owned medium to large enterprises, the agricultural business segment and governments.\nPacific The Pacific division provides products and services to retail customers, small to medium-sized enterprises, institutional customers and governments located in the Pacific Islands. Products and services include retail products provided to consumers, traditional relationship banking and sophisticated financial solutions provided to business customers through dedicated managers.\nTechnology, Services & Operations (TSO) and Group Centre TSO and Group Centre provide support to the operating divisions, including technology, group operations, shared services, property, risk management, financial management, strategy, marketing, human resources and corporate affairs. The Group Centre includes residual Asia Retail and Wealth, Group Treasury, Shareholder Functions and minority investments in Asia.\nRefer to Note 29 Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale for details on discontinued operations.\nOPERATING SEGMENTS The presentation of divisional results has been impacted by a number of methodology and structural changes during the period. Prior period comparatives have been restated as follows:\nThe methodology for allocating earnings on capital at a business unit level has changed from Economic Capital to Regulatory Capital. While neutral at a Group level, this change has impacted net interest income at the divisional level;\nThe residual Asia Retail and Wealth businesses have been transferred from the former Asia Retail and Pacific division to TSO and Group Centre division. The remaining segment has been renamed Pacific division; and\n121\n121\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n7. SEGMENT REPORTING (continued)\nOPERATING SEGMENTS (continued)\nANZ’s lenders mortgage insurance, share investing, general insurance distribution and financial planning businesses which were previously part of the continuing operations of Wealth Australia now form part of the Australia Retail and Commercial division (previously named Australia division) and Wealth Australia division ceases to exist as a continuing division.\nThe divisional results were also impacted by the adoption of two new accounting standards:\nAASB 9 - the Group implemented an expected credit loss methodology for impairment of financial assets, and revised the classification and measurement of certain financial assets from 1 October 2018. Consequently, the Group increased its provision for credit impairment by $813 million through opening retained earnings. Comparative information has not been restated.\nAASB 15 - the main impact of adoption is that certain items previously netted are now presented gross in operating income and operating expenses. Comparative information has been restated which increased total operating income by $153 million and is offset by an increase in total operating expenses of the same amount.\nYear ended 30 September 2019\nAustralia Retail and\nCommercial Institutional $m\n$m\nNew Zealand $m\nPacific $m\nTSO and Group Centre $m\nOther items1 $m\nGroup Total $m\nNet interest income Net fee and commission income\n8,092\n3,080\n2,736\n128\n303\n\n14,339\nLending fees - Non-lending fees - Commissions - Funds management income - Fee and commission expense Net income from insurance business Other income Share of associates’ profit Other operating income Operating income Operating expenses Profit before credit impairment and income tax Credit impairment (charge)/release Profit before income tax Income tax expense and non-controlling interests Profit after tax from continuing operations Profit/(Loss) after tax from discontinued operations Profit after tax attributable to shareholders Non-cash items Share of associates’ profit Depreciation and amortisation Equity-settled share based payment expenses Credit impairment (charge)/release\n290 1,499 75 14 (657) 100 27 (1) 1,347 9,439 (4,074) 5,365 (712) 4,653 (1,458) 3,195\n(1) (176) (13) (712)\n282 847 - 2 (338) - 1,399 - 2,192 5,272 (2,667) 2,605 2 2,607 (779) 1,828\n(112) (69) 2\n16 691 61 243 (459) 18 6 4 580 3,316 (1,286) 2,030 (87) 1,943 (544) 1,399\n4 (41) (4) (87)\n14 42 - - (9) - 57 - 104 232 (150) 82 1 83 (24) 59\n(7) (1) 1\n(20) (12) (5) 1 1 243 259 467 770 (894) (124) 1 (123) 112 (11) 259 (535) (33) 1\n- - - - 7 (251) - (244) (244) - (244) 1 (243) 69 (174)\n- - 1\n602 3,059 124 254 (1,462) 126 1,481 262 4,446 18,785 (9,071) 9,714 (794) 8,920 (2,624) 6,296 (343) 5,953\n262 (871) (120) (794)\nFinancial position Goodwill Investments in associates\nAustralia Retail and\nCommercial Institutional $m 1,070 2\n$m 410 17\nNew Zealand $m 1,937 -\nPacific $m 50 -\nTSO and Group Centre $m - 2,938\nDiscontinued operations $m 42 -\nGroup Total $m 3,509 2,957\n1.

Financial assets are classified into these measurement classifications on the basis of two criteria:\nthe business model within which the financial asset is managed; and\nthe contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset (specifically whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest).\nThe resultant financial asset classifications are as follows:\nAmortised cost: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest only and which are held in a business model whose objective is to collect their cash flows;\nFVOCI: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest only and which are held in a business model whose objective is to collect their cash flows or to sell the assets; and\nFVTPL: Any other financial assets not falling into the categories above are measured at FVTPL.\nFair value option for financial assets\nA financial asset may be irrevocably designated at FVTPL on initial recognition when the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\n8.

The seller has the corresponding obligation to fulfil the transaction to sell or buy the asset or instrument if the buyer exercises the option.\nRISKS MANAGED\nThe Group offers and uses the instruments described above to manage fluctuations in the following market factors:\nForeign Exchange\nCurrencies at current or determined rates of exchange.\nInterest Rate\nFixed or variable interest rates applying to money lent, deposited or borrowed.\nCommodity\nSoft commodities (that is, agricultural products such as wheat, coffee, cocoa and sugar) and hard commodities (that is, mined products such as gold, oil and gas).\nCredit\nCounterparty risk in the event of default.\n127\n127\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n10.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS – DESIGNATED IN HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS\nThere are three types of hedge accounting relationships the Group utilises:\nFair value hedge\nCash flow hedge\nObjective of this hedging arrangement\nTo hedge our exposure to changes to the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or unrecognised firm commitment caused by interest rate or foreign currency movements.\nTo hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, a firm commitment or a highly probable forecast transaction caused by interest rate, foreign currency and other price movements.\nRecognition of effective hedge portion\nThe following are recognised in profit or loss at the same time:\nall changes in the fair value of the underlying item relating to the hedged risk; and\nWe recognise the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge in the cash flow hedge reserve.\nthe change in the fair value of the derivatives.\nRecognition of ineffective hedge portion\nRecognised immediately in Other operating income.\nIf a hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated, or exercised; or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting\nWhen we recognise the hedged item in profit or loss, we recognise the related unamortised fair value adjustment in profit or loss. This may occur over time if the hedged item is amortised to profit or loss as part of the effective yield over the period to maturity.\nOnly when we recognise the hedged item in profit or loss is the amount previously deferred in the cash flow hedge reserve transferred to profit or loss.\nHedged item sold or repaid\nWe recognise the unamortised fair value adjustment immediately in profit or loss.\nAmounts accumulated in equity are transferred immediately to profit or loss.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNet investment hedge\nTo hedge our exposure to exchange rate differences arising from the translation of our foreign operations from their functional currency to Australian dollars.\nWe recognise the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument in the foreign currency translation reserve.\nThe amount we defer in the foreign currency translation reserve remains in equity and is transferred to profit or loss only when we dispose of, or partially dispose of, the foreign operation.\nThe gain or loss, or applicable proportion, we recognise in equity is transferred to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of a foreign operation.\n129\n129\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n10.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nRecognition\nInitially and at each reporting date, we recognise all derivatives at fair value. If the fair value of a derivative is positive, then we carry it as an asset, but if its value is negative, then we carry it as a liability.\nValuation adjustments are integral in determining the fair value of derivatives. This includes:\n\na credit valuation adjustment (CVA) to reflect the counterparty risk and/or event of default; and\n\na funding valuation adjustment (FVA) to account for funding costs and benefits in the derivatives portfolio.\nDerecognition of assets and liabilities\nWe remove derivative assets from our balance sheet when the contracts expire or we have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. We remove derivative liabilities from our balance sheet when the Group’s contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.\nImpact on the Income Statement\nHow we recognise gains or losses on derivative financial instruments depends on whether the derivative is held for trading or is designated into a hedging relationship. For derivative financial instruments held for trading, gains or losses from changes in the fair value are recognised in profit or loss.\nFor an instrument designated into a hedging relationship, the recognition of gains or losses depends on the nature of the item being hedged. Refer to the previous table on page 129 for profit or loss treatment depending on the hedge type.\nSources of hedge ineffectiveness may arise from basis risk and differences in discounting between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The hedging instruments are discounted using Overnight Index Swaps discount curves which are not applied to the hedged items.\nHedge effectiveness\nTo qualify for hedge accounting a hedge is expected to be highly effective. A hedge is highly effective only if the following conditions are met:\nthe hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the period for which the hedge is designated (prospective effectiveness); and\nthe actual results of the hedge are within the range of 80-125% (retrospective effectiveness).\nThe Group monitors hedge effectiveness on a regular basis but at a minimum at least at each reporting date.\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nJudgement is required when we select the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of derivatives, particularly the selection of valuation inputs that are not readily observable, and the application of valuation adjustments to certain derivatives. Refer to Note 17 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities for further details.\n133\n133\n●\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n11.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES (continued)\nDuring the year, the Group recognised a net gain (before tax) in other operating income from the recycling of gains/losses previously deferred in equity of $240 million (2018: $48 million) in respect of investment securities (applicable from 1 October 2018) and available-for-sale assets (prior to 1 October 2018).\nThe carrying value of equity securities at FVOCI / AFS equity securities is $1,221 million (2018: $1,095 million). This includes the Group’s $1,106 million (2018: $1,025 million) investment in the Bank of Tianjin (BoT).\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nPolicy applicable from 1 October 2018\nInvestment securities are those financial assets in security form (i.e. transferable debt or equity instruments) that are not held for trading purposes. By way of exception, bills of exchange (a form of security/transferable instrument) which are used to facilitate the Group’s customer lending activities are classified as Loans and advances (rather than Investment securities) to better reflect the substance of the arrangement.\nNon-traded equity investments may be designated at FVOCI on an instrument by instrument basis. If this election is made, gains or losses are not reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss on disposal of the investment. However, gains or losses may be reclassified within equity.\nAssets disclosed as Investment securities are subject to the general classification and measurement policy for Financial Assets outlined at the commencement of the Group’s financial asset disclosures on page 125. Additionally, expected credit losses associated with “Investment securities - debt securities at amortised cost” and “Investment securities - debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income” are recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting policy outlined in Note 13. For “Investment securities – debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income” the allowance for ECL is recognised in the FVOCI reserve in equity with a corresponding charge to profit or loss.\nPolicy applicable prior to 1 October 2018\nAFS assets comprise non-derivative financial assets which we designate as AFS since we do not hold them principally for trading purposes. They include both equity and debt securities. AFS assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and are revalued at least bi-annually. On revaluation, we include movements in fair value within the available-for-sale revaluation reserve in equity, except for certain items which are recognised directly in profit or loss, being interest on debt securities, dividends received, foreign exchange on debt securities and impairment charges.\nWhen we sell the asset, any cumulative gain or loss from the available-for-sale revaluation reserve is recognised in profit or loss.\nAt each reporting date, we assess whether any AFS assets are impaired. We assess the impairment of any debt securities if an event has occurred which will have a negative impact on the asset’s estimated cash flows. For equity securities, we assess if there is a significant or prolonged decline in their fair value below cost.\nIf an AFS asset is impaired, then we remove the cumulative loss related to that asset from the available-for-sale revaluation reserve. We then recognise it in profit or loss for:\ndebt instruments, as a credit impairment expense; and\nequity instruments, as a negative impact in other operating income.\nWe recognise any later reversals of impairment on debt securities in the profit or loss through the credit impairment charge line. However, we do not make any reversals of impairment for equity securities. To the extent previously impaired equity securities recover in value, gains are recognised directly in equity.\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nJudgement is required when we select valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of assets not valued using quoted market prices, particularly the selection of valuation inputs that are not readily observable. Refer to Note 17 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities for further details.\n135\n135\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n12.

On adoption of AASB 9 on 1 October 2018, the Group increased the collectively assessed provision by $647 million. Comparative information has not been restated. Refer to Note 35 for further details. 2. $500 million of collectively assessed provisions and $26 million of individually assessed provision for credit impairment attributable to off-balance sheet credit related commitments at 2018 were reclassified from Net loans and advances at amortised cost to Other provisions to enhance comparability with current period presentation.\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nLoans and advances are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and are facilities the Group provides directly to customers or through third party channels.\nLoans and advances are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the loan or advance, which are primarily brokerage/mortgage origination fees which we amortise over the estimated life of the loan. Subsequently, we then measure loans and advances at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, net of any provision for credit impairment, or at fair value when they are specifically designated on initial recognition as fair value through profit or loss or when held for trading.\nWe classify contracts to lease assets and hire purchase agreements as finance leases if they transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the customer or an unrelated third party. We include these facilities in ‘Other’ in the table above.\nThe Group enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets that are recognised on its balance sheet. When the Group retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets remain on the Group’s balance sheet, however if substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred, the Group derecognises the asset.\nIf the risks and rewards are partially retained and control over the asset is lost, the Group derecognises the asset. If control over the asset is not lost, the Group continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement.\nWe separately recognise the rights and obligations retained, or created, in the transfer of assets and liabilities as appropriate.\nFrom 1 October 2018, assets disclosed as net loans and advances are subject to the general classification and measurement policy for Financial Assets outlined at the commencement of the Group’s Financial Asset disclosures on page 125. Additionally, expected credit losses associated with loans and advances at amortised cost are recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting policy outlined in Note 13.\n136\n136\n2018 $m\n7,061 9,890 6,861 346,154 234,405 3,442 607,813 (430) 997 608,380 (2,917) 605,463 (999) 604,464\n126,811 477,653 604,464\n604,331 133 604,464\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n13.

ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nPolicy applicable from 1 October 2018\nEXPECTED CREDIT LOSS IMPAIRMENT MODEL\nThe measurement of expected credit losses reflects an unbiased, probability weighted prediction which evaluates a range of scenarios and takes into account the time value of money, past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.\nExpected credit losses are either measured over 12 months or the expected lifetime of the financial asset, depending on credit deterioration since origination, according to the following three-stage approach:\nStage 1: At the origination of a financial asset, and where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, an allowance equivalent to 12 months ECL is recognised reflecting the expected credit losses resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months from the reporting date. For instruments with a remaining maturity of less than 12 months, expected credit losses are estimated based on default events that are possible over the remaining time to maturity.\nStage 2: Where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised reflecting expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. If credit risk were to improve in a subsequent period such that the increase in credit risk since origination is no longer considered significant, the exposure returns to a Stage 1 classification and a 12 month ECL applies.\nStage 3: Where there is objective evidence of impairment, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised.\nExpected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for exposures in Stage 1 and Stage 2, and on either a collective or individual basis when transferred to Stage 3.\nMEASUREMENT OF EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS\nECL is calculated as the product of the following credit risk factors at a facility level, discounted to incorporate the time value of money:\nProbability of default (PD) - the estimate of the likelihood that a borrower will default over a given period;\nExposure at default (EAD) - the expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and interest, expected additional drawdowns and accrued interest; and\nLoss given default (LGD) - the expected loss in the event of the borrower defaulting, expressed as a percentage of the facility's EAD, taking into account direct and indirect recovery costs.\nThese credit risk factors are adjusted for current and forward looking information through the use of macro-economic variables.\nEXPECTED LIFE\nWhen estimating ECL for exposures in Stage 2 and 3, the Group considers the expected lifetime over which it is exposed to credit risk.\nFor non-retail portfolios, the Group uses the maximum contractual period as the expected lifetime for non-revolving credit facilities. For non-retail revolving credit facilities, such as corporate lines of credit, the expected life reflects the Group’s contractual right to withdraw a facility as part of a contractually agreed annual review, after taking into account the applicable notice period.\nFor retail portfolios, the expected lifetime is determined using behavioural term, taking into account expected prepayment behaviour and substantial modifications.\nDEFINITION OF DEFAULT, CREDIT IMPAIRED AND WRITE-OFFS\nThe definition of default used in measuring expected credit losses is aligned to the definition used for internal credit risk management purposes across all portfolios. This definition is also in line with the regulatory definition of default. Default occurs when there are indicators that a debtor is unlikely to fully satisfy contractual credit obligations to the Group, or the exposure is 90 days past due.\nFinancial assets, including those that are well secured, are considered credit impaired for financial reporting purposes when they default.\nWhen there is no realistic probability of recovery, loans are written off against the related impairment allowance on completion of the Group’s internal processes and when all reasonably expected recoveries have been collected. In subsequent periods, any recoveries of amounts previously written-off are credited to credit impairment charge in the income statement.\n140\n140\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n13. ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nMODIFIED FINANCIAL ASSETS\nIf the terms of a financial asset are modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one for either credit or commercial reasons, an assessment is made to determine if the changes to the terms of the existing financial asset are considered substantial. This assessment considers both changes in cash flows arising from the modified terms as well as changes in the overall instrument risk profile; for example, changes in the principal (credit limit), term, or type of underlying collateral. Where a modification is considered non-substantial, the existing financial asset is not derecognised and its date of origination continues to be used to determine SICR. Where a modification is considered substantial, the existing financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at its fair value on the modification date, which also becomes the date of origination used to determine SICR for this new asset.\nSIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CREDIT RISK (SICR)\nStage 2 assets are those that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination. In determining what constitutes a SICR, the Group considers both qualitative and quantitative information: i.\nInternal credit rating grade\nFor the majority of portfolios, the primary indicator of a SICR is a significant deterioration in the internal credit rating grade of a facility since origination and is measured by application of thresholds.\nFor non-retail portfolios, a SICR is determined by comparing the Customer Credit Rating (CCR) applicable to a facility at reporting date to the CCR at origination of that facility. A CCR is assigned to each borrower which reflects the probability of default of the borrower and incorporates both borrower and non-borrower specific information, including forward looking information. CCRs are subject to review at least annually or more frequently when an event occurs which could affect the credit risk of the customer.\nFor retail portfolios, a SICR is determined by comparing each facility’s scenario weighted lifetime probability of default at the reporting date to the scenario weighted lifetime probability of default at origination. The scenario weighted lifetime probability of default may increase significantly if:\nthere has been a deterioration in the economic outlook, or an increase in economic uncertainty; or\nthere has been a deterioration in the customer’s overall credit position, or ability to manage their credit obligations.\nii. Backstop criteria\nThe Group uses 30 days past due arrears as a backstop criteria for both non-retail and retail portfolios. For retail portfolios only, facilities are required to demonstrate three to six months of good payment behaviour prior to being allocated back to Stage 1.\nFORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION\nForward-looking information is incorporated into both our assessment of whether a financial asset has experienced a significant increase in credit risk since its initial recognition and in our estimate of ECL. In applying forward looking information for estimating ECL, the Group considers four probability-weighted forecast economic scenarios as follows:\ni.\nBase case scenario\nThe base case scenario is ANZ’s view of the most likely future macro-economic conditions. It reflects management’s assumptions used for strategic planning and budgeting, and also informs the Group Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) which is the process the Group applies in strategic and capital planning over a 3 year time horizon;\nii. Upside and iii. Downside scenarios\nThe upside and downside scenarios are fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions (that is, they are not based on the economic conditions prevailing at balance date) and are based on a combination of more optimistic (in the case of the upside) and pessimistic (in the case of the downside) economic events and uncertainty over long term horizons; and\niv. Severe downside scenario\nThe severe downside scenario is fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions and accounts for the potentially severe impact of less likely extremely adverse economic conditions. It reflects macro-economic conditions of a downturn economic event with a probability of occurrence once every 25 years.\nThe four scenarios are described in terms of macro-economic variables used in the PD, LGD and EAD models (collectively the ECL models) depending on the portfolio and country of the borrower. Examples of the variables include unemployment rates, GDP growth rates, house price indices, commercial property price indices and consumer price indices.\n141\n141\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n13. ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nProbability weighting of each scenario is determined by management considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the base case scenario, as well as specific portfolio considerations where required. The Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO) is responsible for reviewing and approving the base case forecast scenario and the Credit and Market Risk Committee (CMRC) approves the probability weights applied to each scenario.\nWhere applicable, temporary adjustments may be made to account for situations where known or expected risks have not been adequately addressed in the modelling process. CMRC is responsible for approving such adjustments.\nECL Sensitivity\nThe table below illustrates the impact on the Group’s ECL allowance under scenarios where a 100% weighting is applied to both upside and downside scenarios with all other modelling assumptions remaining constant.\nTotal ECL $m\nImpact $m\n100% upside scenario\n2,384\n(993)\n100% downside scenario\n5,334\n1,956\nPolicy applicable prior to 1 October 2018\nThe Group recognises two types of impairment provisions for its loans and advances:\nIndividual provisions for significant assets that are assessed to be impaired; and  Collective provisions for portfolios of similar assets that are assessed collectively for impairment.\nThe accounting treatment for each of them is detailed below:\nIndividually\nCollectively\nAssessment\nIf any impaired loans and advances exceed specified thresholds and an impairment event has been identified, then we assess the need for a provision individually.\nTo allow for any small value loans and advances where losses may have been incurred but not yet identified, and individually significant loans and advances that we do not assess as impaired, we assess them collectively in pools of assets with similar credit risk characteristics.\nImpairment\nLoans and advances are assessed as impaired if we have objective evidence that we may not recover principal or interest payments (that is, a loss event has been incurred).\nWe estimate the provision on the basis of historical loss experience for assets with similar credit risk characteristics to others in the respective collective pool. We adjust the historical loss experience based on current observable data – such as: changing economic conditions, the impact of the inherent risk of large concentrated losses within the portfolio and an assessment of the economic cycle.\nMeasurement\nWe measure impairment loss as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and estimated future cash flows discounted to their present value at the asset’s original effective interest rate. We record the result as an expense in profit or loss in the period we identify the impairment and recognise a corresponding reduction in the carrying amount of loans and advances through an offsetting provision.\nUncollectable amounts\nIf a loan or advance is uncollectable (whether partially or in full), then we write off the balance (and also any related provision for credit impairment). We write off unsecured retail facilities at the earlier of the facility becoming 180 days past due, or the customer’s bankruptcy or similar legal release from the obligation to repay the loan or advance. For secured facilities, write offs occur net of the proceeds determined to be recoverable from the realisation of collateral.\nRecoveries\nIf we recover any cash flows from loans and advances we have previously written off, then we recognise the recovery in profit or loss in the period the cash flows are received.\nOff-balance sheet amounts\nAny off-balance sheet items, such as loan commitments, are considered for impairment both on an individual and collective basis.\n142\n142\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n13. ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nApplicable from 1 October 2018\nWhen estimating the allowance for expected credit losses for loans and advances, we used management’s judgement in respect of the\nmatters outlined below.\nKey Judgements\nDetermining when a significant increase in credit risk has occurred\nIn the measurement of ECL, judgement is involved in setting the rules to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition of a loan, resulting in the financial asset moving from ‘stage 1’ to ‘stage 2’. This is a key area of judgement as transition from stage 1 to stage 2 increases the ECL calculation from an allowance based on the probability of default in the next 12 months, to an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses. Subsequent decreases in credit risk combined with transition from stage 2 to stage 1 may similarly result in significant changes in the ECL allowance.\nMeasuring both 12-month and lifetime credit losses\nThe setting of precise trigger points requires judgement which may have a material impact upon the size of the ECL allowance. The Group monitors the effectiveness of SICR criteria on an ongoing basis. The PD, LGD, and EAD credit risk parameters used in determining ECL are point-in-time measures reflecting the relevant forward looking information determined by management. Judgement is involved in determining which forward-looking information variables are relevant for particular lending portfolios and for determining each portfolio’s point-in-time sensitivity.\nIn addition, judgement is required where behavioural characteristics are applied in estimating the lifetime of a facility to be used in measuring ECL. All other things being equal, an increase in the expected behavioural life will increase the amount of ECL.\nForecasting forward-looking scenarios\nOur forecast of forward looking information variables is established from a “base case” or most likely scenario that is used internally by management for planning and forecasting purposes.\nThe expected outcomes of key economic drivers for the base case scenario as at 30 September 2019 are as follows:\nAustralia The unemployment rate is expected to remain essentially flat and GDP growth to improve modestly over the forecast period, with residential property values expected to improve after a period of decline. Commercial property prices are expected to decline slightly through the forecast period. Consumer price index growth is expected to rise from current levels. New Zealand GDP growth is forecast to improve modestly over the forecast period, with the unemployment rate remaining stable. Residential property values are expected to achieve modest levels of growth. Commercial property prices are expected to grow, however, the growth rate is expected to be modest through the forecast period. The consumer price index is expected to rise modestly. Rest of world GDP growth is forecast to taper lower in the near term due to uncertainty in the global outlook. Inflation is also expected to remain soft over the forecast period to 2020.\nProbability weighting of each scenario\nProbability weighting of each scenario is determined by management considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the base case scenario, as well as specific portfolio considerations where required.\nManagement temporary adjustments\nManagement temporary adjustments to the ECL allowance are adjustments we use in circumstances where we judge that our existing inputs, assumptions and model techniques do not capture all the risk factors relevant to our lending portfolios. Emerging local or global macroeconomic, microeconomic or political events, and natural disasters that are not incorporated into our current parameters, risk ratings, or forward-looking information are examples of such circumstances.\nThe use of management temporary adjustments may impact the amount of ECL recognised.\n143\n143\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n13.

Additionally, financial liabilities can be designated at FVTPL where:\nthe designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch which would otherwise arise;\na group of financial liabilities are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management strategy; or\nthe financial liability contains one or more embedded derivatives unless:\na) the embedded derivative does not significantly modify the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract, or\nb) the embedded derivative is closely related to the host financial liability.\nWhere financial liabilities are designated as measured at fair value, gains or losses relating to changes in the entity’s own credit risk are included in other comprehensive income, except where doing so would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. This section of AASB 9 was early adopted by the Group on 1 October 2013.\n144\n144\n●\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n14.

Where the Group enters into a fair value hedge accounting relationship, the fair value attributable to the hedge risk is reflected in adjustments to the carrying value of the debt. Interest expense is recognised using the effective interest rate method.\nSubordinated debt with capital-based conversion features (i.e. Common Equity Capital Trigger Events or Non-Viability Trigger Events) are considered to contain embedded derivatives that we account for separately at fair value through profit and loss. The embedded derivatives arise because the amount of shares issued on conversion following any of those trigger events is subject to the maximum conversion number, however they have no significant value as of the reporting date given the remote nature of those trigger events.\n150\n150\n2018 $m\n416\n1,249\n1,665\n750\n1,091\n503\n507\n199\n243\n698\n1,869\n121\n120\n\n225\n6,326\n7,991\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n16. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nRISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND MODEL\nINTRODUCTION\nThe use of financial instruments is fundamental to the Group’s businesses of providing banking and other financial services to our customers. The associated financial risks (primarily credit, market, and liquidity risks) are a significant portion of the Group’s key material risks.\nWe disclose details of all key material risks impacting the Group, and further information on the Group’s risk management activities, in the Governance and Risk Management section.\nThis note details the Group’s financial risk management policies, processes and quantitative disclosures in relation to the key financial risks.\nKey material financial risks\nKey sections applicable to this risk\nOverview\nAn overview of our Risk Management Framework\nCredit risk The risk of financial loss resulting from:\nCredit risk overview, management and control responsibilities\nMaximum exposure to credit risk\na counterparty failing to fulfil its obligations; or\nCredit quality\na decrease in credit quality of a counterparty resulting in a financial loss.\nConcentrations of credit risk\nCollateral management\nCredit Risk incorporates the risks associated with us lending to customers who could be impacted by climate change or by changes to laws, regulations, or other policies adopted by governments or regulatory authorities, including carbon pricing and climate change adaptation or mitigation policies.\nMarket risk The risk to the Group’s earnings arising from:\nMarket risk overview, management and control responsibilities\nMeasurement of market risk\nchanges in any interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, volatility and correlations; or\nfrom fluctuations in bond, commodity or equity prices.\n\n\nTraded and non-traded market risk\nEquity securities designated at FVOCI (from 1 October 2018) and available-for-sale (prior to 1 October 2018)\n\nForeign currency risk – structural exposure\nLiquidity and funding risk The risk that the Group is unable to meet payment obligations as they fall due, including:\n\nLiquidity risk overview, management and control responsibilities\nKey areas of measurement for liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk outcomes\nrepaying depositors or maturing wholesale debt; or\nResidual contractual maturity analysis of the Group’s liabilities\nthe Group having insufficient capacity to fund increases in assets.\nLife insurance risk Insurance risk is the risk of loss due to unexpected changes in current and future insurance claims rates. The changes primarily arise due to claims payments, mortality (death) or morbidity (illness or injury) rates being greater than expected.\nWe control and minimise life insurance risk in the following ways:\nWe use underwriting procedures including strategic decisions, limits to delegated authorities and signing powers.\nWe analyse reinsurance arrangements using analytical modelling tools to achieve the desired type of reinsurance and retention levels. No further detail is provided in this section.\n151\n151\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n16. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\nOVERVIEW\nAN OVERVIEW OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK This overview is provided to aid the users of the financial statements to understand the context of the financial disclosures required under AASB 7. It should be read in conjunction with the Governance and Risk Management section.\nThe Board is responsible for establishing and overseeing the Group’s Risk Management Framework (RMF). The Board has delegated authority to the Board Risk Committee (BRC) to develop and monitor compliance with the Group’s risk management policies. The BRC reports regularly to the Board on its activities.\nThe Board approves the strategic objectives of the Group including:\nthe Risk Appetite Statement (RAS), which sets out the Board’s expectations regarding the degree of risk that ANZ is prepared to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives and business plan; and\nthe Risk Management Strategy (RMS), which describes ANZ’s strategy for managing risks and the key elements of the RMF that gives effect to this strategy. This includes a description of each material risk, and an overview of how the RMF addresses each risk, with reference to the relevant policies, standards and procedures. It also includes information on how ANZ identifies measures, evaluates, monitors, reports and controls or mitigates material risks.\nThe Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and robust control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. At ANZ, risk is everyone’s responsibility.\nThe Group has an independent risk management function, headed by the Chief Risk Officer who:\nis responsible for overseeing the risk profile and the risk management framework;\ncan effectively challenge activities and decisions that materially affect ANZ’s risk profile; and\nhas an independent reporting line to the BRC to enable the appropriate escalation of issues of concern.\nThe Internal Audit Function reports directly to the Board Audit Committee (BAC). Internal Audit provides:\nan independent evaluation of the Group’s RMF annually that seeks to ensure compliance with, and the effectiveness of, the risk management framework;\nfacilitation of a comprehensive review every three years that seeks to ensure that the appropriateness, effectiveness and adequacy of the risk management framework; and\nrecommendations to improve the framework and/or work practices to strengthen the effectiveness of day to day operations.\n152\n152\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n16. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\nCREDIT RISK\nCREDIT RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES Granting credit facilities to customers is one of the Group’s major sources of income. As this activity is also a principal risk, the Group dedicates considerable resources to its management. The Group assumes credit risk in a wide range of lending and other activities in diverse markets and in many jurisdictions. Credit risks arise from traditional lending to customers as well as from interbank, treasury, trade finance and capital markets activities around the world.\nOur credit risk management framework ensures we apply a consistent approach across the Group when we measure, monitor and manage the credit risk appetite set by the Board. The Board is assisted and advised by the BRC in discharging its duty to oversee credit risk. The BRC:\nsets the credit risk appetite and credit strategies; and\napproves credit transactions beyond the discretion of executive management.\nWe quantify credit risk through an internal credit rating system (masterscales) to ensure consistency across exposure types and to provide a consistent framework for reporting and analysis. The system uses models and other tools to measure the following for customer exposures:\nProbability of Default (PD)\nExpressed by a Customer Credit Rating (CCR), reflecting the Group’s assessment of a customer’s ability to service and repay debt.\nExposure at Default (EAD)\nThe expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and interest, expected additional draw downs and accrued interest at the time of default.\nLoss Given Default (LGD)\nExpressed by a Security Indicator (SI) ranging from A to G. The SI is calculated by reference to the percentage of loan covered by security which the Group can realise if a customer defaults. The A-G scale is supplemented by a range of other SIs which cover factors such as cash cover and sovereign backing. For retail and some small business lending, we group exposures into large homogenous pools – and the LGD is assigned at the pool level.\nOur specialist credit risk teams develop and validate the Group’s PD and LGD rating models. The outputs from these models drive our day-to-day credit risk management decisions including origination, pricing, approval levels, regulatory capital adequacy, economic capital allocation, and credit provisioning.\nAll customers with whom ANZ has a credit relationship are assigned a CCR at origination via either of the following assessment approaches:\nLarge and more complex lending\nRetail and some small business lending\nRating models provide a consistent and structured assessment, with judgement required around the use of out-of-model factors. We handle credit approval on a dual approval basis, jointly with the business writer and an independent credit officer.\nAutomated assessment of credit applications using a combination of scoring (application and behavioural), policy rules and external credit reporting information. If the application does not meet the automated assessment criteria, then it is referred out for manual assessment.\nWe use the Group’s internal CCRs to manage the credit quality of financial assets. To enable wider comparisons, the Group’s CCRs are mapped to external rating agency scales as follows:\nCredit Quality Description\nInternal CCR\nANZ Customer Requirements\nMoody’s Rating\nStandard & Poors Rating\nStrong\nCCR 0+ to 4-\nDemonstrated superior stability in their operating and financial performance over the long-term, and whose earnings capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.\nAaa – Baa3\nAAA – BBB-\nSatisfactory\nCCR 5+ to 6-\nDemonstrated sound operational and financial stability over the medium to long-term, even though some may be susceptible to cyclical trends or variability in earnings.\nBa1 – B1\nBB+ – B+\nWeak\nCCR 7+ to 8=\nDemonstrated some operational and financial instability, with variability and uncertainty in profitability and liquidity projected to continue over the short and possibly medium term.\nB2 - Caa\nB - CCC\nDefaulted\nCCR 8- to 10\nWhen doubt arises as to the collectability of a credit facility, the financial instrument (or “the facility”) is classified as defaulted.\nN/A\nN/A\n153\n153\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n16. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\nCREDIT RISK (continued)\nThe Group has adopted AASB 9 effective from 1 October 2018 which has resulted in changes to the classification and measurement of financial assets, including the impairment of financial assets. The presentation of credit risk information for 2019 has been amended. Refer to Note 1 and 35 for further details on key requirements and impacts of the changes due to the adoption of AASB 9.\nMAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK For financial assets recognised on the balance sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount. In certain circumstances there may be differences between the carrying amounts reported on the balance sheet and the amounts reported in the tables below. Principally, these differences arise in respect of financial assets that are subject to risks other than credit risk, such as equity instruments which are primarily subject to market risk, or bank notes and coins.\nFor undrawn facilities, this maximum exposure to credit risk is the full amount of the committed facilities. For contingent exposures, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount the Group would have to pay if the instrument is called upon.\nFor the purpose of this note, assets presented as assets held for sale in the Balance Sheet have been reallocated to their respective Balance Sheet categories.\nThe table below shows our maximum exposure to credit risk of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions before taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements.\nReported\nExcluded1\nMaximum exposure to credit risk\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\nOn-balance sheet positions\nNet loans and advances\n615,258\n605,463\n\n\n615,258\n605,463\nOther financial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n81,621\n84,964\n1,186\n1,466\n80,435\n83,498\nSettlement balances owed to ANZ\n3,739\n2,319\n3,739\n2,319\n\n\nCollateral paid\n15,006\n11,043\n\n\n15,006\n11,043\nTrading securities\n44,088\n37,722\n6,199\n3,595\n37,889\n34,127\nDerivative financial instruments\n120,667\n68,426\n\n\n120,667\n68,426\nInvestment securities2\ndebt securities at amortised costs\n5,999\n\n\n\n5,999\n\ndebt securities at FVOCI\n76,489\n\n\n\n76,489\n\nequity securities at FVOCI\n1,221\n\n1,221\n\n\n\nAvailable-for-sale assets2\n\n75,363\n\n1,095\n\n74,268\nRegulatory deposits\n879\n1,028\n\n\n879\n1,028\nInvestments backing policy liabilities\n\n40,054\n\n40,054\n\n\nOther financial assets3\n3,619\n3,850\n\n\n3,619\n3,850\nTotal other financial assets\n353,328\n324,769\n12,345\n48,529\n340,983\n276,240\nSubtotal\n968,586\n930,232\n12,345\n48,529\n956,241\n881,703\nOff-balance sheet positions\nUndrawn and contingent facilities4\n253,123\n244,582\n\n\n253,123\n244,582\nTotal\n1,221,709\n1,174,814\n12,345\n48,529\n1,209,364\n1,126,285\n1.

On adoption of AASB 9 on 1 October 2018, the classification and measurement of financial assets were revised. Available-for-sale classification used in comparative periods ceases to exist under AASB 9 and a new classification of investment securities was introduced. Refer to Note 1 for further details.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\nCREDIT RISK (continued)\nCOLLATERAL MANAGEMENT\nWe use collateral for on and off-balance sheet exposures to mitigate credit risk if a counterparty cannot meet its repayment obligations. Where there is sufficient collateral, an expected credit loss is not recognised. This is largely the case for certain lending products that are secured by corresponding investment for which the margin loans are utilised and for reverse repurchase agreements. For some products, the collateral provided by customers is fundamental to the product’s structuring, so it is not strictly the secondary source of repayment - for example, lending secured by trade receivables is typically repaid by the collection of those receivables. During the period there was no change in our collateral policies.\nThe nature of collateral or security held for the relevant classes of financial assets is as follows:\nNet loans and advances\nLoans - housing and personal\nHousing loans are secured by mortgage(s) over property and additional security may take the form of guarantees and deposits.\nPersonal lending (including credit cards and overdrafts) is predominantly unsecured. If we take security, then it is restricted to eligible vehicles, motor homes and other assets.\nLoans - business\nBusiness loans may be secured, partially secured or unsecured. Typically, we take security by way of a mortgage over property and/or a charge over the business or other assets.\nIf appropriate, we may take other security to mitigate the credit risk, for example: guarantees, standby letters of credit or derivative protection.\nOther financial assets\nTrading securities, Investment securities (from 1 October 2018), Available- for-sale assets (prior to 1 October 2018), Derivatives and Other financial assets\nFor trading securities, we do not seek collateral directly from the issuer or counterparty. However, the collateral may be implicit in the terms of the instrument (for example, with an asset-backed security). The terms of debt securities may include collateralisation.\nFor derivatives, we typically terminate all contracts with the counterparty and settle on a net basis at market levels current at the time of a counterparty default under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreements.\nOur preferred practice is to use a Credit Support Annex (CSA) to the ISDA so that open derivative positions with the counterparty are aggregated and cash collateral (or other forms of eligible collateral) is exchanged daily. The collateral is provided by the counterparty when their position is out of the money (or provided to the counterparty by ANZ when our position is out of the money).\nOff-balance sheet positions\nUndrawn and contingent facilities\nCollateral for off balance sheet positions is mainly held against undrawn facilities, and they are typically performance bonds or guarantees. Undrawn facilities that are secured include housing loans secured by mortgages over residential property and business lending secured by commercial real estate and/or charges over business assets.\nThe table below shows the estimated value of collateral we hold and the net unsecured portion of credit exposures:\nCredit exposure\nTotal value of collateral\nUnsecured portion of credit exposure\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\nNet loans and advances\n615,258\n605,463\n490,188\n482,097\n125,070\n123,366\nOther financial assets\n340,983\n276,240\n31,898\n33,215\n309,085\n243,025\nOff-balance sheet positions\n253,123\n244,582\n48,225\n49,141\n204,898\n195,441\nTotal\n1,209,364\n1,126,285\n570,311\n564,453\n639,053\n561,832\n159\n159\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n16. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\nMARKET RISK\nMARKET RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES Market risk stems from the Group’s trading and balance sheet management activities and the impact of changes and correlation between interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads and volatility in bond, commodity or equity prices.\nThe BRC delegates responsibility for day-to-day management of both market risks and compliance with market risk policies to the Credit & Market Risk Committee (CMRC) and the Group Asset & Liability Committee (GALCO).\nWithin overall strategies and policies established by the BRC, business units and risk management have joint responsibility for the control of market risk at the Group level. The Market Risk team (a specialist risk management unit independent of the business) allocates market risk limits at various levels and monitors and reports on them daily. This detailed framework allocates individual limits to manage and control exposures using risk factors and profit and loss limits.\nManagement, measurement and reporting of market risk is undertaken in two broad categories:\nTraded Market Risk\nNon-Traded Market Risk\nRisk of loss from changes in the value of financial instruments due to movements in price factors for both physical and derivative trading positions. Principal risk categories monitored are:\n1. Currency risk – potential loss arising from changes in foreign exchange rates or their implied volatilities.\n2. Interest rate risk – potential loss from changes in market interest rates or their implied volatilities.\nRisk of loss associated with the management of non-traded interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange exposures. This includes interest rate risk in the banking book. This risk of loss arises from adverse changes in the overall and relative level of interest rates for different tenors, differences in the actual versus expected net interest margin, and the potential valuation risk associated with embedded options in financial instruments and bank products.\n3. Credit spread risk – potential loss arising from a movement in margin or spread relative to a benchmark.\n4. Commodity risk – potential loss arising from changes in commodity prices or their implied volatilities.\n5. Equity risk – potential loss arising from changes in equity prices.\nMEASUREMENT OF MARKET RISK We primarily manage and control market risk using Value at Risk (VaR), sensitivity analysis and stress testing.\nVaR gauges the Group’s possible daily loss based on historical market movements.\nThe Group’s VaR approach for both traded and non-traded risk is historical simulation. We use historical changes in market rates, prices and volatilities over:\nthe previous 500 business days, to calculate standard VaR, and  a 1-year stressed period, to calculate stressed VaR.\nWe calculate traded and non-traded VaR using one-day and ten-day holding periods. For stressed VaR, we use a ten-day period. Back testing is used to ensure our VaR models remain accurate.\nANZ measures VaR at a 99% confidence interval which means there is a 99% chance that a loss will not exceed the VaR for the relevant holding period.\n160\n160\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n16.

The diversification benefit reflects risks that offset across categories. The high and low VaR figures reported for each factor did not necessarily occur on the same day as the high and low VaR reported for the Group as a whole. Consequently, a diversification benefit for high and low would not be meaningful and is therefore omitted from the table.\nNon-traded market risk\nBalance sheet risk management The principal objectives of balance sheet risk management are to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk to mitigate the negative impact of movements in interest rates on the earnings and market value of the Group’s banking book, while ensuring the Group maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations as they fall due.\nInterest rate risk management Non-traded interest rate risk relates to the potential adverse impact of changes in market interest rates on the Group’s future net interest income. This risk arises from two principal sources, namely mismatches between the repricing dates of interest bearing assets and liabilities; and the investment of capital and other non-interest bearing liabilities in interest bearing assets. Interest rate risk is reported using VaR and scenario analysis (based on the impact of a 1% rate shock). The table below shows VaR figures for non-traded interest rate risk for the combined Group as well as Australia, New Zealand and Asia Pacific, Europe and Americas (APEA) geographies which are calculated separately.\n2019\n2018\nAs at $m\nHigh for year $m\nLow for year $m\nAverage for year $m\nAs at $m\nHigh for year $m\nLow for year $m\nAverage for year $m\nNon-traded value at risk 99% confidence\nAustralia\n22.7\n22.7\n16.4\n18.9\n21.9\n32.7\n20.3\n23.6\nNew Zealand\n9.6\n9.6\n7.1\n8.0\n6.8\n7.1\n5.6\n6.6\nAsia Pacific, Europe & America\n17.6\n17.7\n12.9\n16.1\n15.1\n15.1\n12.5\n13.7\nDiversification benefit1\n(17.8)\nn/a\nn/a\n(14.8)\n(16.1)\nn/a\nn/a\n(14.4)\nTotal VaR\n32.1\n32.1\n25.2\n28.2\n27.7\n36.4\n26.0\n29.5\n1.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\nMARKET RISK (continued)\nWe undertake scenario analysis to stress test the impact of extreme events on the Group’s market risk exposures. We model a 1% overnight parallel positive shift in the yield curve to determine the potential impact on our net interest income over the next 12 months. This is a standard risk measure which assumes the parallel shift is reflected in all wholesale and customer rates.\nThe table below shows the outcome of this risk measure for the current and previous financial years, expressed as a percentage of reported net interest income. A positive number signifies that a rate increase is positive for net interest income over the next 12 months.\n2019\nImpact of 1% rate shock\nAs at period end\n1.19%\nMaximum exposure\n1.19%\nMinimum exposure\n0.33%\nAverage exposure (in absolute terms)\n0.69%\n1. Prior period numbers have been restated to reflect IRR model enhancements\nEQUITY SECURITIES DESIGNATED AT FVOCI (FROM 1 OCTOBER 2018) AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE (PRIOR TO 1 OCTOBER 2018) Our investment securities (from 1 October 2018) and available-for-sale financial assets (prior to 1 October 2018) contain equity investment holdings which predominantly comprise investments we hold for longer-term strategic reasons. The market risk impact on these equity investments is not captured by the Group’s VaR processes for traded and non-traded market risks. Therefore, the Group regularly reviews the valuations of the investments within the portfolio and assesses whether the investments are appropriately measured based on the recognition and measurement policies set out in Note 11 Investment securities.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RISK – STRUCTURAL EXPOSURES Our investment of capital in foreign operations - for example, branches, subsidiaries or associates with functional currencies other than the Australian Dollar - exposes the Group to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates. Variations in the value of these foreign operations arising as a result of exchange differences are reflected in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity.\nWhere it is considered appropriate, the Group takes out economic hedges against larger foreign exchange denominated revenue streams (primarily New Zealand Dollar, US Dollar and US Dollar correlated). The primary objective of hedging is to ensure that, if practical, the consolidated capital ratios are neutral to the effect of changes in exchange rates.\n162\n162\n20181\n1.21%\n1.79%\n0.77%\n1.11%\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n16. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\nLIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISK\nLIQUIDITY RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is either:\nunable to meet its payment obligations (including repaying depositors or maturing wholesale debt) when they fall due; or  does not have the appropriate amount, tenor and composition of funding and liquidity to fund increases in its assets.\nManagement of liquidity and funding risks are overseen by GALCO. The Group’s liquidity and funding risks are governed by a set of principles approved by the BRC and include:\nmaintaining the ability to meet all payment obligations in the immediate term;  ensuring that the Group has the ability to meet ‘survival horizons’ under a range of ANZ specific, and general market, liquidity stress scenarios, at the site and Group-wide level, to meet cash flow obligations over the short to medium term;\nmaintaining strength in the Group’s balance sheet structure to ensure long term resilience in the liquidity and funding risk profile;  ensuring the liquidity management framework is compatible with local regulatory requirements;  preparing daily liquidity reports and scenario analysis to quantify the Group’s positions;  targeting a diversified funding base to avoid undue concentrations by investor type, maturity, market source and currency;  holding a portfolio of high quality liquid assets to protect against adverse funding conditions and to support day-to-day operations; and  establishing detailed contingency plans to cover different liquidity crisis events.\nKEY AREAS OF MEASUREMENT FOR LIQUIDITY RISK\nScenario modelling of funding sources ANZ’s liquidity risk appetite is defined by a range of regulatory and internal liquidity metrics mandated by the Board. The metrics cover a range of scenarios of varying duration and level of severity.\nA key component of this framework is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which is a severe short term liquidity stress scenario mandated by banking regulators including APRA. As part of meeting LCR requirements, the Group has a Committed Liquidity Facility (CLF) with the Reserve Bank of Australia. The CLF has been established to offset the shortage of available High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) in Australia and provides an alternative form of contingent liquidity. The total amount of the CLF available to a qualifying Australian Deposit-taking Institution is set annually by APRA. From 1 January 2019, ANZ’s CLF is $48.0 billion (2018 calendar year end: $46.9 billion).\nLiquid assets The Group holds a portfolio of high quality (unencumbered) liquid assets to protect the Group’s liquidity position in a severely stressed environment, to meet regulatory requirements. HQLA comprise three categories consistent with Basel III LCR requirements:\nHQLA1- Cash and highest credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities eligible for repurchase with central banks to provide same-day liquidity.\nHQLA2 - High credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities, high quality corporate debt securities and high quality covered bonds eligible for repurchase with central banks to provide same-day liquidity.\nAlternative liquid assets (ALA) - Assets qualifying as collateral for the CLF and eligible securities that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will accept in its domestic market operations.\nLIQUIDITY RISK OUTCOMES1\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio ANZ’s Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) averaged 140% for 2019, an increase from the 2018 average of 138%, and above the regulatory minimum of 100%.\nNet Stable Funding Ratio ANZ’s Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) as at 30 September 2019 was 116% (2018: 115%), above the regulatory minimum of 100%.\n1. This information is not within the scope of the external audit of the Group Financial Report by the Group’s external auditor, KPMG.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\nLIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISK (continued)\nLiquidity crisis contingency planning The Group maintains APRA-endorsed liquidity crisis contingency plans for analysing and responding to a liquidity threatening event at a country and Group-wide level. Key liquidity contingency crisis planning requirements and guidelines include:\nOngoing business management\nEarly signs/ mild stress\nSevere Stress\nEstablish crisis/severity levels\nMonitoring and review\nActivate contingency funding plans\nLiquidity limits\nManagement actions not requiring\nManagement actions for altering asset and liability\nEarly warning indicators\nbusiness rationalisation\nbehaviour\nAssigned responsibility for internal and external communications and the appropriate timing to communicate\nSince the precise nature of any stress event cannot be known in advance, we design the plans to be flexible to the nature and severity of the stress event with multiple variables able to be accommodated in any plan.\nGroup funding The Group monitors the composition and stability of its funding so that it remains within the Group’s funding risk appetite. This approach ensures that an appropriate proportion of the Group’s assets are funded by stable funding sources, including customer deposits; longer-dated wholesale funding (with a remaining term exceeding one year); and equity.\nFunding plans prepared\nConsiderations in preparing funding plans\n3 year strategic plan prepared annually\nCustomer balance sheet growth\nAnnual funding plan as part of budgeting process\nForecasting in light of actual results as a calibration to the annual plan\nChanges in wholesale funding including: targeted funding volumes; markets; investors; tenors; and currencies for senior, secured, subordinated, hybrid transactions and market conditions\n164\n164\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n16. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\nLIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISK (continued)\nRESIDUAL CONTRACTUAL MATURITY ANALYSIS OF GROUP’S LIABILITIES The tables below provide residual contractual maturity analysis of financial liabilities, including financial liablities reclassified to held for sale, at 30 September within relevant maturity groupings. All outstanding debt issuance and subordinated debt is profiled on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay. All at-call liabilities are reported in the “Less than 3 months” category. Any other items without a specified maturity date are included in the “After 5 years” category.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES\nThe Group carries a significant number of financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. In addition the Group also holds assets classified as held for sale which are measured at fair value less costs to sell. The fair value is the best estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nVALUATION The Group has an established control framework, including appropriate segregation of duties, to ensure that fair values are accurately determined, reported and controlled. The framework includes the following features:\nproducts are approved for transacting with external customers and counterparties only where fair values can be appropriately determined;\nquoted market prices used to value financial instruments are independently verified with information from external pricing providers;\nfair value methodologies and inputs are evaluated and approved by a function independent of the party that undertakes the transaction;\nmovements in fair values are independently monitored and explained by reference to underlying factors relevant to the fair value; and\nvaluation adjustments (such as funding valuation adjustments, credit valuation adjustments and bid-offer adjustments) are independently validated and monitored.\nIf the Group holds offsetting risk positions, then the Group uses the portfolio exception in AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement (AASB 13) to measure the fair value of such groups of financial assets and financial liabilities. We measure the portfolio based on the price that would be received to sell a net long position (an asset) for a particular risk exposure, or to transfer a net short position (a liability) for a particular risk exposure.\nFair value designation\nWe designate certain loans and advances and certain deposits and other borrowings and debt issuances as fair value through profit or loss:\nwhere they contain a separable embedded derivative which significantly modifies the instruments’ cash flow; or\nin order to eliminate an accounting mismatch which would arise if the asset or liabilities were otherwise carried at amortised cost. This mismatch arises as we measure the derivative financial instruments (which we acquired to mitigate interest rate risk of the assets or liabilities) at fair value through profit or loss.\nOur approach ensures that we recognise the fair value movements on the assets or liabilities in profit or loss in the same period as the movement on the associated derivatives.\nWe may also designate certain loans and advances, certain deposits and other borrowings and debt issuances as fair value through profit or loss where they are managed on a fair value basis to align the measurement with how the instruments are managed.\nFAIR VALUE APPROACH AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES We use valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities for recognition, measurement and disclosure purposes where no quoted price in an active market exists for that asset or liability. This includes the following:\nAsset or Liability\nFair Value Approach\nFinancial instruments classified as:\nTrading securities\nSecurities sold short\nValuation techniques are used that incorporate observable market inputs for financial instruments with similar credit risk, maturity and yield characteristics. Equity instruments that are not traded in active markets may be measured using comparable company valuation multiples.\nDerivative financial assets and financial liabilities\nInvestment securities (from 1 October 2018)\nAvailable-for-sale assets (prior to 1 October 2018)\nFinancial instruments classified as:\nNet loans and advances\nDeposits and other borrowings\nDiscounted cash flow techniques are used whereby contractual future cash flows of the instrument are discounted using wholesale market interest rates, or market borrowing rates for debt with similar maturities or yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity.\nDebt issuances\nAssets and liabilities held for sale\nValuation based on the expected sale price before transaction costs.\n166\n166\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n17.

During the year, there were no material transfers from Level 2 to Level1 (2018: $953 million) in Trading Securities. Transfers from Level 1 to Level 2 for the year and previous periods are immaterial. Transfers into and out of levels are measured at the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred.\n2. On adoption of AASB 9 on 1 October 2018, the classification and measurement of financial assets was revised. The available-for-sale classification used in comparative periods no longer exists under AASB 9 and a new classification of investment securities was introduced. Comparative information has not been restated.\n3. The amount classified as Assets and Liabilities held for sale relates to assets and liabilities measured at fair value less cost to sell in accordance with AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. The amount presented reflects fair value excluding cost to sell but including intercompany eliminations.\n4. Payables and other liabilities relates to securities sold short, which we classify as held for trading and measured at fair value through profit or loss.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT INCORPORATING UNOBSERVABLE MARKET DATA\nLevel 3 fair value measurements\nThe net balance of Level 3 is an asset of $1,220 million (2018: $1,096 million). The assets and liabilities which incorporate significant unobservable inputs primarily include:\nequities for which there is no active market or traded prices cannot be observed;\nstructured credit products for which credit spreads and default probabilities relating to the reference assets and derivative counterparties cannot be observed;\nother derivatives referencing market rates that cannot be observed primarily due to lack of market activity.\nMovement in Level 3 balance is mainly due to the revaluation of the Group’s investment in Bank of Tianjin.\nThere were no material transfers in or out of Level 3 during the period.\n168\n168\n2018 $m\n37,722\n68,423\n\n74,284\n133\n44,623\n225,185\n2,332\n69,676\n1,171\n1,442\n46,829\n121,450\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n17. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (continued)\nBank of Tianjin (BoT) The investment is valued based on comparative price-to-book (P/B) multiples (a P/B multiple is the ratio of the market value of equity to the book value of equity). The extent of judgement applied in determining the appropriate multiple and comparator group from which the multiple is derived are non-observable inputs which have resulted in the Level 3 classification.\nSensitivity to Level 3 data inputs\nWhen we make assumptions due to significant inputs not being directly observable in the market place (Level 3 inputs), then changing these assumptions changes the Group’s estimate of the instrument’s fair value. Favourable and unfavourable changes are determined by changing the primary unobservable parameter used to derive the valuation.\nBank of Tianjin (BoT) The valuation of the BoT investment is sensitive to the selected unobservable input, being the P/B multiple. If the P/B multiple was increased or decreased by 10% it would result in a $111 million (2018: $102 million) increase or decrease to the fair value of the investment, which would be recognised in shareholders’ equity.\nOther The remaining Level 3 balance is immaterial and changes in the Level 3 inputs have a minimal impact on net profit and net assets of the Group.\nDeferred fair value gains and losses\nWhere fair values are determined using unobservable inputs significant to the fair value of a financial instrument, the Group does not immediately recognise the difference between the transaction price and the amount we determine based on the valuation technique (day one gain or loss) in profit or loss. After initial recognition, we recognise the deferred amount in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the life of the transaction or until all inputs become observable.\nThe day one gains and losses deferred are not material.\nFINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE\nThe following table sets out the Group’s basis of estimating fair values of financial instruments carried at amortised cost:\nFinancial Asset and Liability\nFair Value Approach\nInvestment securities - debt securities at amortised cost\nCalculated based on quoted market prices or observable inputs as applicable. If quoted market prices are not available, we use a discounted cash flow model using a yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity of the debt instrument. The fair value reflects adjustments to credit spreads applicable for that instrument.\nNet loans and advances to banks\nDiscounted cash flows using prevailing market rates for loans with similar credit quality.\nNet loans and advances to customers\nPresent value of future cash flows, discounted using a curve that incorporates changes in wholesale market rates, the Group’s cost of wholesale funding and the customer margin, as appropriate.\nDeposit liability without a specified maturity or at call\nThe amount payable on demand at the reporting date. We do not adjust the fair value for any value we expect the Group to derive from retaining the deposit for a future period.\nInterest bearing fixed maturity deposits and other borrowings and acceptances with quoted market rates\nMarket borrowing rates of interest for debt with a similar maturity are used to discount contractual cash flows to derive the fair value.\nDebt issuances\nCalculated based on quoted market prices or observable inputs as applicable. If quoted market prices are not available, we use a discounted cash flow model using a yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity of the debt instrument. The fair value reflects adjustments to credit spreads applicable to ANZ for that instrument.\n169\n169\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n17.

Investment securities under AASB 9 includes securities measured at amortised cost.\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nThe Group evaluates the material accuracy of the valuations incorporated in the financial statements as they can involve a high degree of judgement and estimation in determining the carrying values of financial assets and financial liabilities at the balance sheet date.\nThe majority of valuation models the Group uses employ only observable market data as inputs. However, for certain financial instruments, we may use data that is not readily observable in current markets. If we use unobservable market data, then we need to exercise more judgement to determine fair value depending on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation. Generally, we derive unobservable inputs from other relevant market data and compare them to observed transaction prices where available.\nWhen establishing the fair value of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, the Group considers valuation adjustments in determining the fair value. We may apply adjustments (such as bid/offer spreads, credit valuation adjustments and funding valuation adjustments – refer Note 10 Derivative Financial Instruments) to the techniques used to reflect the Group’s assessment of factors that market participants would consider in setting fair value.\n170\n170\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n18. ASSETS CHARGED AS SECURITY FOR LIABILITIES AND COLLATERAL ACCEPTED AS SECURITY FOR ASSETS\nThe following disclosure excludes the amounts presented as collateral paid and received in the Balance Sheet that relate to derivative liabilities and derivative assets respectively. The terms and conditions of those collateral agreements are included in the standard Credit Support Annex that forms part of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master Agreement.\nASSETS CHARGED AS SECURITY FOR LIABILITIES\nAssets charged as security for liabilities include the following types of instruments:\nSecurities provided as collateral for repurchase transactions.

Goodwill excludes notional goodwill in equity accounted investments. 2. 2018 includes an accelerated amortisation expense of $251 million. 3. Relates to discontinued operations in 2018 (refer to Note 29).\nGOODWILL ALLOCATED TO CASH-GENERATING UNITS (CGUs) An annual assessment is made as to whether the current carrying value of goodwill is impaired. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated at the date of acquisition to a CGU. Goodwill is considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of the relevant CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.\nTo estimate the recoverable amount of the CGU to which each goodwill component is allocated, we use a fair value less cost of disposal assessment approach for each segment.\nFAIR VALUE LESS COST OF DISPOSAL The Group has determined, using a market multiple approach, the fair value less costs of disposal of each CGU. This is primarily based on observable price earnings multiples reflecting the businesses and markets in which each CGU operates plus a control premium. The earnings are based on the current forecast earnings of the divisions. As at 30 September 2019, our impairment testing did not result in any material impairment being identified.\nFor each of ANZ’s CGUs with goodwill, the price earnings multiples applied were as follows:\nDivision\n2019\n2018\nAustralia Retail and Commercial\n17.9\n16.9\nInstitutional\n14.7\n14.6\nNew Zealand\n17.8\n16.8\nPacific\n17.7\n18.5\n173\n173\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n20. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nThe table below details how we recognise and measure different intangible assets:\nGoodwill\nSoftware\nOther Intangible Assets\nDefinition\nExcess amount the Group has paid in acquiring a business over the fair value less costs of disposal of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.\nPurchases of “off the shelf’ software assets are capitalised as assets.\nInternal and external costs incurred in building software and computer systems costing greater than $20 million are capitalised as assets. Those less than $20 million are expensed in the year in which the costs are incurred.\nManagement fee rights\nCarrying value\nCost less any accumulated impairment losses.\nAllocated to the cash generating unit to which the acquisition relates.\nInitially, measured at cost.\nSubsequently, carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.\nCosts incurred in planning or evaluating software proposals or in maintaining systems after implementation are not capitalised.\nInitially, measured at fair value at acquisition.\nSubsequently, carried at cost less impairment losses.\nUseful life\nIndefinite.\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or when there is an indication of impairment.\nExcept for major core infrastructure, amortised over periods between 3-5 years.\nMajor core infrastructure amortised over periods between 7 or 10 years.\nManagement fee rights with an indefinite life are reviewed for impairment at least annually or where there is an indication of impairment.\nDepreciation method\nNot applicable.\nStraight-line method.\nNot applicable.\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nManagement judgement is used to assess the recoverable value of goodwill, and other intangible assets, and the useful economic life of an asset, or if an asset has an indefinite life. We reassess the recoverability of the carrying value at each reporting date.\nThe carrying amount of goodwill is based on judgements including the basis of assumptions and forecasts used for determining earnings for CGUs, headroom availability, and sensitivities of the forecasts to reasonably possible changes in assumptions. The level at which goodwill is allocated, the estimation of future earnings and the selection of earnings multiples applied requires significant judgement.\nAt each balance date, software and other intangible assets, including those not yet ready for use, are assessed for indicators of impairment. In the event that an asset’s carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount, the carrying value of the asset is written down immediately.\nIn addition, the expected useful life of intangible assets, including software assets, are assessed at each reporting date. The assessment requires management judgement, and in relation to our software assets, a number of factors can influence the expected useful lives. These factors include changes to business strategy, significant divestments and the underlying pace of technological change.\n174\n174\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n21.

Customer remediation includes a $63 million transfer to the purchaser on completion of divestment of part of Wealth Australia discontinued operations.\nCustomer remediation Customer remediation includes provisions for expected refunds to customers, remediation project costs and related customer and regulatory claims, penalties and litigation outcomes.\nRestructuring costs Provisions for restructuring costs arise from activities related to material changes in the scope of business undertaken by the Group or the manner in which that business is undertaken and include employee termination benefits. Costs relating to on-going activities are not provided for and are expensed as incurred.\nNon-lending losses, frauds and forgeries Non-lending losses include losses arising from certain legal actions not directly related to amounts of principal outstanding for loans and advances and losses arising from forgeries, frauds and the correction of operational issues. The amounts recognised are the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties that surround the events and circumstances that affect the provision.\nOther Other provisions comprise various other provisions including workers compensation, make-good provisions associated with leased premises, warranties and indemnities provided in connection with various disposals of businesses and assets, and contingent liabilities recognised as part of a business combination.\n175\n175\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n21. OTHER PROVISIONS (continued)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nThe Group recognises provisions when there is a present obligation arising from a past event, an outflow of economic resources is probable, and the amount of the provision can be measured reliably.\nThe amount recognised is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the timing and amount of the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the estimated cash flows required to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nThe Group holds provisions for various obligations including customer remediation, restructuring costs and surplus lease space, non- lending losses, fraud and forgeries and litigation related claims. These provisions involve judgements regarding the timing and outcome of future events, including estimates of expenditure required to satisfy such obligations. Where relevant, expert legal advice has been obtained and, in light of such advice, provisions and/or disclosures as deemed appropriate have been made.\nIn relation to customer remediation, determining the amount of the provisions, which represent management’s best estimate of the cost of settling the identified matters, requires the exercise of significant judgement. It will often be necessary to form a view on a number of different assumptions, including, the number of impacted customers, the average refund per customer, the associated remediation project costs, and the implications of regulatory exposures and customer claims having regard to their specific facts and circumstances. Consequently, the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions is reviewed on a regular basis against actual experience and other relevant evidence including expert legal advices and adjustments are made to the provisions where appropriate.\n176\n176\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22.

The Company completed a $3.0 billion on-market share buy-back of ANZ ordinary shares purchasing $1,120 million in the September 2019 full year (Sep 18 full year: $1,880 million) resulting in 42.0 million ANZ ordinary shares being cancelled in the September 2019 full year (Sep 18 full year: 66.7 million).\n3. The successor fund transfer performed in preparation for the sale of the Group’s wealth business to Zurich and IOOF completed on 13 April 2019.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY (continued)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nOrdinary shares\nOrdinary shares have no par value. They entitle holders to receive dividends, or proceeds available on winding up of the Company, in proportion to the number of fully paid ordinary shares held. They are recognised at the amount paid per ordinary share net of directly attributable costs. Every holder of fully paid ordinary shares present at a meeting in person, or by proxy, is entitled to:\non a show of hands, one vote; and  on a poll, one vote, for each share held.\nTreasury shares\nTreasury shares are shares in the Company which:\nthe ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan purchases on market and have not yet distributed, or\nthe Company issues to the ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan and have not yet been distributed, or\nthe life insurance business purchased and held to back policy liabilities in the\nstatutory funds prior to the successor fund transfer performed in preparation for the sale of the Group’s wealth business to Zurich and IOOF which completed on 13 April 2019. Treasury shares are deducted from share capital and excluded from the weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the earnings per share calculations.\nReserves:\nForeign currency translation reserve\nIncludes differences arising on translation of assets and liabilities into Australian dollars when the functional currency of a foreign operation (including subsidiaries and branches) is not Australian dollars. In this reserve, we reflect any offsetting gains or losses on hedging these exposures, together with any tax effect.\nCash flow hedge reserve\nIncludes fair value gains and losses associated with the effective portion of designated cash flow hedging instruments together with any tax effect.\nAvailable-for-sale reserve (prior to 1 October 2018)\nIncludes the changes in fair value and exchange differences on our revaluation of available- for-sale financial assets together with any tax effect.\nFVOCI reserve (from 1 October 2018)\nIncludes changes in the fair value of certain debt securities and equity securities included within Investment Securities together with any tax effect.\nIn respect of debt securities classified as measured at FVOCI, the FVOCI reserve records accumulated changes in fair value arising subsequent to initial recognition, except for those relating to allowance for expected credit losses, interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses which are recognised in profit or loss. As debt securities at FVOCI are recorded at fair value, the balance of the FVOCI reserve is net of the ECL allowance associated with such assets. When a debt security measured at FVOCI is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in the FVOCI reserve in respect of that security is reclassified to profit or loss and presented in Other Operating Income.\nIn respect of the equity securities classified as measured at FVOCI, the FVOCI reserve records accumulated changes in fair value arising subsequent to initial recognition (including any related foreign exchange gains or losses). When an equity security measured at FVOCI is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in the FVOCI reserve in respect of that security is not recycled to profit or loss.\nShare option reserve\nIncludes amounts which arise on the recognition of share-based compensation expense.\nTransactions with non-controlling interests reserve\nIncludes the impact of transactions with non-controlling shareholders in their capacity as shareholders.\nNon-controlling interests\nShare in the net assets of controlled entities attributable to equity interests which the Company does not own directly or indirectly.\n178\n178\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n23. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY\nANZ’s capital management strategy aims to protect the interests of depositors, creditors and shareholders. We achieve this through an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) whereby ANZ conducts detailed strategic and capital planning over a 3 year time horizon. The process involves:\nforecasting economic variables, financial performance of ANZ’s divisions and the financial impact of new strategic initiatives to be implemented during the planning period;\nperforming stress tests under different economic scenarios to determine the level of additional capital (‘stress capital buffer’) needed to absorb losses that may be experienced under an economic downturn;\nreviewing capital ratios and targets across various classes of capital against ANZ’s risk profile; and  developing a capital plan, taking into account capital ratio targets, current and future capital issuances requirements and options around capital products, timing and markets to execute the capital plan under differing market and economic conditions.\nThe capital plan is approved by the Board and updated as required. The Board and senior management are provided with regular updates of ANZ’s capital position. Any material actions required to ensure ongoing prudent capital management are submitted to the Board for approval. Throughout the year, the Group maintained compliance with all the regulatory requirements related to Capital Adequacy in the jurisdictions in which it operates.\nREGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\nAustralia As ANZ is an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) in Australia, it is primarily regulated by APRA under the Banking Act 1959 (Cth). ANZ must comply with the minimum regulatory capital requirements, prudential capital ratios and specific reporting levels that APRA sets and which are consistent with the global Basel III capital framework. This is the common framework for determining the appropriate level of bank regulatory capital as set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”). APRA requirements are summarised below:\nRegulatory Capital Definition\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital\nTier 1 Capital\nTier 2 Capital\nTotal Capital\nShareholders’ equity adjusted for specific items.\nCET1 Capital plus certain securities with complying loss absorbing characteristics known as Additional Tier 1 Capital.\nSubordinated debt instruments which have a minimum term of 5 years at issue date.\nTier 1 plus Tier 2 Capital.\nMinimum Prudential Capital Ratios (PCRs)\nCET1 Ratio\nTier 1 Ratio\nTotal Capital Ratio\nCET1 Capital divided by total risk weighted assets must be at least 4.5%.\nTier 1 Capital divided by total risk weighted assets must be at least 6.0%.\nTotal Capital divided by total risk weighted assets must be at least 8.0%.\nReporting Levels\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nThe ADI on a stand-alone basis (that is the Company and specified subsidiaries which are consolidated to form the ADI’s Extended Licensed Entity).\nThe consolidated Group less certain subsidiaries and associates that are excluded under prudential standards.\nA conglomerate Group at the widest level.\nAPRA also requires the ADI to hold additional CET1 buffers as follows:\nA capital conservation buffer (CCB) of 3.5% which is inclusive of the additional 1% surcharge for domestically systemically important banks (D-SIBs). APRA has determined that ANZ is a D-SIB.\nA countercyclical capital buffer which is set on a jurisdictional basis. The requirement is currently set to zero for Australia.\nANZ reports to APRA on a Level 1 and Level 2 basis, and measures capital adequacy monthly on a Level 1 and Level 2 basis, and is not yet required to maintain capital on a Level 3 basis (APRA have yet to conclude required timing for Level 3 reporting).\nLife Insurance and Funds Management As required by APRA’s Prudential Standards, insurance and funds management activities are:\nde-consolidated for the purposes of calculating capital adequacy; and  excluded from the risk based capital adequacy framework.\nWe deduct the investment in these controlled entities 100% from CET1 capital, and if we include any profits from these activities in the Group’s results, then we exclude them from the determination of CET1 capital to the extent they have not been remitted to the Company.\n179\n179\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n23. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (continued)\nOutside Australia In addition to APRA, the Company’s branch operations and major banking subsidiary operations are also overseen by local regulators such as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the US Federal Reserve, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission. They may impose minimum capital levels on operations in their individual jurisdictions.\nCAPITAL ADEQUACY1\nThe following table provides details of the Group’s capital adequacy ratios at 30 September:\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\nQualifying capital\nTier 1\nShareholders' equity and non-controlling interests2\n60,794\n59,383\nPrudential adjustments to shareholders' equity\n120\n(322)\nGross Common Equity Tier 1 capital\n60,914\n59,061\nDeductions\n(13,559)\n(14,370)\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital\n47,355\n44,691\nAdditional Tier 1 capital\n7,866\n7,527\nTier 1 capital\n55,221\n52,218\nTier 2 capital\n8,549\n7,291\nTotal qualifying capital\n63,770\n59,509\nCapital adequacy ratios (Level 2)\nCommon Equity Tier 1\n11.4%\n11.4%\nTier 1\n13.2%\n13.4%\nTier 2\n2.1%\n1.9%\nTotal capital ratio\n15.3%\n15.2%\nRisk weighted assets\n416,961\n390,820\n1.

CONTROLLED ENTITIES (continued)\nCHANGES TO MATERIAL CONTROLLED ENTITIES\nThe following changes to our material entities have occurred during the year ended 30 September 2019.\nIn September 2018, the business of Share Investing Limited was sold to CMC Markets Stockbroking Limited. Share Investing Limited and its immediate parent company, ACN 003 042 082 Limited, are no longer considered to be material entities.\nIn November 2018, OnePath Life (NZ) Limited was sold to Cigna Corporation and the business of ANZ Europe Limited (formerly ANZ Bank (Europe) Limited) was wound up. ANZ Europe Limited is no longer considered to be a material entity.\nIn March 2019, the business of ANZ (Lao) Sole Company Limited (formerly ANZ Bank (Lao) Limited) was transferred to a newly established Laos branch of the Company. ANZ (Lao) Sole Company Limited is no longer considered to be a material entity.\nIn April 2019, ANZ Bank (Taiwan) Limited merged with the Taiwan branch of the Company.\nIn May 2019, OnePath General Insurance Pty Limited, OnePath Life Australia Holdings Pty Limited and OnePath Life Limited were sold to Zurich Financial Services Australia (Zurich). See note 29 for further details.\nIn August 2019, we completed the sale of our 55% share of ANZ Royal Bank (Cambodia) Limited to J-Trust.\nAs ANZ Finance Guam, Inc and ANZ Commodity Trading Pty Ltd no longer have material business and Votraint No. 1103 Pty Limited’s only business is to hold the Group’s investment in PT Bank Pan Indonesia (see note 26), these companies are no longer considered to be material entities.\nWe did not acquire, or dispose of, any material entities during the year ended 30 September 2018.\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nThe Group’s subsidiaries are those entities it controls through:\nbeing exposed to, or having rights to, variable returns from the entity; and\nbeing able to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\nThe Group assesses whether it has power over those entities by examining the Group’s existing rights to direct the relevant activities of the entity.\nIf the Group sells or acquires subsidiaries during the year, it includes their operating results in the Group results to the date of disposal or from the date of acquisition. When the Group’s control ceases, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any related non- controlling interest and other components of equity.\nWhen the Group ceases to control a subsidiary, it:\nmeasures any retained interest in the entity at fair value; and\nrecognises any resulting gain or loss in profit or loss.\nIf the Group’s ownership interest in a subsidiary changes in a way that does not result in a loss of control, then the Group accounts for that as a transaction with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders.\nAll transactions between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.\n183\n183\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n26.

Market Value is based on a price per share and does not include any adjustments for the size of our holding.\nIMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT\nAs at 30 September 2019, for AMMB Holdings Berhad (AmBank) and PT Bank Pan Indonesia (PT Panin), the market value (based on share price) was below the respective carrying values of these investments. The Group performed value-in-use (VIU) calculations to assess whether the carrying value of the investments was impaired. The VIU calculations supported the carrying value for both AmBank and PT Panin.\n184\n184\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES (continued)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence over its operating and financial policies but does not control. The Group accounts for associates using the equity method. Its investments in associates are carried at cost plus the post-acquisition share of changes in the associate’s net assets less accumulated impairments. Dividends the Group receives from associates are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. The Group includes goodwill relating to the associate in the carrying amount of the investment. It does not individually test the goodwill incorporated in the associates carrying amount for impairment.\nAt least at each reporting date, the Group reviews investments in associates for any indication of impairment. If an indication of impairment exists, then the Group determines the recoverable amount of the associate using the higher of:\nthe associate’s fair value less cost of disposal; and  its value-in use.\nWe use a discounted cash flow methodology, and other methodologies (such as capitalisation of earnings methodology), to determine the recoverable amount.\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nThe value-in-use calculation is sensitive to a number of key assumptions requiring management judgement, including future profitability levels, capital levels, long term growth rates and discount rates. A change in any of the key assumptions below could have an adverse effect on the recoverable amount of the investments. The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation are outlined below:\nAs at 30 September 2019\nAmBank\nPT Panin\nPost-tax discount rate\n10.7%\n13.3%\nTerminal growth rate\n4.8%\n5.3%\nExpected NPAT growth (compound annual growth rate – 5 years)\n4.1%\n6.5%\nCore Equity Tier 1 rate\n11.9% to 12.7%\n11.6%\n185\n185\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n27. STRUCTURED ENTITIES\nA Structured Entity (SE) is an entity that has been designed such that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in determining who controls the entity. SEs are generally established with restrictions on their ongoing activities in order to achieve narrow and well defined objectives.\nSEs are classified as subsidiaries and consolidated when control exists. If the Group does not control a SE, then it is not consolidated. This note provides information on both consolidated and unconsolidated SEs.\nThe Group’s involvement with SEs is as follows:\nType\nDetails\nSecuritisation\nThe Group controls SEs established to securitise customer loans and advances that it has originated, in order to diversify sources of funding for liquidity management. Such transactions involve transfers to an internal securitisation (bankruptcy remote) vehicle used to create assets that are eligible for repurchase under agreements with the applicable central bank (these are known as ‘Repo eligible’). These internal securitisation SEs are consolidated. Refer to Note 28 Transfers of Financial Assets for further details.\nThe Group also establishes SEs on behalf of customers to securitise their loans or receivables. The Group may manage these securitisation vehicles or provide liquidity or other support. Additionally, the Group may acquire interests in securitisation vehicles set up by third parties through holding securities issued by such entities. In limited circumstances where control exists, the Group consolidates the SE.\nCovered bond issuances\nCertain loans and advances have been assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs to provide security for issuances of debt securities by the Group. The Group retains control over these SEs and therefore they are consolidated. Refer to Note 28 Transfers of Financial Assets for further details.\nStructured finance arrangements\nThe Group is involved with SEs established:\nin connection with structured lending transactions to facilitate debt syndication and/or to ring-fence collateral; and\nto own assets that are leased to customers in structured leasing transactions.\nThe Group may manage the SE, hold minor amounts of the SE’s capital, or provide risk management products (derivatives) to the SE. In most instances, the Group does not control these SEs. In limited circumstances where control exists, the Group consolidates the SE.\nFunds management activities\nThe Group conducts investment management and other fiduciary activities as a responsible entity, trustee, custodian or manager for investment funds and trusts – including superannuation funds and wholesale and retail trusts (collectively ‘Investment Funds’). The Investment Funds are financed through the issuance of puttable units to investors and the Group considers them to be SEs. The Group’s exposure to Investment Funds is limited to receiving fees for services and derivatives entered into for risk management purposes. These interests do not create significant exposures to the funds that would allow the Group to control the funds. Therefore, the funds are not consolidated.\n186\n186\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n27. STRUCTURED ENTITIES (continued)\nCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES\nFINANCIAL OR OTHER SUPPORT PROVIDED TO CONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES The Group provides financial support to consolidated SEs as outlined below. As these are intra-group transactions, they are eliminated on consolidation:\nSecuritisation and covered bond issuances\nThe Group provides lending facilities, derivatives and commitments to these SEs and/or holds debt instruments that they have issued.\nStructured finance arrangements\nThe assets held by these SEs are normally pledged as collateral for financing provided. Certain consolidated SEs are financed entirely by the Group while others are financed by syndicated loan facilities in which the Group is a participant. The financing provided by the Group includes lending facilities where the Group’s exposure is limited to the amount of the loan and any undrawn amount. Additionally, the Group has provided Letters of Support to these consolidated SEs confirming that the Group will not demand repayment of the financing provided for the ensuing 12 month period.\nThe Group did not provide any non-contractual support to consolidated SEs during the year (2018: nil). Other than as disclosed above, the Group does not have any current intention to provide financial or other support to consolidated SEs.\nUNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES\nGROUP’S INTEREST IN UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES An ‘interest’ in an unconsolidated SE is any form of contractual or non-contractual involvement with a SE that exposes the Group to variability of returns from the performance of that SE. These interests include, but are not limited to: holdings of debt or equity securities; derivatives that pass-on risks specific to the performance of the SE; lending; loan commitments; financial guarantees; and fees from funds management activities.\nFor the purpose of disclosing interests in unconsolidated SEs:\nno disclosure is made if the Group’s involvement is not more than a passive interest - for example: when the Group’s involvement constitutes a typical customer-supplier relationship. On this basis, exposures to unconsolidated SEs that arise from lending, trading and investing activities are not considered disclosable interests - unless the design of the structured entity allows the Group to participate in decisions about the relevant activities (being those that significantly affect the entity’s returns).\n‘interests’ do not include derivatives intended to expose the Group to market-risk (rather than performance risk specific to the SE) or derivatives through which the Group creates, rather than absorbs, variability of the unconsolidated SE (such as purchase of credit protection under a credit default swap).\nThe table below sets out the Group’s interests in unconsolidated SEs together with the maximum exposure to loss that could arise from those interests:\nSecuritisation and structured finance\nInvestment funds\nTotal\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\nOn-balance sheet interests\nInvestment securities1\n1,923\n\n\n\n1,923\n\nAvailable-for-sale assets1\n\n1,715\n\n\n\n1,715\nInvestments backing policy liabilities\n\n\n\n18\n\n18\nGross loans and advances\n7,789\n7,018\n\n\n7,789\n7,018\nTotal on-balance sheet\n9,712\n8,733\n\n18\n9,712\n8,751\nOff-balance sheet interests\nCommitments (facilities undrawn)\n1,540\n1,381\n\n\n1,540\n1,381\nGuarantees\n67\n10\n\n\n67\n10\nTotal off-balance sheet\n1,607\n1,391\n\n\n1,607\n1,391\nMaximum exposure to loss\n11,319\n10,124\n\n18\n11,319\n10,142\n1. On adoption of AASB 9 on 1 October 2018, the classification and measurement of financial assets were revised. Available-for-sale classification used in comparative periods ceases to exist under AASB 9 and a new classification of investment securities was introduced. Refer Note 1 and 35 for further details. Comparative information has not been restated.\nIn addition to the interests above, the Group earned funds management fees from unconsolidated SEs of $509 million (2018: $505 million) during the year.\n187\n187\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n27. STRUCTURED ENTITIES (continued)\nThe Group’s maximum exposure to loss represents the maximum amount of loss that the Group could incur as a result of its involvement with unconsolidated SEs if loss events were to take place — regardless of the probability of occurrence. This does not in any way represent the actual losses expected to be incurred. Furthermore, the maximum exposure to loss is stated gross of the effects of hedging and collateral arrangements entered into to mitigate ANZ’s exposure to loss.\nThe maximum exposure to loss has been determined as:\nthe carrying amount of Investment securities measured at amortised cost (from 1 October 2018), available-for-sale assets (prior to 1 October 2018) and investments backing policy liabilities; and\nthe carrying amount plus the undrawn amount of any committed loans and advances.\nInformation about the size of the unconsolidated SEs that the Group is involved with is as follows:\nSecuritisation and structured finance: size is indicated by total assets which vary by SE with a maximum value of approximately $1.1 billion (2018: $1.0 billion); and\nInvestment funds: size is indicated by Funds Under Management which vary by SE with a maximum value of approximately $38.8 billion (2018: $36.9 billion).\nThe Group did not provide any non-contractual support to unconsolidated SEs during the year (2018: nil) nor does it have any current intention to provide financial or other support to unconsolidated SEs.\nSPONSORED UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES\nThe Group may also sponsor unconsolidated SEs in which it has no disclosable interest.\nFor the purposes of this disclosure, the Group considers itself the ‘sponsor’ of an unconsolidated SE if it is the primary party involved in the design and establishment of that SE and:\nthe Group is the major user of that SE; or\nthe Group’s name appears in the name of that SE, or on its products; or\nthe Group provides implicit or explicit guarantees of that SE’s performance.\nThe Group has sponsored the ANZ PIE Fund in New Zealand, which invests only in deposits with ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited. The Group does not provide any implicit or explicit guarantees of the capital value or performance of investments in the ANZ PIE Fund. There was no income received from, nor assets transferred to, this entity during the year.\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nSignificant judgement is required in assessing whether control exists over Structured Entities involved in securitisation activities and structured finance transactions, and investment funds. Judgement is required to determine the existence of:\npower over the relevant activities (being those that significantly affect the entity’s returns); and\nexposure to variable returns of that entity.\n188\n188\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n28. TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\nIn the normal course of business the Group enters into transactions where it transfers financial assets directly to third parties or to SEs. These transfers may give rise to the Group fully, or partially, derecognising those financial assets - depending on the Group’s exposure to the risks and rewards or control over the transferred assets. If the Group retains substantially all of the risk and rewards of a transferred asset, the transfer does not qualify for derecognition and the asset remains on the Group’s balance sheet in its entirety.\nSECURITISATIONS Net loans and advances include residential mortgages securitised under the Group’s securitisation programs which are assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs to provide security for obligations payable on the notes issued by the SEs. The holders of the issued notes have full recourse to the pool of residential mortgages which have been securitised and the Group cannot otherwise pledge or dispose of the transferred assets.\nIn some instances the Group is also the holder of the securitised notes. In addition, the Group is entitled to any residual income of the SEs and sometimes enters into derivatives with the SEs. The Group retains the risks and rewards of the residential mortgages and continues to recognise the mortgages as financial assets. The obligation to pay this amount to the SE is recognised as a financial liability of the Group.\nThe Group is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with these securitisation SEs and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the SEs activities. The SEs are therefore consolidated by the Group.\nCOVERED BONDS The Group operates various global covered bond programs to raise funding in its primary markets. Net loans and advances include residential mortgages assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs associated with these covered bond programs. The mortgages provide security for the obligations payable on the issued covered bonds.\nThe covered bond holders have dual recourse to the issuer and the cover pool of assets. The issuer cannot otherwise pledge or dispose of the transferred assets, however, subject to legal arrangements it may repurchase and substitute assets as long as the required cover is maintained.\nThe Group is required to maintain the cover pool at a level sufficient to cover the bond obligations. In addition, the Group is entitled to any residual income of the covered bond SEs and enters into derivatives with the SEs. The Group retains the majority of the risks and rewards of the residential mortgages and continues to recognise the mortgages as financial assets. The obligation to pay this amount to the SEs is recognised as a financial liability of the Group.\nThe Group is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with the covered bond SEs and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the SEs activities. The SEs are therefore consolidated by the Group. The covered bonds issued externally are included within debt issuances.\nREPURCHASE AGREEMENTS When the Group sells securities subject to repurchase agreements under which we retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, then those assets do not qualify for derecognition. An associated liability is recognised for the consideration received from the counterparty.\nSTRUCTURED FINANCE ARRANGEMENTS The Group arranges funding for certain customer transactions through structured leasing and commodity prepayment arrangements. These transactions are recognised on Group’s balance sheet as lease receivables or loans. At times, other financial institutions participate in the funding of these arrangements. This participation involves a proportionate transfer of the rights to the assets recognised by the Group. The participating banks have limited recourse to the leased assets or financed commodity and related proceeds. Where the Group continues to be exposed to some of the risks of the transferred assets through a derivative or other continuing involvement, the Group does not derecognise the lease receivable or loan. Instead, the Group recognises an associated liability representing its obligations to the participating financial institutions.\nThe table below sets out the balance of assets transferred that do not qualify for derecognition, along with the associated liabilities:\nSecuritisations1,2\nCovered bonds\nRepurchase agreements\nStructured finance arrangements\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\nCurrent carrying amount of assets transferred\n2,422\n1,239\n30,799\n29,455\n43,213\n40,164\n81\n96\nCarrying amount of associated liabilities\n2,411\n1,232\n20,957\n17,846\n41,367\n38,378\n81\n88\n1. Does not include transfers to internal structured entities where there are no external investors. 2. The securitisation noteholders have recourse only to the pool of residential mortgages which have been securitised. The carrying value of securitised assets and the associated liabilities approximates their fair value.\n189\n189\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n29. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nOn 17 October 2017, the Group announced it had agreed to sell its OnePath P&I and ADGs business to IOOF. The sale of the ADGs business completed on 1 October 2018. On 17 October 2019, the Group announced it had agreed a revised sale price for its OnePath P&I business and ADGs to IOOF of $850 million, being a $125 million reduction from the original sale price of $975 million announced in October 2017. The new price of $850 million includes approximately $25 million that ANZ has already received for the sale of the ADGs in October 2018. The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements. Subject to APRA approval, the Group expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. The impact of the reduction in price has been reflected in the 2019 financial results.\nOn 12 December 2017, ANZ announced that it had agreed to the sale of its life insurance business to Zurich Financial Services Australia (Zurich) and regulatory approval was obtained on 10 October 2018. The transaction was completed on 31 May 2019.\nAs a result of the sale transactions outlined above, the financial results of the businesses to be divested and associated Group reclassification and consolidation impacts are treated as discontinued operations from a financial reporting perspective.\nDetails of the financial performance and cash flows of discontinued operations are shown below.\nIncome Statement\n2019 $m\nNet interest income Other operating income1\n(76)\n245\nOperating income Operating expenses1\n169\n(449)\nProfit/(Loss) before credit impairment and income tax\n(280)\nCredit impairment (charge)/release\n1\nProfit/(Loss) before income tax Income tax expense1\n(279)\n(64)\nProfit/(Loss) for the period attributable to shareholders of the Company1,2\n(343)\n1.

The loss is recognised in continuing operations.\n$21 million loss after tax relating to the reclassification of the PNG Retail, Commercial and SME businesses to held for sale, comprising a $12 million impairment of goodwill, $7 million costs associated with the sale and a $2 million tax expense. The loss is recognised in continuing operations.\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nLIFE INSURANCE CONTRACT LIABILITIES AND LIABILITIES CEDED UNDER REINSURANCE CONTRACTS We calculate Life insurance contract Liabilities under the Margin on Service (MoS) model using a projection method based on actuarial principles and standards.\nWe discount the expected future cash flows of these contracts at the risk-free discount rate.\nLIFE INVESTMENT CONTRACT LIABILITIES A life investment contract liability is measured at fair value and is directly linked to the fair value of the assets that back it. For guaranteed policies, we determine the liability as the net present value of expected cash flows, subject to a minimum of current surrender value.\nEXTERNAL UNIT HOLDER LIABILITIES The life insurance business includes controlling interests in investment funds which we aggregate. When we aggregate a controlled investment fund, we recognise the external unit holder liabilities as a liability and include them on the balance sheet in external unit holder liabilities.\nINVESTMENTS BACKING POLICY LIABILITIES Our determination of fair value of investments backing policy liabilities involves the same judgement as other financial assets as described in Note 17 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\n192\n192\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n29. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE (continued)\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nA significant level of judgement is used by the Group to determine:\nwhether an asset or group of assets is classified and presented as held for sale or as a discontinued operation; and\nthe fair value of the assets and liabilities classified as being held for sale.\nManagement is required to exercise significant judgement when assessing the fair value less costs to sell for assets and liabilities held for sale. The judgemental factors include determining: costs to sell, allocation of goodwill, indemnities provided under the sale contract and consideration received - particularly where elements of consideration are contingent in nature. Any impairment we record is based on the best available evidence of fair value compared to the carrying value before the impairment. The final sale price may be different to the fair value we estimate when recording the impairment. Management regularly assess the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions against actual outcomes and other relevant evidence and adjustments are made to fair value where appropriate. We expect that the sales will complete within 12 months after balance date, subject to the relevant regulatory approvals and customary terms of sale for such assets.\nLife Insurance Liabilities continue to be measured in accordance with AASB 1038. The Group is largely insulated from significant changes to the carrying value of the liability due to the share sale agreements.\nOur estimates of life insurance liabilities are affected by: regulation, competition, interest rates, inflation, taxes and general economic conditions.\nWe have performed sensitivity analysis on key variables influencing the insurance liabilities and assets - namely: interest, inflation, mortality, morbidity and discontinuance risk. We have determined that there would be no material impact to the Group for a reasonable change in any of these variables after taking into account of the share sale agreements.\n193\n193\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n30. SUPERANNUATION AND POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS\nSet out below is a summary of amounts recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of the defined benefit superannuation schemes:\n2019 $m\nDefined benefit obligation and scheme assets\nPresent value of funded defined benefit obligation\n(1,538)\nFair value of scheme assets\n1,739\nNet defined benefit asset\n201\nAs represented in the Balance Sheet\nNet liabilities arising from defined benefit obligations included in payables and other liabilities\n(54)\nNet assets arising from defined benefit obligations included in other assets\n255\nNet defined benefit asset\n201\nWeighted average duration of the benefit payments reflected in the defined benefit obligation (years)\n14.9\nAs at the most recent reporting dates of the schemes, the aggregate surplus of net market value of assets over the value of accrued benefits on a funding basis was $48 million (2018: surplus of $21 million). In 2019, the Group made defined benefit contributions totaling $3 million (2018: $5 million). It expects to make contributions of around $3 million next financial year.\nGOVERNANCE OF THE SCHEMES AND FUNDING OF THE DEFINED BENEFIT SECTIONS\nThe main defined benefit superannuation schemes in which the Group participates operate under trust law and are managed and administered on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the relevant trust deed and rules and all relevant legislation. These schemes have corporate trustees, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group. The trustees are the legal owners of the assets, which are held separately from the assets of the Group, and are responsible for setting investment policy and agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the triennial actuarial valuation process.\nThe Group has defined benefit arrangements in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Philippines, Taiwan and United Kingdom. The defined benefit section of the ANZ Australian Staff Superannuation Scheme, the ANZ UK Staff Pension Scheme and the ANZ National Retirement Scheme in New Zealand are the three largest plans. They have been closed to new members since 1987, 2004 and 1991 respectively. None of the schemes had a material deficit, or surplus, at the last funding valuation. The Group has no present liability under any of the schemes’ trust deeds to fund a deficit (measured on a funding basis). A contingent liability of the Group may arise if any of the schemes were wound up.\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nDefined benefit superannuation schemes The Group operates a small number of defined benefit schemes. Independent actuaries calculate the liability and expenses related to providing benefits to employees under each defined benefit scheme. They use the Projected Unit Credit Method to value the liabilities. The balance sheet includes:\na defined benefit liability if the obligation is greater than the fair value of the schemes assets; and\nan asset (capped to its recoverable amount) if the fair value of the assets is greater than the obligation.\nIn each reporting period, the movements in the net defined benefit liability are recognised as follows:\nthe net movement relating to the current period’s service cost, net interest on the defined benefit liability, past service costs and other costs (such as the effects of any curtailments and settlements) as operating expenses;\nremeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (which comprise actuarial gains and losses and return on scheme assets, excluding interest income included in net interest) directly in retained earnings through other comprehensive income; and\ncontributions of the Group directly against the net defined benefit position.\nDefined contribution superannuation schemes\nThe Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes. It also contributes (according to local law, in the various countries in which it operates) to Government and other plans that have the characteristics of defined contribution plans. The Group’s contributions to these schemes are recognised as personnel expenses when they are incurred.\n194\n194\n2018 $m\n(1,418)\n1,551\n133\n(21)\n154\n133\n16.8\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n30.

EMPLOYEE SHARE AND OPTION PLANS\nANZ operates a number of employee share and option schemes under the ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan and the ANZ Share Option Plan.\nANZ EMPLOYEE SHARE ACQUISITION PLAN ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan schemes that operated during the 2019 and 2018 years were the Employee Share Offer and the Deferred Share Plan.\nEmployee Share Offer\nEligibility\nMost permanent employees employed in either Australia or New Zealand with three years continuous service for the most recent financial year.\nGrant\nUp to AUD 1,000 in Australia (and AUD 800 in New Zealand) ANZ shares each financial year, subject to Board approval.\nAllocation value\nOne week Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of ANZ shares traded on the ASX in the week leading up to and including the date of grant.\nAustralia\nANZ ordinary shares are granted to eligible employees for nil consideration. The shares vest on grant and are held in trust for three years from grant date, after which time they may remain in trust, be transferred to the employee’s name or sold. Dividends are automatically reinvested in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan.\nNew Zealand\nShares are granted to eligible employees on payment of NZD one cent per share. Shares vest subject to satisfaction of a three year service period, after which they may remain in trust, be transferred to the employee’s name or sold. Unvested shares are forfeited if the employee resigns or is dismissed for serious misconduct. Dividends are either paid in cash or reinvested into the Dividend Reinvestment Plan.\nExpensing value (fair value)\nIn Australia, the fair value of the shares is expensed in the year shares are granted, as they are not subject to forfeiture.\nIn New Zealand, the fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the three year vesting period.\nThe expense is recognised as a share-based compensation expense with a corresponding increase in equity.\n2019 and 2018 grants\n656,738 shares were granted on 3 December 2018 at an issue price of $26.91.\n541,982 shares were granted on 1 December 2017 at an issue price of $28.67.\n195\n195\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n31.

Deferred over three years from grant date.\niii) Long Term Incentives (LTIs)\nEligibility\nSelected employees.\nGrant\n100% deferred shares.\nConditions\nVest three years from grant date.\niv) Exceptional circumstances\nRemuneration foregone\nIn exceptional circumstances, we grant deferred shares to certain employees when they start with ANZ to compensate them for remuneration they have foregone from their previous employer. The vesting period generally aligns with the remaining vesting period of the remuneration they have foregone, and therefore varies between grants.\nRetention\nWe may grant deferred shares to high performing employees who are regarded as a significant retention risk to ANZ.\nv) Further information\nCessation\nUnless the Board decides otherwise, employees forfeit their unvested deferred shares if they resign, are terminated on notice, or are dismissed for serious misconduct. The deferred shares may be held in trust beyond the deferral period.\nDividends\nDividends are paid in cash or reinvested in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan.\nInstrument\nDeferred share rights may be granted instead of deferred shares in some countries as locally appropriate (see deferred share rights section).\nAllocation value\nAll deferred shares are issued based on the VWAP of ANZ shares traded on the ASX in the week leading up to and including the date of grant.\nExpensing value (fair value) We expense the fair value of deferred shares on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period and we\n2019 and 2018 grants\nDownward adjustment\nrecognise the expense as a share-based compensation expense with a corresponding increase in equity. During the 2019 year, we granted 1,945,668 deferred shares (2018: 2,232,563) with a weighted average grant price of $25.39 (2018: $29.31). Deferred shares remain at risk and the Board has the discretion to adjust the number of deferred shares downwards, including to zero at any time before the vesting date. ANZ’s downward adjustment provisions are detailed in section 6.3 of the 2019 Remuneration Report. Board discretion was exercised to adjust downward 9,810 deferred shares to zero in 2019 (2018: 2,632).\nExpensing of the ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan\nExpensing value (fair value)\nThe fair value of shares we granted during 2019 under the Employee Share Offer and the Deferred Share Plan, measured as at the date of grant of the shares, is $67.7 million (2018: $80.9 million) based on 2,602,406 shares (2018: 2,774,545) at VWAP of $26.01 (2018: $29.17).\n196\n196\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n31. EMPLOYEE SHARE AND OPTION PLANS (continued)\nANZ SHARE OPTION PLAN\nAllocation\nWe may grant selected employees options/rights which entitle them to acquire fully paid ordinary ANZ shares at a fixed price at the time the options/rights vest. Voting and dividend rights will be attached to the ordinary shares allocated on exercise of the options/rights.\nEach option/right entitles the holder to one ordinary share subject to the terms and conditions imposed on grant. Exercise price of options, determined in accordance with the rules of the plan, is generally based on the VWAP of the shares traded on the ASX in the week leading up to and including the date of grant. For rights, the exercise price is nil.\nRules\nPrior to the exercise of the option/right if ANZ changes its share capital due to a bonus share issue, pro-rata new share issue or reorganisation the following adjustments are required:\nIssue of bonus shares - When the holder exercises their option, they are also entitled to be issued the number of bonus shares they would have been entitled to had they held the underlying shares at the time of the bonus issue;\nPro-rata share offer - We will adjust the exercise price of the option in the manner set out in the ASX Listing Rules; and\nReorganisation - In respect of rights, if there is a bonus issue or reorganisation of ANZ’s share capital, then the Board may adjust the number of rights or the number of underlying shares so that there is no advantage or disadvantage to the holder.\nHolders otherwise have no other entitlements to participate:\nin any new issue of ANZ securities before they exercise their options/rights; or\nin a share issue of a body corporate other than ANZ (such as a subsidiary).\nFor equity grants made after 1 November 2012, any portion of the award which vests may, at the Board’s discretion, be satisfied by a cash equivalent payment rather than shares.\nExpensing\nWe expense the fair value of options/rights on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period and we recognise the expense as a share-based compensation expense with a corresponding increase in equity.\nCessation\nThe provisions that apply if the employee’s employment ends are in section 9.2.3 of the 2019 Remuneration Report.\nDownward adjustment\nANZ’s downward adjustment provisions are detailed in section 6.3 of the 2019 Remuneration Report.\nOption Plans that operated during 2019 and 2018\ni) Performance Rights\nAllocation\nSatisfying vesting\nWe grant performance rights to selected employees as part of ANZ’s incentive plans. Performance rights provide the holder with the right to acquire ANZ shares at nil cost, subject to a three-year vesting period1 and Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance hurdles. Further details on the performance hurdles are in section 6.2.3a of the 2019 Remuneration Report. Any portion of the award of performance rights (that have met the performance hurdles) may be satisfied by a cash equivalent payment rather than shares at the Board’s discretion. All performance rights were satisfied through a share allocation, other than 47,195 performance rights (2018: none) for which Board discretion was exercised.\n2019 and 2018 grants\nDuring the 2019 year, we granted 885,810 performance rights (2018: 1,023,239).\nDownward adjustment\nBoard discretion was exercised to adjust downward 59,012 performance rights to zero in 2019 (2018: none).\n1.

EMPLOYEE SHARE AND OPTION PLANS (continued)\nii) Deferred Share Rights (no performance hurdles)\nAllocation\nDeferred share rights provide the holder with the right to acquire ANZ shares at nil cost after a specified vesting period. We adjust the fair value of rights for the absence of dividends during the restriction period.\nSatisfying vesting\nAny portion of the award of share rights may be satisfied by a cash equivalent payment rather than shares at the Board’s discretion. All share rights were satisfied through a share allocation, other than 68,357 deferred share rights (2018: 108,783) for which Board discretion was exercised.\n2019 and 2018 grants\nDuring the 2019 year, 2,078,427 deferred share rights (no performance hurdles) were granted (2018: 2,546,333).\nDownward adjustment\nBoard discretion was exercised to adjust downward 11,824 deferred share rights to zero in 2019 (2018: 1,638).\nOptions, Deferred Share Rights and Performance Rights on Issue As at 30 October 2019, there were 615 holders of 4,173,045 deferred share rights on issue and 142 holders of 2,486,001 performance rights on issue.\nOptions/Rights Movements This table shows the options/rights over unissued ANZ shares and their related weighted average (WA) exercise prices as at the beginning and end of 2019 and the movements during 2019:\nOpening balance 1 Oct 2018\nOptions/ rights granted\nOptions/ rights forfeited1\nOptions/ rights expired\nOptions/ rights exercised\nClosing balance 30 Sep 2019\nNumber of options/rights\n7,148,573\n2,964,237\n(1,589,109)\n0\n(1,835,163)\n6,688,538\nWA exercise price\n$0.00\n$0.00\n$0.00\n$0.00\n$0.00\n$0.00\nWA closing share price\n$26.66\nWA remaining contractual life\n1.9 years\nWA exercise price of all exercisable options/rights outstanding\n$0.00\nOutstanding exercisable options/rights\n181,581\nThis table shows the options/rights over unissued ANZ shares and their related weighted average exercise prices as at the beginning and end of 2018 and the movements during 2018:\nOpening balance 1 Oct 2017\nOptions/ rights granted\nOptions/ rights forfeited1\nOptions/ rights expired\nOptions/ rights exercised\nClosing balance 30 Sep 2018\nNumber of options/rights\n7,113,784\n3,569,572\n(2,043,209)\n(1,558)\n(1,490,016)\n7,148,573\nWA exercise price\n$0.00\n$0.00\n$0.00\n$0.00\n$0.00\n$0.00\nWA closing share price\n$28.43\nWA remaining contractual life\n2.1 years\nWA exercise price of all exercisable options/rights outstanding\n$0.00\nOutstanding exercisable options/rights\n67,666\n1.

EMPLOYEE SHARE AND OPTION PLANS (continued)\nFair Value Assumptions\nWhen determining the fair value, we apply the standard market techniques for valuation, including Monte Carlo and/or Black Scholes pricing models. We do so in accordance with the requirements of AASB 2 Share-based Payments. The models take into account early exercise of vested equity, non- transferability and internal/external performance hurdles (if any).\nThe table below shows the significant assumptions we used as inputs into our fair value calculation of instruments granted during the period. We present the values as weighted averages, but the specific values we use for each allocation are the ones we use for the fair value calculation.\n2019\n2018\nDeferred share rights\nPerformance rights\nDeferred share rights\nPerformance rights\nExercise price ($)\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\nShare closing price at grant date ($)\n25.83\n25.52\n29.24\n29.21\nExpected volatility of ANZ share price (%)1\n20.0\n20.0\n20.0\n20.0\nEquity term (years)\n2.5\n4.8\n2.4\n5.0\nVesting period (years)\n2.1\n3.0\n2.1\n3.0\nExpected life (years)\n2.1\n3.0\n2.1\n3.0\nExpected dividend yield (%)\n6\n6\n5.75\n5.75\nRisk free interest rate (%)\n1.96\n2.05\n1.65\n1.95\nFair value ($)\n22.87\n9.40\n26.03\n12.24\n1. Expected volatility represents a measure of the amount by which ANZ’s share price is expected to fluctuate over the life of the rights. The measure of volatility used in the model is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the historical share price over a deferred period of time preceding the date of grant. This historical average annualised volatility is then used to estimate a reasonable expected volatility over the expected life of the rights.\nSATISFYING EQUITY AWARDS All shares underpinning equity awards may be purchased on market, reallocated or be newly issued shares, or a combination.\nThe equity we purchased on market during the 2019 financial year (either under the ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan and the ANZ Share Option Plan, or to satisfy options or rights) for all employees amounted to 4,317,094 shares at an average price of $25.99 per share (2018: 3,936,773 shares at an average price of $29.00 per share).\n199\n199\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n32. RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES\nKEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL COMPENSATION\nKey Management Personnel (KMP) are defined as all directors and those executives who report directly to the CEO:\nwith responsibility for the strategic direction and management of a major income generating division; or\nwho control material income and expenses.\nKMP compensation included within total personnel expenses in Note 3 Operating Expenses is as follows:\n2019 $0001\n2018 $0001\nShort-term benefits2\n15,784\n19,497\nPost-employment benefits\n415\n333\nOther long-term benefits\n213\n150\nTermination benefits\n2,112\n454\nShare-based payments\n6,184\n8,910\nTotal\n24,708\n29,344\n1.\nIncludes former disclosed KMPs until the end of their employment.\n2.\nIncludes restatement of prior year amount to include items previously characterised as business related expenses that would be more appropriately be characterised as non-business related. Similar items existed in the prior periods between 2010-2017 which would have increased the short-terms benefits by less than $0.1 million per annum.\nKEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL LOAN TRANSACTIONS\nLoans made to KMP are made in the ordinary course of business and on normal commercial terms and conditions that are no more favourable than those given to other employees or customers, including: the term of the loan, security required and the interest rate. No amounts have been written off during the period, or individual provision raised in respect of these balances. The aggregate of loans (including credit card balances) made, guaranteed or secured, and undrawn facilities to KMP including their related parties, were as follows:\n2019 $000\n2018 $000\nLoans advanced1,2\n26,862\n23,675\nUndrawn facilities1\n513\n286\nInterest charged3\n739\n932\n1. Balances are as at the balance sheet date (for KMP in office at balance sheet date) or at the date of cessation of former KMP. 2. Prior period has been restated to include credit card balances and exclude an available for redraw component of loan balances previously included within loans advanced. 3. Interest charged is for all KMP’s during the period.\nKEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL HOLDINGS OF ANZ SECURITIES\nKMP, including their related parties, held subordinated debt, shares, share rights and options over shares in the Company directly, indirectly or beneficially as shown below:\n2019 Number1\n2018 Number1\nShares, options and rights\n1,892,754\n2,293,271\nSubordinated debt\n11,802\n13,152\n1.

RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES (continued)\nOTHER TRANSACTIONS OF KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND THEIR RELATED PARTIES\nThe aggregate of deposits of KMP and their related parties with the Group were $60 million (2018: $56 million).\nOther transactions with KMP and their related parties included amounts paid to the Group in respect of insurance premiums, investment management service fees, brokerage and bank fees and charges. The Group has reimbursed KMP for the costs incurred for secretarial services associated with the performance of their duties. These transactions are conducted on normal commercial terms and conditions no more favourable than those given to other employees or customers.\nIn November 2010, a subsidiary of ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited (ANZ NZ) purchased a residential property in New Zealand for NZ$7.55 million. The property was leased to the then ANZ NZ Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mr David Hisco, as part of a relocation package arrangement.\nOn 31 March 2017, the property was sold to Mr David Hisco’s wife for NZ$6.9 million. At that time, Mr Hisco was the CEO of ANZ NZ and a member of Key Management Personnel.\nANZ NZ obtained two independent valuations of the property, one of which was not considered for a number of reasons, including that it did not comply with valuation standards. ANZ NZ then obtained a further independent valuation and the sale price was determined as the midpoint of these two independent valuations, less an amount reflecting part of the estimated sale costs that would have otherwise been incurred.\nConsistent with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s requirements on ANZ NZ concerning independence, the sale of the property was overseen by ANZ NZ.\nThis transaction was not separately disclosed in the Group’s or ANZ NZ’s 2017 financial statements. ASIC made enquiries of ANZ concerning disclosure of this matter in the 2017 financial statements. ANZ also acknowledges the determination of the Financial Markets Authority (New Zealand) that ANZ NZ should have disclosed the March 2017 sale as a related party transaction in its 2017 financial statements.\nASSOCIATES\nWe disclose significant associates in Note 26 Investments in Associates. During the course of the financial year, transactions conducted with all associates were on terms equivalent to those made on an arm’s length basis:\n2019 $000\n2018 $000\nAmounts receivable from associates\n664\n35,083\nAmounts payable to associates\n697\n1,504\nInterest income from associates\n93\n1,772\nOther expenses paid to associates\n11,561\n15,296\nDividend income from associates\n50,014\n51,643\nThere have been no material guarantees given or received.

COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS\nCREDIT RELATED COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\nContract amount of:\nUndrawn facilities\n209,340\n202,531\nGuarantees and letters of credit\n22,339\n18,441\nPerformance related contingencies\n22,112\n24,136\nTotal\n253,791\n245,108\nUNDRAWN FACILITIES The majority of undrawn facilities are subject to customers maintaining specific credit and other requirements or conditions. Many of these facilities are expected to be only partially used, and others may never be used at all. As such, the total of the nominal principal amounts is not necessarily representative of future liquidity risks or future cash requirements. Based on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay, the total undrawn facilities of 209,341 million (2018: $202,531 million) mature within 12 months.\nGUARANTEES, LETTERS OF CREDIT AND PERFORMANCE RELATED CONTINGENCIES Guarantees, letters of credit and performance related contingencies relate to transactions that the Group has entered into as principal – including: guarantees, standby letters of credit and documentary letters of credit.\nDocumentary letters of credit involve the Group issuing letters of credit guaranteeing payment in favour of an exporter. They are secured against an underlying shipment of goods or backed by a confirmatory letter of credit from another bank.\nPerformance related contingencies are liabilities that oblige the Group to make payments to a third party if the customer fails to fulfil its non-monetary obligations under the contract.\nTo reflect the risk associated with these transactions, we apply the same credit origination, portfolio management and collateral requirements that we apply to loans. The contract amount represents the maximum potential amount that we could lose if the counterparty fails to meet its financial obligations. As the facilities may expire without being drawn upon, the notional amounts do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements. Based on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay, the total guarantees and letters of credit of $22,339 million (2018: $18,441 million) and total performance related contingencies of $22,112 million (2018: $24,136 million) mature within 12 months.\nPROPERTY RELATED COMMITMENTS\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\nLease rentals\nLand and buildings\n1,586\n1,431\nFurniture and equipment\n70\n205\nTotal lease rental commitments1\n1,656\n1,636\nDue within 1 year\n320\n371\nDue later than 1 year but not later than 5 years\n847\n832\nDue later than 5 years\n489\n433\nTotal lease rental commitments1\n1,656\n1,636\n1.

COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS (continued)\nOTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES As at 30 September 2019, the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of the matters outlined below. Where relevant, expert legal advice has been obtained and, in the light of such advice, provisions (refer to note 21) and/or disclosures as deemed appropriate have been made. In some instances we have not disclosed the estimated financial impact of the individual items either because it is not practicable to do so or because such disclosure may prejudice the interests of the Group.\nREGULATORY AND CUSTOMER EXPOSURES In recent years there has been an increase in the number of matters on which the Group engages with its regulators. There have also been significant increases in the nature and scale of regulatory investigations and reviews, civil and criminal enforcement actions (whether by court action or otherwise), formal and informal inquiries, regulatory supervisory activities and the quantum of fines issued by regulators, particularly against financial institutions both in Australia and globally. The Group has received various notices and requests for information from its regulators as part of both industry-wide and Group-specific reviews and has also made disclosures to its regulators at its own instigation. The nature of these interactions can be wide ranging and, for example, currently include a range of matters including responsible lending practices, product suitability and distribution, interest and fees and the entitlement to charge them, customer remediation, wealth advice, insurance distribution, pricing, competition, conduct in financial markets and financial transactions, capital market transactions, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations, reporting and disclosure obligations and product disclosure documentation. There may be exposures to customers which are additional to any regulatory exposures. These could include class actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities. The outcomes and total costs associated with such reviews and possible exposures remain uncertain.\nBANK FEES LITIGATION AND PERIODICAL PAYMENT REMEDIATION AND ASIC ACTION A litigation funder commenced a class action against the Company in 2010, followed by a second similar class action in March 2013. The applicants contended that certain exception fees (honour, dishonour and non-payment fees on transaction accounts and late payment and over-limit fees on credit cards) were unenforceable penalties and that various of the fees were also unenforceable under statutory provisions governing unconscionable conduct, unfair contract terms and unjust transactions. The claims in the March 2013 class action failed and have been dismissed.\nThe original claims in the 2010 class action have been dismissed. In 2017, a new claim was added to the 2010 class action, in relation to the Company’s entitlement to charge certain periodical payment non-payment fees. Part of the class of customers had already received remediation payments from the Company. An agreement to settle the claim was reached in December 2018. The settlement is subject to court approval.\nIn July 2019, ASIC commenced civil penalty proceedings against the Company in relation to the charging of fees for periodical payments in certain circumstances between August 2003 and February 2016. ASIC seeks civil penalties in respect of alleged false or misleading representations and unconscionable conduct. ASIC also alleges that the Company engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct and breached certain statutory obligations as a financial services licensee. The matter is at an early stage. The outcomes and total costs remain uncertain. The Company is defending the allegations.\nBENCHMARK/RATE ACTIONS In July and August 2016, class action complaints were brought in the United States District Court against local and international banks, including the Company – one action relating to the bank bill swap rate (BBSW), and one action relating to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR) and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate (SOR). The class actions are expressed to apply to persons and entities that engaged in US-based transactions in financial instruments that were priced, benchmarked, and/or settled based on BBSW or SIBOR. The claimants seek damages or compensation in amounts not specified, and allege that the defendant banks, including the Company, violated US anti-trust laws and (in the BBSW case only) anti-racketeering laws, the Commodity Exchange Act, and unjust enrichment principles. The Company is defending the proceedings. The matters are at an early stage.\nIn February 2017, the South African Competition Commission commenced proceedings against local and international banks including the Company alleging breaches of the cartel provisions of the South African Competition Act in respect of trading in the South African rand. The potential civil penalty or other financial impact is uncertain. The matter is at an early stage.\nCAPITAL RAISING ACTIONS In June 2018, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions commenced criminal proceedings against the Company and a senior employee alleging that they were knowingly concerned in cartel conduct by the joint lead managers of the Company’s August 2015 underwritten institutional equity placement of approximately 80.8 million ordinary shares. The matter is at an early stage. The Company and its senior employee are defending the allegations.\nIn September 2018, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) commenced civil penalty proceedings against the Company alleging failure to comply with continuous disclosure obligations in connection with the Company’s August 2015 underwritten institutional equity placement. ASIC alleges the Company should have advised the market that the joint lead managers took up approximately 25.5 million ordinary shares of the placement. The matter is at an early stage. The Company is defending the allegations.\nFRANCHISEE LITIGATION In February 2018, two related class actions were brought against the Company alleging breaches of contract and unconscionable conduct in relation to lending to 7-Eleven franchisees. An agreement to settle the claims against the Company was reached in March 2019. The settlement is subject to court approval.\n203\n203\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n33. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS (continued)\nROYAL COMMISSION The Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry released its final report on 4 February 2019. The findings and recommendations of the Commission are resulting in additional costs and may lead to further exposures, including exposures associated with further regulator activity or potential customer exposures such as class actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities. The outcomes and total costs associated with these possible exposures remain uncertain.\nSECURITY RECOVERY ACTIONS Various claims have been made or are anticipated, arising from security recovery actions taken to resolve impaired assets. These claims will be defended.\nWARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES The Group has provided warranties, indemnities and other commitments in favour of the purchaser and other persons in connection with various disposals of businesses and assets and other transactions, covering a range of matters and risks. It is exposed to potential claims under those warranties, indemnities and commitments.\nCLEARING AND SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS Certain group companies have a commitment to comply with rules governing various clearing and settlement arrangements which could result in a credit risk exposure and loss if another member institution fails to settle its payment clearing activities. The Group’s potential exposure arising from these arrangements is unquantifiable in advance.\nCertain group companies hold memberships of central clearing houses, including ASX Clear (Futures), London Clearing House (LCH) SwapClear and RepoClear, Korea Exchange (KRX), Hong Kong Exchange (HKEX), Clearing Corporation of India and the Shanghai Clearing House. These memberships allow the relevant group company to centrally clear derivative instruments in line with cross-border regulatory requirements. Common to all of these memberships is the requirement for the relevant group company to make default fund contributions. In the event of a default by another member, the relevant group company could potentially be required to commit additional default fund contributions which are unquantifiable in advance.\nPARENT ENTITY GUARANTEES The Company has issued letters of comfort and guarantees in respect of certain subsidiaries in the normal course of business. Under these letters and guarantees, the Company undertakes to ensure that those subsidiaries continue to meet their financial obligations, subject to certain conditions including that the entity remains a controlled entity of the Company.\nSALE OF GRINDLAYS BUSINESSES On 31 July 2000, the Company completed the sale to Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) of ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited and the private banking business of ANZ in the United Kingdom and Jersey, together with ANZ Grindlays (Jersey) Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries, for USD1.3 billion in cash. The Company provided warranties and certain indemnities relating to those businesses and, where it was anticipated that payments would be likely under the warranties or indemnities, made provisions to cover the anticipated liabilities. The issue below has not adversely impacted the reported results. All settlements and penalties to date have been covered within existing provisions.\nIn 1991 certain amounts were transferred from non-convertible Indian Rupee accounts maintained with Grindlays in India. These transactions may not have complied with the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973. Grindlays, on its own initiative, brought these transactions to the attention of the Reserve Bank of India. The Indian authorities served notices on Grindlays and certain of its officers in India and civil penalties have been imposed which are the subject of appeals. Criminal prosecutions are pending and will be defended. The amounts in issue are not material.\nCONTINGENT ASSETS NATIONAL HOUSING BANK The Company is pursuing recovery of the proceeds of certain disputed cheques which were credited to the account of a former Grindlays customer in the early 1990s.\nThe disputed cheques were drawn on the National Housing Bank (NHB) in India. Proceedings between Grindlays and NHB concerning the proceeds of the cheques were resolved in early 2002.\nRecovery is now being pursued from the estate of the Grindlays customer who received the cheque proceeds. Any amounts recovered are to be shared between the Company and NHB.\n204\n204\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n34.

The nature of the non-audit services includes general market and regulatory insights, training, controls related assessments, methodology and procedural reviews. Further details are provided in the Directors’ Report. Inclusive of goods and services tax.\n3.\nThe Group’s Policy allows KPMG Australia or any of its related practices to provide assurance and other audit-related services that, while outside the scope of the statutory audit, are consistent with the role of an external auditor. These include regulatory and prudential reviews requested by regulators such as APRA. Any other services that are not audit or audit-related services are non-audit services. The Policy allows certain non-audit services to be provided where the service would not contravene auditor independence requirements. KPMG Australia or any of its related practices may not provide services that are perceived to be in conflict with the role of the external auditor or breach auditor independence. These include consulting advice and subcontracting of operational activities normally undertaken by management, and engagements where the external auditor may ultimately be required to express an opinion on its own work.\n205\n205\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n35.

The Group adopted AASB 15 in this reporting period with comparatives restated. The impact of this policy change on the reported 30 September 2018 balance sheet was an increase in Other assets of $32 million, an increase in Deferred tax liabilities of $10 million and an increase in Retained earnings of $22 million, reflecting revenue that qualifies for upfront recognition under AASB 15 but was not previously recognised under AASB 118.\n3. Upon adoption of AASB 15, certain liabilities associated with credit card loyalty programs have been reclassified from Other provisions to Payables and other liabilities.\nIn addition to the balance sheet impact above, upon adoption of AASB 15 certain items previously netted are now presented gross in operating income and operating expenses. This increased total operating income and total operating expenses by $128 million for the 2019 financial year. Comparative information has been restated which increased total operating income and total operating expenses by $153 million for the 2018 financial year.\nImpact of the transition to AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9)\nALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES\nThe table below reconciles the closing provisions for credit impairment of financial assets determined in accordance with AASB 139 Finanicial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and provisions for credit impairment of loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts determined in accordance with AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets as at 30 September 2018, and the opening allowance for expected credit losses determined in accordance with AASB 9 as at 1 October 2018.\nAs at 30 Sep 18 Provision for credit impairment under AASB 139 or AASB 137 $m\nIncremental allowance for ECL under AASB 9 $m\nAs at 1 Oct 18\nAllowance for ECL under AASB 9 $m\nLoans and advances - at amortised cost\n2,917\n647\n3,564\nInvestment securities - debt securities at amortised cost Off-balance sheet commitments - undrawn and contingent facilities1\n\n526\n11\n155\n11\n681\nTotal provisions for credit impairment\n3,443\n813\n4,256\nLoss allowances recognised in other comprehensive income Investment securities - debt securities at FVOCI2\n\n14\n14\nTotal loss allowance recognised in other comprehensive income\n\n14\n14\n1.

IMPACT OF ADOPTION OF NEW STANDARDS AND OTHER CHANGES (continued)\nREFERENCE\n1. On initial application of AASB 9, a portfolio of bonds with a fair value of $1,000 million was transferred from Trading securities to Investment securities - debt securities at FVOCI as the applicable business model was held to collect and sell. Cumulative fair value gains/(losses) on this portfolio of $2 million (after tax) were transferred from Retained earnings to the FVOCI reserve. Additionally, the reclassification resulted in a reduction in deferred tax assets and current tax liabilities of $1 million. The Available-for-sale classification is no longer applicable under AASB 9. Accordingly, on transition:\n$69,938 million of Available-for-sale debt instruments were reclassified to Investment securities – debt securities at FVOCI due to the business model being held to collect and sell. There was no re-measurement impact associated with this reclassification;\n$3,252 million of Available-for-sale debt instruments were reclassified to Investment securities – debt securities at amortised cost due to the business model being held to collect at 1 October 2018. This reclassification resulted in re-measurement of a $2 million increase to the carrying amount arising from reversal of the previous available-for-sale revaluation reserve. Additionally, a deferred tax asset of $1 million associated with the previous available-for-sale revaluation was reversed;\nthe Group made irrevocable elections to designate $1,087 million of non-traded Available-for-sale equity securities as Investment securities - equity securities at FVOCI; and\n$7 million of Available-for-sale equity securities were reclassified to Trading securities and the related reserve balance of $1 million was reclassified to Retained earnings.\n3.\nCertain loans with contractual cash flow characteristics that are not solely payments of principal and interest were reclassified from Net loans and advances at amortised cost to Net Loans and advances at FVTPL. The loans had an amortised cost carrying amount of $224 million and a fair value of $201 million at 30 September 2018. The associated re-measurement of $23 million was recognised in Retained earnings offset by a decrease in current tax liabilities of $7 million. In addition, one of the loans was previously in a fair value hedge relationship which was discontinued effective 1 October 2018. Accordingly, changes in the fair value due to changes in the hedged risk which were previously recognised as a reduction to the carrying value of the loan amounting to $15 million were written back to Retained earnings offset by an increase in current tax liabilities of $4 million.\n4.\nThe Group elected to designate certain financial liabilities (bonds included within Debt issuances) as measured at FVTPL effective from 1 October 2018 to reduce an accounting mismatch. The bonds had an amortised cost carrying amount of $879 million and a fair value of $824 million at 30 September 2018. The difference of $55 million (comprising a $109 million decrease in fair value before own credit, offset by a $54 million increase in fair value attributable to own credit) offset by a net tax impact of $17 million (increase in deferred tax asset of $17 million and an increase in current tax liability of $34 million) was recognised in Retained earnings.\n5.\nThe Group recognised a decrease of $65 million to the carrying value of Investments in associates with a corresponding decrease to Retained earnings reflecting the Group’s share of the estimated initial application impact of IFRS 9 (the international equivalent of AASB 9).\n6.\nThe initial application of the expected credit loss requirements of AASB 9, resulted in increases in allowances for credit impairment attributable to the following:\nOn-balance sheet loans and advances of $647 million reflected in Net loans and advances at amortised cost;\nDebt securities measured at amortised cost of $11 million reflected in Investment securities – debt securities at amortised cost; and\nOff-balance sheet credit related commitments of $155 million reflected in Other provisions.\nThe total impact of $813 million was recognised as a reduction to Retained earnings, offset by an increase of $234 million related to deferred tax. Additionally, loss allowances of $10 million (after-tax) attributable to Investment Securities – debt securities at FVOCI have been recognised in Reserves with a corresponding adjustment to Retained earnings. The debt securities remain at fair value on the face of the Balance Sheet.\n7. On initial application of AASB 9, a portfolio of Negotiable Certificates of Deposit with a carrying amount of $2,906 million was reclassified from Net loans and advances at amortised cost to Investment Securities – debt securities at amortised cost. There was no re-measurement impact associated with this reclassification.\n8. On initial application of AASB 9, loans with a carrying amount and fair value of $1,340 million that were in the process of being syndicated were reclassified from Net loans and advances at amortised cost to Net Loans and advances at FVTPL on the basis that the applicable business model is held-to-sell. There was no re-measurement impact associated with this reclassification.\n208\n208\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n36. EVENTS SINCE THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR\nOn 17 October the Group announced it had agreed a revised price for the sale of its OnePath P&I business and ADGs to IOOF of $850 million, being a $125 million reduction from the original sale price of $975 million announced in October 2017. The new price of $850 million includes approximately $25 million that ANZ has already received for the sale of ADGs in October 2018. The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements. Subject to APRA approval, the Group expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. The impact of the reduction in price has been reflected in the 2019 financial results.\nOther than the matter above, there have been no significant events from 30 September 2019 to the date of signing this report.\n209\n209\n210\nCONSOLIDATED GROUP DIRECTORS’ DECLARATION\nDirectors’ Declaration\nThe Directors of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited declare that:\na)\nin the Directors’ opinion, the financial statements and notes of the Consolidated Entity are in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including:\ni)\nsection 296, that they comply with the Australian Accounting Standards and any further requirements of the Corporations Regulations 2001; and\nii)\nsection 297, that they give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Consolidated Entity as at 30 September 2019 and of its performance for the year ended on that date;\nb) the notes to the financial statements of the Consolidated Entity include a statement that the financial statements and notes of the Consolidated\nEntity comply with International Financial Reporting Standards;\nc)\nthe Directors have been given the declarations required by section 295A of the Corporations Act 2001; and\nd)\nin the Directors’ opinion, there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Company will be able to pay its debts as and when they become due and payable.\nSigned in accordance with a resolution of the Directors.\nDavid M Gonski, AC Chairman\nShayne C Elliott Director\n30 October 2019\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\n210\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT\nTO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND BANKING GROUP LIMITED\nREPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL REPORT\nOPINION\nWe have audited the Financial Report of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (the Company) and the entities it controlled at the year end and from time to time during the financial year (together, the Group).\nIn our opinion, the accompanying Financial Report of the Group is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including:\ngiving a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position as at 30 September 2019 and of its financial performance for the year ended on that date; and\ncomplying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001.\nThe Financial Report comprises the:\nconsolidated statement of financial position as at 30 September 2019;\nconsolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity, and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended;\nnotes 1 to 36 including a summary of significant accounting policies; and\nDirectors’ Declaration.\nBASIS FOR OPINION\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report section of our report.\nWe are independent of the Group in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the Financial Report in Australia. We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.\nKEY AUDIT MATTERS\nThe Key Audit Matters we identified are:\nAllowance for expected credit losses;\nValuation of Financial Instruments held at Fair Value;\nProvisions for Customer Remediation;\nAccounting for Divestments; and\nIT Systems and Controls.\nKey Audit Matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Report of the current period.\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n211\n211\nANZ 2018 ANNUAL REPORT\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (continued)\nKEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued)\nALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES ($4,190M)\nRefer to the critical accounting estimates and judgements disclosures in relation to the allowance for expected credit losses in Note 13 to the Financial Report.\nThe Key Audit Matter AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9) was adopted by the Group on 1 October 2018. This is a key audit matter due to the significance of the loans and advances balance to the financial statements and the inherent complexity of the Group’s Expected Credit Loss (ECL) models (ECL models) used to measure ECL allowances. This new and complex accounting standard requires the Group to recognise ECLs on its loans and advances and off-balance sheet positions; the Group developed new models which are reliant on data as well as a number of estimates including the impact of multiple economic scenarios and other assumptions such as defining a significant increase in credit risk (SICR). This involves significant judgement and estimates and takes into account forward looking information reflecting potential future economic events.\nAASB 9 requires the Group to measure ECLs on a forward-looking basis reflecting a range of future economic conditions, including key forward- looking assumptions such as forecast GDP and unemployment levels. Post-model adjustments to the ECL results are also made by the Group to address known ECL model limitations or emerging trends in the loan portfolios. We exercise significant judgement in challenging the economic scenarios used and the judgemental overlays the Group applied to the ECL results.\nThe criteria selected to identify a SICR, such as a decrease in customer credit rating (CCR), are key areas of judgement within the Group’s ECL methodology as these criteria determine if a forward-looking 12 month or lifetime allowance is recorded.\nSeparate from the ECL calculation, allowances for individually assessed loans exceeding specific thresholds are individually assessed by the Group. These specific allowances are established based on the expected future cash repayments and estimated proceeds from the value of the collateral held by the Group in respect of the loans.\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit Our audit procedures for the allowance for ECL and disclosures for the year ended 30 September 2019 included assessing the Group’s significant accounting policies against the requirements of the accounting standard. Additionally our procedures covered:\nWe tested key controls in relation to:\nThe Group’s ECL model governance and validation processes;\nThe Group’s assessment and approval of the forward looking macroeconomic assumptions and scenario weightings through challenge applied by the Group’s internal governance processes; and\nReconciliation of the data used in the ECL calculation process to gross balances recorded within the general ledger as well as source systems.\nTesting the key controls over counterparty risk grading for wholesale loans (larger customer exposures are monitored individually). We tested the approval of new lending facilities against the Group’s lending policies, and controls over the monitoring of counterparty credit quality. This included testing controls over the identification of exposures showing signs of stress, either due to internal factors specific to the counterparty or external macroeconomic factors, and testing the timeliness of and the accuracy of counterparty risk assessments and risk grading against the requirements of the Group’s lending policies and regulatory requirements; and\nFor retail loans, testing controls over the systems which record lending arrears, group exposures into delinquency buckets, and re-calculate individual allowances. We tested automated calculation and change management controls and evaluated the Group’s oversight of the portfolios, with a focus on controls over delinquency monitoring. We tested a sample of the level of allowances held against different loan products based on the delinquency profile and challenged assumptions made in respect of expected recoveries, including from collateral held.\nWe also tested relevant General Information Technology Controls (GITCs) over the key IT applications used by the Group in measuring ECL allowances as detailed in the IT Systems and Controls key audit matter below.\nIn addition to controls testing, our procedures included:\nPerforming credit assessments of a sample of wholesale loans controlled by the Group’s specialist workout and recovery team assessed as higher risk or impaired, and a sample of other loans, focusing on larger exposures assessed by the Group as showing signs of deterioration, or in areas of emerging risk (assessed against external market conditions). We challenged the Group’s risk grading of the loan, assessment of loan recoverability, valuation of security and the impact on the credit allowance. To do this, we used the information on the Group’s loan file, understood the facts and circumstances of the case with the loan officer, and performed our own assessment of recoverability. Exercising our judgement, our procedures included using our understanding of relevant industries and the macroeconomic environment and comparing data and assumptions used by the Group in recoverability assessments to externally sourced evidence, such as commodity prices, publicly available audited financial statements and comparable external valuations of collateral held. Where relevant we assessed the forecast timing of future cash flows in the context of supporting valuations and approved business plans and challenged key assumptions implicit in the valuations;\nObtaining an understanding of the Group’s processes to determine ECL allowances, evaluating the Group’s ECL model methodologies against established market practices and criteria in the accounting standards;\n212\n212\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nKEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued)\nWorking with KPMG Risk Consulting specialists, we assessed the accuracy of the Group’s ECL model predictions by re-performing, for a sample of loans, the ECL allowance and comparing this to the amount recorded by the Group;\nWorking with KPMG Economic specialists, we challenged the Group’s forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions and scenarios incorporated in the Group’s ECL models. We compared the Group’s forecast GDP and unemployment rates to relevant publicly available macro-economic information, and considered other known variables and information obtained through our other audit procedures to identify contradictory indicators;\nTesting the implementation of the Group’s SICR methodology by re-performing the staging calculation for a sample of loans and comparing our expectation to actual staging applied on an individual account level, taking into consideration movements in CCR; and\nAssessing the accuracy of the data used in the ECL models by confirming a sample of data fields such as account balance and CCR to relevant source systems.\nWe also challenged key assumptions in the components of the Group’s post-model adjustments to the ECL allowance balance. This included:\nEvaluating underlying data used in concentration risk and economic cycle allowances by comparing underlying portfolio characteristics to recent loss experience, current market conditions and specific risks inherent in the Group’s loan portfolios;\nAssessing the requirement for other additional allowances considering the Group’s ECL model and data deficiencies identified by the Group’s ECL model validation processes, and\nAssessing the completeness of additional allowance overlays by checking the consistency of risks we identified in the portfolios against the Group’s assessment.\nAASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Assessing the appropriateness of the Group’s disclosures in the financial report using our understanding obtained from our testing against the requirements of the accounting standard.\nVALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD AT FAIR VALUE: - ASSETS HELD AT FAIR VALUE $243,888M - LIABILITIES HELD AT FAIR VALUE $130,346M\nRefer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures of fair values in Note 17 to the Financial Report.\nThe Key Audit Matter Financial instruments held at fair value on the Group’s balance sheet include investment securities, trading securities, derivative assets and liabilities, certain debt securities, and other assets and liabilities designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income. The instruments are mainly risk management products sold to customers and used by the Group to manage its own interest rate and foreign exchange risk.\nThe valuation of financial instruments held at fair value is considered a Key Audit Matter as:\nFinancial instruments held at fair value are significant (25% of assets and 14% of liabilities);\nThe significant volume and range of products transacted, in a number of international locations, increases the risk of inconsistencies in transaction management processes that could lead to inaccurate valuation;\nDetermining the fair value of trading securities and derivatives involves a significant level of judgement by the Group, increasing the risk of error, and adding complexity to our audit. The level of judgement increases where internal models, as opposed to quoted market prices, are used to determine fair value of an instrument, or where inputs to the internal models, such as discount rates and measures of volatility, are not observable; or where there are a greater number of variables, including trade economic details and modelling assumptions, which feed into the internal models; and\nThe valuation of certain derivatives held by the Group is sensitive to inputs including funding rates, probabilities of default loss given default. Both funding and credit risk are incorporated within the valuation of certain derivative instruments. This increased our audit effort in this area and necessitated the involvement of valuation specialists.\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit Our audit procedures for the valuation of financial instruments held at fair value included:\nTesting access rights and change management controls for key valuation systems;\nTesting interface controls, notably the completeness and accuracy of data transfers between transaction processing systems, key systems used to generate valuations and any related valuation adjustments, and the Group’s market risk management and finance systems to identify inconsistencies in transaction management and valuation processes across products and locations;\nTesting the governance and approval controls, such as management review and approval of the valuation models, and approval of new products against policies and procedures;\n213\n213\nANZ 2018 ANNUAL REPORT\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (continued)\nKEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued)\nTesting the front office management review and approval of the daily financial instrument trading profit and loss reconciliations prepared by the\nGroup’s independent markets and treasury control;\nTesting the management review and approval of model construction and validation, aimed at assessing the validity and robustness of underlying valuation models; and\nTesting the Group’s data validation controls, such as those over key inputs in generating the fair value to market data where fair values were determined by front office teams.\nWe carried out testing over the valuation of financial instruments with both observable and unobservable inputs. Our specific testing involved valuation specialists and included:\nRe-performing the valuation of ‘level 1’ and ‘level 2’ investment securities and trading securities, which are primarily government, semi- government and corporate debt securities, by comparing the observable inputs, including quoted prices, to independently sourced market data;\nUsing independent models, re-calculating the valuation of a sample, across locations, of derivative assets and liabilities where the fair value was determined using observable inputs. This included comparing a sample of observable inputs used in the Group’s derivative valuations to independently-sourced market data, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and volatilities;\nWhere the fair value of derivatives and other financial assets and liabilities were determined using unobservable inputs (‘level 3’ instruments), challenging the Group’s valuation model by testing the key inputs used to comparable data in the market, including the use of proxy instruments and available alternatives. We compared the Group’s valuation methodology to industry practice and the criteria in the accounting standards; and\nEvaluating the appropriateness of the Group’s valuation methodology for derivative financial instruments, having regard to current and emerging derivative valuation practices across a range of peer institutions, and against the required criteria in the accounting standards. We tested adjustments made to valuations, particularly funding and credit valuation adjustments on un-collateralised derivatives. In particular, for a sample of individual counterparties, across locations, we tested key inputs to the credit valuation adjustment calculation, including the probability of default, against observable market data. Where proxies were used, we assessed the proxy against available alternatives, across a number of locations.\nPROVISION FOR CUSTOMER REMEDIATION ($1,139M) Refer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures in Notes 21 and 33 to the Financial Report.\nThe Key Audit Matter The Group has assessed the need to recognise provisions in relation to certain customer remediation activities arising from both internal and external investigations, and reviews. This includes provisions for expected refunds to customers, remediation project costs and related customer and regulatory claims, penalties, and litigation outcomes.\nThe provision for customer remediation activities is a Key Audit Matter due to the number of investigations, the quantum of amounts involved, and the judgements required by us in assessing the Group’s determination of:\nThe existence of a present legal or constructive obligation arising from a past event using the conditions of the event against the criteria in the accounting standards;\nReliable estimates of the amounts which may be paid arising from investigations, including estimates of related costs and regulatory penalties; and\nThe potential for legal proceedings, further investigations, and reviews from its regulators leading to a wider range of estimation outcomes for us to consider.\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit Our audit procedures for customer remediation provisions included:\nObtaining an understanding of the Group’s processes for identifying and assessing the potential impact of the investigations into customer remediation payments, related project costs and legal proceedings associated with compliance matters, investigations and reviews from its regulators;\nEnquiring with the Group regarding ongoing legal, and regulatory matters, and investigation into other remediation activities;\nEnquiring with external legal counsel;\nReading the minutes and other relevant documentation of the Group’s Board of Directors, Board Committees, various management committees, and attending the Group’s Audit and Risk Committee meetings;\nInspecting correspondence with relevant regulatory bodies;\nFor a sample of individual exposures, assessing the basis for recognition and measurement of a provision and associated costs against the requirements of the accounting standards. We did this by understanding and challenging the provisioning methodologies and underlying assumptions;\n214\n214\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nKEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued)\nTesting completeness by evaluating where exposures may have arisen based upon our knowledge and experience of broader industry matters, the Group's documentation and the current regulatory environment. We also checked these features of these exposures against the criteria defining a provision or a contingency in the accounting standards;\nAssessing the appropriateness of the Group’s conclusions against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards where estimates were unable to be reliably made for a provision to be recognised; and\nEvaluating the related disclosures against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\nDIVESTMENT OF WEALTH AUSTRALIA\nRefer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures in Notes 1 and 29 to the Financial Report.\nThe Key Audit Matter On 17 October 2017, the Group announced the sale of its OnePath Pensions and Investments (OnePath P&I) business and Aligned Dealer Groups (ADGs) business to IOOF Holdings Limited (IOOF). The sale of the ADGs business completed on 1 October 2018. On 17 October 2019, the Group announced it had revised its contract terms with IOOF and, subject to APRA approval, the Group expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. On 12 December 2017, the Group announced the sale of its Life Insurance business to Zurich Financial Services Australia Limited (together, the Divestment Businesses). The transaction completed on 31 May 2019 and final adjustments to sale proceeds are subject to finalization of a post completion net asset review. These businesses were part of the Wealth Australia operating segment. The financial results of the Divestment Businesses are presented as discontinued operations, and the associated assets and liabilities of OnePath P&I continues to be classified as held for sale at balance date.\nThe divestments are considered a Key Audit Matter due to the:\nsignificance of the Divestment Businesses to the Group;\njudgement applied by the Group in the measurement of the Divestment Businesses using the requirements accounting standards and the terms and conditions of the divestments;\njudgement is applied by the Group when assessing events that occur after the reporting date but before the financial statements are authorized for issue; and\njudgement applied by the Group in assessing the probability of the divestments against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards at 30 September 2019.\nWe focused on the areas where judgement exists in the measurement of the discontinued operations, including the:\nallocation of goodwill between the Divestment Businesses;\nestimation of costs required to complete the divestments including costs associated with separating these businesses from the Group;\nsubsequent re-measurement adjustments of the Divestment Businesses;\nconsideration of adjusting and non-adjusting subsequent events relating to the Divestment Businesses; and\ntaxation implications of the divestments, potentially having a significant impact on the loss on sale and requiring specialist knowledge.\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit Our audit procedures in relation to the Divestment Businesses included:\nReading the relevant transaction documents to understand the terms and conditions of the divestments;\nAssessing the criteria for the Divestment Businesses to be recognised and measured as held for sale against the criteria in the accounting standards at balance sheet date;\nEvaluating the substance of the divestments using the terms and conditions of the transaction documents against the criteria for discontinued operations in the accounting standards;\nEvaluating the Group’s controls for measurement of the divestments held for sale. This included the Steering Committee review and approval of costs associated with separating the divestments from the Group;\nAssessing, on a sample basis, the identification of assets and liabilities disposed by comparing to transaction documents and underlying financial records at balance date;\nChecking the consideration for the divestments to the transaction documents and underlying financial records;\nAssessing the identification, basis for recognition, and treatment of a sample of costs associated with separating the divestments from the Group for compliance with the accounting standards;\nComparing the quantum of the costs associated with separating the divestments from the Group to similar transactions within the market;\nUsing our tax specialists, we evaluated the associated tax implications against the requirements of the tax legislation;\nEvaluating the methodology applied by the Group to allocate goodwill between the Divestment Businesses based on our knowledge of the businesses and the requirements of the accounting standards;\n215\n215\nANZ 2018 ANNUAL REPORT\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (continued)\nKEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued)\nChecking the Group’s calculations of loss on sale of each of the divestments and any subsequent re-measurement adjustments;\nAssessing events that occur after the reporting date but before the financial statements were authorised for issue; and\nAssessing the disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of the accounting standards.\nIT SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS\nThe Key Audit Matter As a major Australian bank, the group’s businesses utilise a large number of complex, interdependent Information Technology (IT) systems to process and record a high volume of transactions. Controls over access and changes to IT systems are critical to the recording of financial information and the preparation of a financial report which provides a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position and performance. The IT systems and controls, as they impact the financial recording and reporting of transactions, is a key audit matter and our audit approach could significantly differ depending on the effective operation of the Group’s IT controls. KPMG IT specialists were used throughout the engagement as a core part of our audit team.\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit We tested the technology control environment for key IT applications (systems) used in processing significant transactions and recording balances in the general ledger. We also tested automated controls embedded within these systems which support the effective operation of technology-enabled business processes. Our audit procedures included:\nAssessing the governance and higher-level controls in place across the IT Environment, including the approach to Group policy design, review and awareness, and IT Risk Management practices.\nDesign and operating effectiveness testing of controls across the User Access Management Lifecycle, including how users are on-boarded, reviewed, and removed on a timely basis from critical IT applications and supporting infrastructure. We also looked at how privileged roles and functions are managed across each IT Application and the supporting infrastructure.\nDesign and operating effectiveness testing of controls in place to enable Change Management including how changes are initiated, documented, approved, tested and authorised prior to migration into the production environment of critical IT Applications. We also assessed the appropriateness of users with access to make changes to IT applications across the Group.\nDesign and operating effectiveness testing of controls used by the Group’s technology teams to schedule system jobs and monitor system integrity.\nDesign and operating effectiveness testing of controls in place to support Program Development, including the implementation of revised guidelines per the new ANZ Delivery Framework.\nDesign and operating effectiveness testing of automated business process controls include those that enforce segregation of duties conflicts between toxic role combinations within IT applications, configurations in place to perform calculations, mappings, and flagging of financial transactions, automated reconciliation controls, both between systems and intra-system and data integrity of critical system reporting used for sampling, data analysis and financial reporting across the audit\nOTHER INFORMATION\nOther Information is both financial and non-financial information in Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited’s annual reporting which is provided in addition to the Financial Report and the Auditor's Report.

The term “AASB” is commonly used when identifying AASs issued by the AASB. In doing so, the term is used together with the AAS number.\nADI – Authorised Deposit-taking Institution.\nAPRA – Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.\nAPS – ADI Prudential Standard.\nBCBS – Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.\nCash and cash equivalents comprise coins, notes, money at call, balances held with central banks, liquid settlement balances (readily convertible to known amounts of cash which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value) and securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repos) in less than three months.\nCash profit is an additional measure of profit which is prepared on a basis other than in accordance with accounting standards. Cash profit represents ANZ’s preferred measure of the result of the core business activities of the Group, enabling readers to assess Group and Divisional performance against prior periods and against peer institutions. To calculate cash profit, the Group excludes non- core items from statutory profit as noted below. These items are calculated consistently period on period so as not to discriminate between positive and negative adjustments.\nGains and losses are adjusted where they are significant, or have the potential to be significant in any one period, and fall into one of three categories:\n1. gains or losses included in earnings arising from changes in tax, legal or accounting legislation or other non-core items not associated with the ongoing operations of the Group;\n2. treasury shares, revaluation of policy liabilities, economic hedging impacts and similar accounting items that represent timing differences that will reverse through earnings in the future; and\n3. accounting reclassifications between individual line items that do not impact reported results, such as policyholders tax gross up.\nCash profit is not a measure of cash flow or profit determined on a cash accounting basis.\nCollectively assessed provision under AASB 139 is the provision for credit losses that are inherent in the portfolio but not able to be individually identified. A collectively assessed provision may only be recognised when a loss event has already occurred. Losses expected as a result of future events, no matter how likely, are not recognised.\nCollectively assessed allowance for expected credit loss under AASB 9 represent the Expected Credit Loss (ECL). This incorporates forward looking information and does not require an actual loss event to have occurred for an impairment provision to be recognised.\nCovered bonds are bonds issued by an ADI to external investors secured against a pool of the ADI’s assets (the cover pool) assigned to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. The primary assets forming the cover pool are mortgage loans. The mortgages remain on the issuer’s balance sheet. The covered bond holders have dual recourse to the issuer and the cover pool assets. The mortgages included in the cover pool cannot be otherwise pledged or disposed of but may be repurchased and substituted in order to maintain the credit quality of the pool. The Group issues covered bonds as part of its funding activities.\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from the failure of ANZ’s customers and counterparties to honour or perform fully the terms of a loan or contract.\nCredit risk weighted assets (CRWA) represent assets which are weighted for credit risk according to a set formula as prescribed in APS 112/113.\nCustomer deposits represent term deposits, other deposits bearing interest, deposits not bearing interest and borrowing corporations’ debt excluding securitisation deposits.\nCustomer remediation includes provisions for expected refunds to customers, remediation project costs and related customer and regulatory claims, penalties and litigation outcomes.\nDerivative credit valuation adjustment (CVA) – Over the life of a derivative instrument, ANZ uses a model to adjust fair value to take into account the impact of counterparty credit quality. The methodology calculates the present value of expected losses over the life of the financial instrument as a function of probability of default, loss given default, expected credit risk exposure and an asset correlation factor. Impaired derivatives are also subject to a CVA.\nDividend payout ratio is the total ordinary dividend payment divided by profit attributable to shareholders of the Company.\nFair value is an amount at which an asset or liability could be exchanged between knowledgeable and willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.\nGroup is Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (the Company) and the entities it controlled at the year end and from time to time during the financial year (together, the Group).\nGross loans and advances (GLA) is made up of loans and advances, acceptances and capitalised brokerage/mortgage origination fees less unearned income.\nIFRS – International Financial Reporting Standards.\nImpaired assets are those financial assets where doubt exists as to whether the full contractual amount will be received in a timely manner, or where concessional terms have been provided because of the financial difficulties of the customer. Financial assets are impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of a loss event that occurred prior to the reporting date, and that loss event has had an impact, which can be reliably estimated, on the expected future cash flows of the individual asset or portfolio of assets.\nImpaired loans comprise drawn facilities where the customer’s status is defined as impaired.\nIndividually assessed allowance for expected credit losses is assessed on a case-by-case basis for all individually managed impaired assets taking into consideration factors such as the realisable value of security (or other credit mitigants), the likely return available upon liquidation or bankruptcy, legal uncertainties, estimated costs involved in recovery, the market price of the exposure in secondary markets and the amount and timing of expected receipts and recoveries.\n227\nGlossary (continued)\nInterest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) relates to the potential adverse impact of changes in market interest rates on ANZ’s future net interest income. The risk generally arises from:\nNet tangible assets equal share capital and reserves attributable to shareholders of the Company less unamortised intangible assets (including goodwill and software).\n1. repricing and yield curve risk – the risk to earnings or market value as a result of changes in the overall level of interest rates and/or the relativity of these rates across the yield curve;\n2. basis risk – the risk to earnings or market value arising from volatility in the interest margin applicable to banking book items; and\n3. optionality risk – the risk to earnings or market value arising from the existence of stand-alone or embedded options in banking book items. Internationally comparable ratios are ANZ’s interpretation of the regulations documented in the Basel Committee publications; “Basel lll: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems” (June 2011) and “International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards” (June 2006). They also include differences identified in APRA’s information paper entitled “International Capital Comparison Study” (13 July 2015).\nLevel 1 in the context of APRA supervision, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited consolidated with certain approved subsidiaries.\nRegulatory deposits are mandatory reserve deposits lodged with local central banks in accordance with statutory requirements.\nRestructured items comprise facilities in which the original contractual terms have been modified for reasons related to the financial difficulties of the customer. Restructuring may consist of reduction of interest, principal or other payments legally due, or an extension in maturity materially beyond those typically offered to new facilities with similar risk.\nReturn on average assets is the profit attributable to shareholders of the Company, divided by average total assets.\nReturn on average ordinary shareholders’ equity is the profit attributable to shareholders of the Company, divided by average ordinary shareholders’ equity.\nRisk weighted assets (RWA) are risk weighted according to each asset’s inherent potential for default and what the likely losses would be in the case of default. In the case of non asset backed risks (i.e. market and operational risk), RWA is determined by multiplying the capital requirements for those risks by 12.5.\nLevel 2 in the context of APRA supervision, the consolidated ANZ Group excluding associates, insurance and funds management entities, commercial non-financial entities and certain securitisation vehicles.\nSettlement balances owed to/by ANZ represent financial assets and/or liabilities which are in the course of being settled. These may include trade dated assets and liabilities, vostro accounts and securities settlement accounts.\nNet interest margin is net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets.\nNet loans and advances represent gross loans and advances less allowance for expected credit losses.\nNet Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is the ratio of the amount of available stable funding (ASF) to the amount of required stable funding (RSF) defined by APRA. The amount of ASF is the portion of an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution’s (ADI) capital and liabilities expected to be a reliable source of funds over a one year time horizon. The amount of RSF is a function of the liquidity characteristics and residual maturities of an ADI’s assets and off- balance sheet activities. ADIs must maintain an NSFR of at least 100%.\n228\nImportant dates for shareholders1\nAPRIL 2020\nNOVEMBER 2020\n30th April\nHalf Year Results Announcement\n9th November\nFinal Dividend Ex-Date\nMAY 2020\n10th November\nFinal Dividend Record Date\n11th May\nInterim Dividend Ex-Date\n11th November\nDRP/BOP/Foreign Currency Record Date\n12th May\nInterim Dividend Record Date\nDECEMBER 2020\n13th May\nDRP/BOP/Foreign Currency Record Date\n16th December\nFinal Dividend Payment Date\nJULY 2020\n16th December\nAnnual General Meeting (Adelaide)\n1st July\nInterim Dividend Payment Date\nOCTOBER 2020\n14th October\nClosing date for receipt of director nominations\n29th October\nAnnual Results Announcement\nOur international presence and earning composition by geography2\nInternational $965 million\nAustralia $3,640 million\nNew Zealand $1,865 million\nInternational\nAsia China Hong Kong India Indonesia Japan Laos Malaysia\nMyanmar The Philippines Singapore South Korea Taiwan Thailand Vietnam\nPacific American Samoa Cook Islands Fiji Guam Kiribati New Caledonia Papua New Guinea Samoa\nSolomon Islands Timor-Leste Tonga Vanuatu\nEurope France Germany United Kingdom\nMiddle East\nUnited Arab Emirates (Dubai)\nUnited States of America\n1.\nIf there are any changes to these dates, the Australian Securities Exchange will be notified accordingly.\n2.

    "content": "ANZ\n2019 ANNUAL REVIEW\nOur success depends on improving the financial wellbeing of our customers\nCOVER STORY\nSupporting drought affected communities in rural Australia\nBrian and Heather Coxon established BJ & HD Coxon Oyster Farmers in 1985 – a time when stocks were plentiful and business was booming. Since that time, the business has faced some difficult times.\nAn ANZ customer for 10 years, Brian has appreciated the bank’s support through those times. “During the algae bloom in 2010 I went to ANZ and pleaded relief. We did not know when things would pick up. I am grateful for ANZ sticking with us through that time”.\nBrian recently found himself seeking the assistance of one of those agencies, reaching out to the Rural Financial Counselling Services (Southern NSW). The service, which is free, supports rural businesses through ongoing drought, poor production or anything else affecting their business and their life.\nFast forward to 2019 and Brian’s business is once again facing difficulties, this time as a result of the drought impacting much of Australia.\n“When you’re doing it tough it’s all too hard, and the state you are in does not always lead to rational decisions,” says Brian. “The financial counsellor looks at you as a person, as well as a business.”\n“Oyster farming needs fresh water,” says Brian. “Famine on the land means famine in the sea. The oysters have poor growth, it’s difficult to maintain their condition and they’re harder to sell.”\nLast year in response to the drought ANZ donated $500,000 to the Financial Counselling Foundation for use by rural counselling agencies working in drought affected communities.\nBrian looks forward to building up the business again, but he doubts things will ever be as good as they were in 1985. “This business is mostly about loving the lifestyle. People who want to be on the water and love working outdoors in Australia’s oldest aquaculture industry.”\nImage: Brian Coxon\nContents\n2019 performance snapshot\n1\nOur customers\nOur 2019 reporting suite\n2\nOur divisions\nWhat matters most\n3\nOur people\nChairman’s message\n4\nOur community\nCEO’s message\n6\nGovernance\nAbout our business\n8\nRisk management\nOur strategy\n9\nPerformance overview\nHow we create value\n10\nFive year summary\nWorking with our stakeholders\n12\nRemuneration Overview\nOur operating environment\n14\nImportant dates for shareholders\nBecoming a fairer and more responsible bank\n16\nContacts\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REVIEW\n17\n21\n24\n28\n32\n44\n52\n64\n66\n69\n70\n$\n2019 performance snapshot\n6.5\nCash proﬁt1\nb\n10.9%\nCash return on equity1\n160¢\nDividend for FY19 per share\n228¢\n9.2%\ntotal shareholder return\nCash earnings per share 1\n$19.59\nNet tangible assets per share 2\nCO2\n42.4%\nof employees volunteered\n11.4%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital 3\n$19.1b\nfunded and facili tated in environmentally sustainable solutions since 2015\n$\n>90,000\npeople have been reached through our ﬁnancial wellbeing programs, MoneyMinded and Saver Plus\n32.5%\nof women in leadership4\n$142.2m\nin community investment5\n1.

We seek to identify those issues that have the most potential to impact our ability to operate successfully and create value for our stakeholders.\nNew icons/infographics\nThese issues may change over time, reflecting changes in our business and external operating environment and the expectations of stakeholders. We use the results of the assessment to inform our strategy.\nWe have drawn on our 2018 materiality assessment to help guide the content of this report. After fairness and ethical conduct, stakeholders ranked the following four issues (risks or opportunities) as having the most potential to impact our value creation in the short, medium and long-term.\nMost material issues icons\nCustomer story icon\nThis year, we focused our assessment solely on fairness and ethical conduct, which has been ranked as our most material issue for the last three years. Specifically, we sought external stakeholder views on the actions we are taking following the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry (the Royal Commission).\nFraud and data security: ensuring we have strong internal controls and risk management frameworks in place is critical as a breach could significantly impact the bank’s operations and reputation.\nMost material issues icons\nCustomer story icon\nCustomer experience: ensuring a positive customer experience is key to delivering sustainable business performance in the long-term.\nMost material issues icons\nCustomer story icon\nNew icons/infographics\nStakeholders provided us with three key insights:\nCorporate governance: organisations with strong corporate governance processes and policies in place are likely to perform better in the long-term.\n1 They expect us to focus on long-term value creation, Most material issues icons\nCustomer story icon\nnot short-term profit maximisation;\nStakeholder icons\nNew icons/infographics\n2 While the actions we have taken to date in response to\nthe Royal Commission are considered good and necessary, they want us to do more.

Cash profit from continuing operations (which excludes non-core items and the discontinued Wealth businesses from statutory profit) was $6.5 billion, flat when compared with the same time last year.\nDespite those tough conditions, we held our FY19 full year dividend at 160 cents with the final dividend of 80 cents franked at 70%.\nWe recognise how important the dividend, franking and predictability is to shareholders. The Board’s decision to reduce franking to a new base reflects the changed shape of our business and the earnings in our Australian geography.\nThis has been a difficult year for us and Australian banks generally. Intense competition, slow credit growth and increased regulation have combined with lower consumer confidence to create this.\nWhile this is reflected in our financial performance – particularly within our Australian Retail and Commercial business – the actions taken in recent years to improve the structure of our bank has us well-placed to meet the industry’s challenges.\n4\nThese actions include returning our Institutional business to profitable growth as well as the progress we have made to simplify the products and services we offer our retail customers in Australia and New Zealand.\nWe started early on our simplification agenda and this work continued throughout the year. Simplification continues to underpin improvement across ANZ.\nA major milestone was the completion of the sale of our Life Insurance business in Australia to Zurich Financial Services Australia and we have also made significant progress in the sale of our Pensions & Investments business to IOOF. Subject to approval from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), we expect to complete this transaction in the first quarter of 2020.\nAnother highlight was the sale of some of our non-core assets outside of home markets, including our retail banking joint venture in Cambodia, our retail business in Papua New Guinea and our Life Insurance business in New Zealand. This continues the stronger focus on investments and resources in our core strategic retail and commercial businesses in Australia and New Zealand and our Institutional business in Asia Pacific.\nUnfortunately there have also been challenges. This year we have announced an additional charge of $682 million as a result of an increase in our provisions for remediation work. While our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Shayne Elliott addresses this in his CEO message, I want to assure shareholders that the Board understands the impact fixing the failures of the past has on shareholders and we are working proactively and as quickly as possible to remediate impacted customers.\nOur self-assessment\nDuring the year, APRA asked a range of banks, superannuation funds and insurance companies to take a closer look at their own behaviour and operations.\nThere has been some attention given to the fact ANZ has not released its self-assessment. APRA requested these self-assessments on a confidential basis to ensure institutions responded in a way that was full and frank. We have respected that request, noting particularly the fact that people contributed openly to the process on that basis and we will continue to do so. To assist those interested in our self-assessment we have published a summary which can be found on bluenotes at anz.com.\nThe self-assessment was a useful exercise where we identified many critical issues across culture, accountability and governance. As we outlined to APRA, the Board and executive team are determined to use this as an opportunity to deepen our self-awareness and to learn from our failings. Importantly, we do not see this as just a compliance measure but as an opportunity to make ANZ a more efficient, more sustainable bank.\nWe will be a simpler, less complex bank once we have implemented our road map for change.\nWe will have fewer products and more effective systems and processes. For customers, we will be easier to deal with and when things do go wrong we will be faster to resolve them.\nCritically, our regulator will recognise issues identified in our annual attestation are being resolved in a timelier manner and this will flow through to improvements in our comprehensive review.\nExecutive remuneration\nANZ recorded its ‘first strike’ last year when around 34% of shares were voted against our Remuneration Report. The Board took this result very seriously and shareholders will note there has been a significant differentiation this year in the remuneration awarded to our Disclosed Executives. Our Chair of the Human Resources Committee, Ilana Atlas, provides more detail in the Remuneration Report.\nYou will note our CEO despite a solid personal performance, has had his remuneration impacted by the broader performance of the Group. In fact, variable remuneration for our Disclosed Executives ranged between 0 and 74% of maximum opportunity. We also enhanced our approach to accountability and consequence management during the year and will continue to hold people to account who fail to meet our standards.\nCapital management\nWe continued our focus on capital efficiency this year by returning excess capital to shareholders as a result of our simplification agenda. We did this while also maintaining capital levels above APRA’s ‘unquestionably strong’ requirements. In the financial year of 2019 we reduced shares on issue by 42 million (equivalent of $1.1 billion) as part of our $3 billion buy-back. That program concluded in March 2019.\nOutlook\nWhile the Australian housing market is slowly recovering, we expect challenging trading conditions to continue for the foreseeable future.\nRecord low interest rates in Australia and global trade tensions will continue to place pressure on earnings while increased compliance and remediation costs will be closely managed.\nCompetition will also remain in focus with the recently announced inquiry into mortgage pricing. We have acknowledged we have not always done a good job in explaining our position and hope the inquiry enables the opportunity to provide facts on a complex matter.\nOn the regulatory front, both APRA and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand have announced proposals that could lift the amount of capital required to support our New Zealand subsidiary. The final impact of these changes depend on a number of factors. This includes the outcome of consultation, particularly the amount of capital required, the time allowed to achieve it, and the instruments we are permitted to use.\nManagement will maintain its focus on capital efficiency. However, our strong ongoing capital generation capacity will assist in meeting any additional capital requirements.\nDespite the industry’s challenges, I’m confident we have the team, the balance sheet and the oversight in place to execute effectively against a strategy that will benefit all our stakeholders. On behalf of the Board and myself, I thank our more than 39,000 people for their hard work in supporting our customers and our shareholders.\nDavid Gonski, AC CHAIRMAN\n5\nCEO’s message\nSHAYNE ELLIOTT\nThis has been a challenging year of slow economic growth, increased competition, regulatory change and global uncertainty.\nOur progress\nThe core of our strategy has not changed. Put simply, we will generate decent returns by improving the financial wellbeing of our customers.\nThis year we continued to focus on balance sheet strength, improve our culture, simplify the business and rebuild our team’s capabilities. In doing this, we significantly reduced the cost and risk of operating the bank despite the strong headwinds facing the sector.\nWe are determined to have the right people who listen, learn and adapt. We will put the best tools and insights into the hands of our customers and people. Importantly, we will concentrate our efforts on those particular things that add value to customers – and do them right the first time.\nThis means we must continue to simplify our business, improve our customer proposition and invest in innovations that deliver better customer outcomes and improve the efficiency of our operations.\nRetail and commercial in Australia had a difficult year. Increased remediation charges, intense competition and record low interest rates have had a significant impact on earnings.\n6\nWhile yet to flow through to the balance sheet, management actions and operational improvements have seen a steady recovery in home loan applications in recent months. These volume improvements are expected to be maintained into 2020.\nNew Zealand delivered a solid underlying result in a more competitive environment. As in Australia, compliance and remediation costs contributed to higher operating expenses, while a focus on operational efficiency offset inflation in business-as-usual expenses.\nThere are challenges ahead in New Zealand, particularly in relation to the amount of capital we may be required to hold. However, we are well-advanced in our preparations to manage these proposed impacts in an orderly way.\nInstitutional continued its transformation with a return to profitable growth. While macro conditions had an impact on financial performance in the second half, the business is now generating returns above our cost of capital that provides important diversification given the lower growth in our home markets.\nCustomer remediation\nThe Royal Commission highlighted many failures the Australian banks needed to quickly remedy. ANZ is not immune from this challenge.\nThis year we announced an additional charge of $682 million as a result of an increase in our provisions for remediation work. We know this is real money and has a real impact on shareholders. But we also know it’s important to fix the mistakes of the past and return money owed to customers as quickly as possible.\nWe are currently resolving identified fee or interest discrepancies with over 3.4 million Australia Retail and Commercial customers. To date our Responsible Banking team has remediated over one million customer accounts.\nIf there is a positive from this work, it is that much of the time and resources being invested in remediating our systems and processes will make us a better bank for our customers and shareholders. It means the mistakes of the past are unlikely to be repeated and when issues arise they will be easier to fix.\nCustomers and community\nOur purpose of shaping a world where people and communities thrive guides our decisions. An example of this is the program we have in place to proactively contact more than one million customers to help them get more value from our products and services, including those eligible for Centrelink or Veterans’ Affairs benefits or those with persistent credit card debt. This is to make sure customers are using the best products given their individual circumstances and that they are aware of all the options available.\nAnother issue we care about is providing affordable and sustainable housing for Australians and New Zealanders. We do this by encouraging investment in the sector – including our role leading the largest social bond issuance for housing in Australia.\nWe also know we have a role in enhancing environmental sustainability and we are focusing our efforts on energy, water and waste.\nWe have committed to fund and facilitate $50 billion by 2025 towards sustainable solutions for our customers, including initiatives that help improve environmental sustainability, increase access to affordable housing and promote financial wellbeing.\nThis is not philanthropy. It’s really good business for our customers and shareholders given the growth opportunities available in the sector. It’s also a business we are good at given our network and capabilities and an area we expect to grow rapidly in the coming years as the world grapples with environmental challenges.\nChanging how we reward our people\nThis year we introduced wide-ranging reforms to the way we pay people. Variable remuneration is now a smaller part of our people’s take-home pay and these reduced bonuses are determined by the overall performance of the bank.\nThis is not about paying our people less. It is an industry-leading initiative that will positively enhance our culture and become an important point of differentiation. It also addresses the negative impact an over-emphasis on individual bonuses within a bank can have on customers and the community.\nRedesigning how we reward our staff was one of the 16 key initiatives we announced as part of our initial response to the Royal Commission recommendations. As part of this, we also strengthened our accountability frameworks to ensure there are appropriate consequences for the small number of people who do not meet standards of behaviour or performance.\nFinally, despite this difficult environment, we have made good progress this year and I’d like to thank the more than 39,000 people who turn up for ANZ and work hard every day for our customers. I’m confident we have the right strategy and team to deliver great, sustainable results in the future for our customers, our shareholders and the community.\nShayne C Elliott CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n7\nAbout our business\nWe provide banking and financial products and services to around eight million individual and business customers, and operate in and across 33 markets.\nOur culture and values\nOur values are the foundation of how we work and are supported by our Code of Conduct. All employees and contractors must comply with the Code, which contains guiding principles and sets the standards for the way we do business at ANZ.\nWe care about:\nIntegrity\nCollaboration\nAccountability\nRespect\nExcellence\nOur purpose\nOur purpose is to help shape a world in which people and communities thrive. That means striving to create a balanced, sustainable society in which everyone can take part and build a better life.\nOne of the ways we are bringing our purpose to life is through helping to address complex issues that matter to society and are core to our business strategy. We are focusing our efforts on:\nThe United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) seek to respond to the world’s most pressing challenges. Business has an important role to play in helping achieve the SDGs. Recognising this we have identified our targets which are making a contribution to the achievement of the SDGs in our 2019 ESG Supplement available at anz.com/cs in December.\nfinancial wellbeing – improving the financial wellbeing of our customers, employees and the community by helping them make the most of their money throughout their lives;\nenvironmental sustainability – supporting household, business and financial practices that improve environmental sustainability; and\nhousing – improving the availability of suitable and affordable housing options for all Australians and New Zealanders.\nWe are contributing to these challenges by: developing innovative and responsible financial products and services; participating in relevant policy development and research; strengthening stakeholder partnerships; and harnessing the skills of our people. Fundamental to our approach is a commitment to fair and responsible banking – keeping pace with the expectations of our customers, employees and the community, behaving fairly and responsibly and maintaining high standards of conduct.\nThroughout this report we illustrate how we are embedding purpose into our business strategy, including through our Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) targets and performance objectives.\n8\nOur strategy\nOur strategy is focused on improving the financial wellbeing of our customers; having the right people who listen, learn and adapt; putting the best tools and insights into their hands; and focusing on those few things that really add value to customers and doing them right the first time.\nWe believe that the execution of our strategy will deliver decent returns for our shareholders, while achieving a balance between growth and return, short and long-term performance and financial and social impact.\nWithin our Institutional business we are creating an integrated trade, cash and markets experience, while developing and appropriately scaling our capabilities across geographies to deliver connectivity for our customers.\nWhile our focus has evolved over the past four years, the strategic imperatives remain the same: creating a simpler, better balanced bank; focusing our efforts where we can carve out a winning position; building a superior everyday experience to compete in the digital age; and driving a purpose and values led transformation.\nOur strategy has driven significant improvement in our business over the past four years. We have strengthened our balance sheet, improved our culture, simplified the business and rebuilt our people’s capabilities. In doing so we have reduced the costs and risks associated with running the bank.\nIn our Australian and New Zealand businesses we are: delivering improved customer outcomes, while rationalising our products and services; developing new compelling services and distribution options; and developing new initiatives to enhance our home owner and small business owner propositions.\nPurpose\nOur purpose is to help shape a world in which people and communities thrive\nStrategic Imperatives\nStrategy\nTarget Outcomes\nCreate a simpler, better capitalised, better balanced bank\nImproving the financial wellbeing of customers...\nImprove the financial wellbeing of our customers\nBuild a superior experience for our people and customers in order to compete in the digital age\n...looking to save for, buy and own a home\n...looking to start, buy and grow a business\n...looking to move capital and goods around the region\nDeliver decent returns for our shareholders -

Saver Plus is life changing, with research showing 87% of participants continue to save after they have completed the program.\n“It was so great to see the collaboration between everyone, regardless of who they worked for, because we all deliver the same program. To see the team feel so energised and motivated again was fantastic to witness,” said Cheryl Allen-Ankins, The Smith Family, Saver Plus Program Manager.\nPartnership has been the key to the continued success and impact of Saver Plus. The recent Saver Plus National Conference,\nLeft to right: Saver Plus Co-ordinators, Denise Clark, Graeme Grice and Cath Sweeney from The Smith Family at the Saver Plus National Conference\n13\nOur operating environment\nWe seek to anticipate and respond to the risks and opportunities arising in our external environment to ensure that we can continue to create value for our stakeholders. A summary of the issues influencing our strategy is outlined below.\nThese global trends present us with risks and opportunities\nRISKS\nOPPORTUNITIES\nLOWER CREDIT GROWTH ENVIRONMENT\nIncreasing competition and regulatory requirements places pressure on margins and customer volumes.\nNew approaches are needed to deliver products and services to our customers, together with efficient allocation of capital and resources to generate returns to shareholders.\nINCREASED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND STAKEHOLDER SCRUTINY\nTrust in the Australian and New Zealand banking industry has eroded over the past two years.\nIncreased regulatory expectations and focus places pressure on margins and customer volumes.\nCommunity concerns remain high following the Royal Commission in Australia and a number of regulatory developments in New Zealand. We can rebuild trust by transparently working with, and partnering with, government, regulators and NGOs to deliver improved customer outcomes.\nDIGITAL ADVANCEMENT AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE\nCompetition from existing and new competitors is increasing,\nBy improving our digital capabilities and investing in\nsupported by government policy, such as the consumer data right.\nWith the increase in digitisation, strong cyber security capability is critical.\nWith the increase in digitisation, strong cyber security capability is critical.\nDEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES\nDemand for home lending in Australia and New Zealand is impacted by a range of supply and demand factors largely outside of our control, including population growth, housing prices and dwelling construction.\nCommunity concerns about housing affordability remain high. We can help by partnering with business, government and NGOs to deliver innovative and practical housing solutions.\nENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE\nWe will continue to experience negative reputational impacts if we fail to raise standards across all our activities and take customer and societal impacts into consideration when making business decisions.\nBy continuing to focus on improving customer outcomes and strengthening our standards on issues such as environmental sustainability and human rights, we have an opportunity to differentiate ourselves from our peers.\nGLOBALISATION\nCommunity concerns about aspects of trade and investment\nWith increasing globalisation and the rise of Asia, we can support our customers to increase their cross-border trade and investment.\nWith increasing globalisation and the rise of Asia, we can support our customers to increase their cross-border trade and investment.\nIncreased trade and investment leads to higher incomes and employment for the communities in which ANZ operates.\nOur strategic imperatives assist us to respond positively to this environment and meet societal expectations\n14\nOur presence in Asia has helped Carman’s expand into overseas markets\nCUSTOMER STORY\nHelping our customers export to the world\nChances are if you have strolled down the supermarket cereal aisle recently you will have seen shelves stacked with boxes of Carman’s muesli.\nEstablished in 1992 by Carolyn Creswell with a modest $1,000, Carman’s is now a leader in breakfast and nutritious snacks, exporting to 35 countries.\nCarolyn views Carman’s relationship with ANZ similar to any other partnership.\nUsing our international footprint we have helped connect Carman’s to new markets, particularly in Asia, where there is an abundance of opportunity for Westernised products.\n“ANZ is a partner with us – the reality is ANZ is trying to make our business better. If our business is better, we are going to do more business with ANZ. We are all in this together.”\n“ANZ’s presence in Asia gives you introductions you would not have otherwise because of their connections. It is really impressive for an Australian bank to have that presence,” says Carolyn.\nThere is much ANZ can learn from Carman’s success, particularly given Carolyn puts that success down to a focus on the customer and having an engaged and passionate workforce – both central elements of ANZ’s own strategy.\nHaving had a banking relationship for more than 10 years, the journey for ANZ and Carman’s is centred on honesty, transparency and integrity, identifying the ways in which each partner can support the other.\nImage: Carolyn Creswell\n15\nBecoming a fairer and more responsible bank\nDuring this year we have continued to make changes to our culture, governance and accountability mechanisms to help improve customer outcomes and restore community trust.\nOur response to the Royal Commission\nAPRA Self-Assessment\nThe Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry (the Royal Commission) has had a profound impact on our organisation. We are determined to learn from our failures and build a bank that is worthy of the trust and respect of our customers and the community.\nIn late 2018, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) asked a range of financial services companies, including ANZ, to examine through a Self-Assessment Report their behaviours and operations in the wake of highly publicised misconduct in the sector.\nThe Commission’s report led us to further examine how we serve our customers. We identified eight lessons from our misconduct and failures to meet community standards and expectations. These lessons have informed our response to the ‘spirit and letter’ of the Royal Commission. We are now identifying measures that will allow us to be confident that these lessons have been acted on.\nWe submitted our Self-Assessment Report to APRA in November 2018, and have since developed a ‘roadmap’ to act on the themes raised in that report.\nWe identified five focus areas in which to concentrate our efforts to deliver better outcomes. These areas were identified both through the self-assessment as well as issues that were examined by the Royal Commission.\nOur first step was to identify which Commission recommendations we could quickly act on. This led to 16 initiatives to improve the treatment of our retail customers, small businesses and farmers in Australia. Some of the key commitments we have delivered on are:\nremoving overdrawn and dishonour fees on our Pensioner Advantage account (available to eligible recipients of Centrelink or Veterans’ Affairs pensions)\nFocus areas\nSimplification\nof our business, products and processes\nimproving our service to Indigenous customers in remote communities by setting up a dedicated phone service and giving them easier options to prove their identity\nCulture\nincluding the way we reward and recognise our people\npublishing principles to help family farming customers in financial distress\nGovernance and accountability\nincluding how we are held to account, and how we manage and execute change\npublishing principles on acting as a model litigant in disputes with our customers\nimplementing pay reforms that replace individual-based bonuses for most of our employees with an incentive based on the overall performance of the Group. In addition to progressing these 16 initiatives, Colin Neave, former Commonwealth Ombudsman and our first Customer Fairness Adviser (appointed in 2016), reviewed individual ANZ cases highlighted at the Royal Commission, taking action where appropriate to resolve matters.\nRemediation\nManagement of operational risk\nincluding expansion of our specialist customer remediation team\nreview and improvement of our operational risk framework\nThe majority of the recommendations in the Royal Commission final report require legislative change and we will continue to work with government as it implements those changes.\nExecutive Committee members have been assigned ‘ownership’ of each focus area and they are responsible for monitoring performance.\nWe have established a Royal Commission and Self-Assessment Oversight Group to oversee an integrated response to the Royal Commission and Self-Assessment.\nFurther details of our self-assessment can be found on bluenotes at anz.com.\n16\nOur customers\nConsistently delivering a positive customer experience enables us to create value for all of our stakeholders and is critical to our long-term success.\nWe seek to treat our customers fairly and responsibly, providing them with suitable and appropriate products and services, supported by strong data protection.\nLinks to 2019 Group Performance Framework\nWe have identified three customer segments where we believe we can best achieve this: home owners, business owners and companies that move capital and goods across the region.\nProviding suitable products and services\nWe have contacted more than 1 million of our retail and commercial customers, including customers who:\nare in receipt of eligible Centrelink or Veterans’ Affairs benefits to offer to help them move to a low-cost, basic bank account. Since June 2019, we have contacted 128,624 customers (via email or letters);\nWe are committed to improving the customer experience, as highlighted by the implementation of 16 initiatives in Australia in response to the Royal Commission. There were some challenges during the year including technology stability issues, and a period of underperformance in respect of assessment and approval times relative to peers in home lending. Institutional performance in key customer satisfaction/relationship strength surveys continued to be a highlight, along with strong digital engagement with customers.\nRefer to the Remuneration Report section of the Annual Report available at anz.com/shareholder/centre for further details.\nare experiencing persistent credit card debt;\nhave Interest Only home loans set to expire within 6 months, reminding them of the expiry period and notifying them of the options available at the end of the period;\nhave opened an ANZ Access Advantage account within the last 13–16 days, reminding them to credit their account with regular salary payments; and\nhave Progress Saver periodical payment or direct debit due to expire in the next month to remind them an automated credit can help them receive bonus interest on their account.\nCUSTOMER STORY Helping customers to get on top of credit card debt\nWe have been contacting credit card customers who are carrying persistent debt1 on their card to help them pay their debt faster.\nCustomers have been offered financial education, and the opportunity to close their card and repay the remaining debt at a lower interest rate. We have contacted 9,500 customers as at 30 September 2019.\nContinuing his current repayment behaviour, John would have taken more than 9 years to pay off the debt – assuming there was no further spending on the card – accruing at least $12,000 in interest over that time.\nEarlier this year we contacted John*, a long-term customer who has held a credit card facility with ANZ since 1976. John had a balance of $9,500 (on a $10,000 limit) and the entirety of the balance was on a cash advance interest rate of 21.74% per annum. John had not transacted on the card since 2016 and had been making payments only slightly above the minimum monthly repayment amount.\nAfter contacting John and explaining his options, John agreed to an instalment plan with an interest rate of 7% per annum. This will enable him to pay off the debt in five years or less, saving more than $10,000 in interest charges.\nThis program has been welcomed by many customers, including John who said, “I wish this had happened a long time ago … it’s such a relief.”\n1. Where for at least the last 12 months a credit card has over 80% of the credit utilised and the customer has been paying 2–3% of the outstanding balance on average each month. * Customer name has been changed.\n17\nOur customers continued\nHome owners\nWe are committed to fund and facilitate $1 billion of investment by 2023 to deliver around 3,200 more affordable, secure and sustainable homes to buy and rent in Australia.\nWe are developing a housing supply pipeline through direct engagement with our clients (new and existing), supporting innovative models to finance new supply. This includes:\njointly arranging the inaugural bond issue of $315 million for the Commonwealth’s National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (NHFIC), the largest social bond for housing in Australia; and\narranging the first wellbeing bonds in New Zealand for Housing New Zealand Corporation (NZ$500 million and NZ$600 million).\nWe have also established a Housing Virtual Fund (the Fund) enabling us to accommodate non-conforming risk aspects of new housing models. Emerging housing models generally come with increased risk for the developer, the bank and the consumer, preventing innovative models from being brought to market at scale. The Fund ensures that we have a comprehensive internal review process, allowing us to utilise all of our expertise in understanding and managing risk.\nSupport for first home buyers Our research shows that 64 percent of first home buyers are uncertain of what to do when it comes to buying their first property and they want someone they can trust to guide them through the process.1 In response, we are improving the skills of our frontline staff enabling them to provide tailored guidance and support to first home buyers. We have:\nprovided more than 3,300 frontline staff with Home Loan Coach training across Australia and New Zealand;\nMaking homes healthier in New Zealand\nAccording to research by the Building Research Association of New Zealand, about half of the homes built are unsuitable for the climate – they are not adequately insulated, have insufficient heating and are damp with visible signs of mould.\n“As New Zealand’s biggest home lender, housing is one area where we want to make a difference”, says Antonia Watson, Acting Chief Executive Officer, New Zealand.\nimproved our First Home Coach training in Australia – nearly 800 of our frontline staff have completed this training; and\nprovided Construction Coach training in New Zealand to support customers building or renovating a home – more than 220 frontline staff have received training.\nWe have also developed the most accurate property price predictor in the market to support customers in establishing the value of their future home.\nWe have set aside NZ$100 million so our customers can enjoy warmer, healthier homes while potentially also keeping energy costs down. Last year we began offering our home loan customers (both owner-occupiers and investors) an interest- free home loan top-up (up to NZ$5,000). More than 1,800 interest-free home loans (to the value of NZ$6.3 million) have been drawn down as at 30 September 2019. The top-up offer was also extended to heat pumps in July 2019.\nIn recognition of our commitment to this customer segment ANZ has been named Bank of The Year for First Home Buyers by Canstar for three years running (2017–2019).\nIn addition, in April 2019 we launched a Healthy Home Loan Package, that includes discounts to standard home loan rates, as well as fee waivers across a range of accounts, for customers buying, building or renovating a home to 6 Homestar or above, in New Zealand.\nIndustry insights During the year we have undertaken significant engagement with industry stakeholders to ensure that as an organisation we are directly linked to the housing policy agenda, offering market expertise to support government, customers and the community with relevant insights to inform decision-making.\nThirty four customers are now on the package (funds under management of NZ$11.7 million) and we are working to identify existing eligible customers to transition them across to the package.\nNot only are there health benefits associated with more energy efficient homes but occupants may also have more disposable income because they are paying lower power bills.\nWe have entered into a three-year partnership with CoreLogic to deliver a bi-annual housing affordability report. The report provides in-depth market analysis of the Australian housing market for both buyers and renters.\n“When every dollar counts, a lower home loan rate might swing the decision to go the extra mile on health and sustainability measures.” says Antonia.\n1.

To date our Australian Retail and Commercial Responsible Banking team has remediated over one million customer accounts5 and issued refunds of around $62 million.\nOne way in which we measure the experience of our customers is through Net Promoter Score. Net Promotor Score enables us to gauge whether we are meeting customer needs and expectations and how we are performing relative to peers. It is measured by asking customers how likely they are to recommend ANZ (on a 0–10 scale) and is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors (those who give a score of 0–6) from the percentage of promoters (those who give a 9 or 10).\nIn Wealth, the team has completed the first stage of a review to identify instances of inappropriate advice to customers. Over 7,000 advice cases, spanning more than a decade, were reviewed. In addition, the majority of remediation cases relating to ANZ Financial Planning ‘fee for no service’ have now been remediated.\nWith respect to our Australian and New Zealand Retail and Commercial customers we failed to meet our target to improve our Net Promoter Score relative to peers. Our Institutional ranking remains at number one in both Australia and New Zealand.\n$\nWealth has remediated nearly 26,000 cases in total and made payments of $95.2m as at 30 September 2019.\nOver the 12 months to 30 September 2019, the Responsible Banking team has increased the number of dedicated remediation resources working on large scale customer remediation matters from around 150 to around 275 people.\nManaging customer complaints Listening to our customers and responding to their complaints in a timely, transparent and fair way is key to maintaining their confidence and trust in us.\nThis year, both the Australian Financial Complaints Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission identified the need for significant improvement in our internal dispute resolution. High complaint volumes and lengthy delays in resolution were highlighted. We have established a detailed action plan which sets out the changes we need to make to improve our customers’ experience and we will keep stakeholders informed of our progress.\nSimilarly, the team within Wealth has expanded from around 120 to around 170 over the same time period and is projected to increase to around 200 by December 2019. Our New Zealand business also has almost 60 dedicated remediation resources. These additional resources, together with an increase in infrastructure and capability, are enabling us to refund impacted customers in a scalable and repeatable way.\nFor further information on our approach to complaints handling, complaint volumes and the role of our Customer Advocate refer to our 2019 ESG Supplement available at anz.com/cs in December.\nMore than 500 people throughout the Australian Retail and Commercial business are also working on a number of smaller customer remediations, fixes and investigations.\nWe are delivering an ongoing education program to share ‘lessons learnt’ and to highlight the impacts on customers when we fail to get it right. In creating a collective understanding of the root causes of our existing remediations, we continue to build a shared accountability for the prevention of future issues.\n1.

Of the 2.8 million customers using our ANZ app, 36 percent are using mobile banking only – up 30 percent this year, demonstrating the significant shift in how customers are choosing to engage with us.\nWe are implementing digital solutions to assist our customers to improve their financial wellbeing. We have developed new features in the ANZ app to help our customers work towards their financial objectives by setting and tracking goals. Currently in the pilot phase, new features include data-driven ‘nudges’ (messages) to customers via the app, with milestones and tips to help them meet their savings goals.\nThis digital banking evolution brings both opportunities and challenges for ANZ. We are tailoring our products and services to the changing habits of our customers, who have told us they want more flexibility in their banking. Our digital technology now makes it possible for our customers to serve themselves, anywhere, anytime and we are adapting the way we operate to accommodate this. Peak usage on the ANZ app is between 4–6pm, and even during our quietest time between 12–2am we are serving almost 100,000 customers.\nOf the 2.8 million customers using our ANZ app, 36 percent are using mobile banking only – up 30 percent this year\nWith increasing digitalisation, a strong cyber security capability is critical\nThe benefits of open banking\nAs our customers choose to move their banking to digital platforms we are focused on safeguarding their money and personal information. We have invested heavily in our cyber security capability, and are in a strong position to keep our systems, data and customers safe from the increasing pace, scale and sophistication of cyber-attacks.\nOpen banking regulation came into force at the start of July in Australia, supporting the sharing of generic product data with third parties, with the aim of making it easier for customers to compare products. The sharing of customer specific data will start in early 2020. This will enable consumers to access data about themselves (personal, account and transaction data) and share it with accredited third parties of their choice.\nAt the heart of open banking is trust in how open banking participants manage their customers’ data. We will continue to invest in our customers’ security and privacy, and apply our ethical principles to all data use and the outcomes that result.\nRecognising humans play a significant role in the security ‘ecosystem’, we are delivering comprehensive education programs for employees and customers, simplifying cyber security, and making it easier to understand and implement. This year we have developed workshops to help small businesses stay safe online, raised awareness of online scams and reached millions of customers through our campaign to help them protect their ‘virtual’ valuables. We are also helping to develop the cyber security curriculum for Australian high schools to ‘grow’ the next generation of cyber security workers.\nOur Data Ethics Principles put our customers’ interests first in how their data is collected, used and disclosed; and provide mechanisms for transparency and choice to help our customers understand and control their personal information.\nPromoting a culture where security is everyone’s business means we are better placed to protect our systems, data and our customers, and can actively contribute to digital innovation and the economic opportunities a secure online world offers.\nWe will uphold these principles as the open banking regime begins, ensuring our customers can request the sharing of their data, while also maintaining control over where and how their data is used.\nBiometric authentication protecting customer payments in Australia and New Zealand\n“The emerging Australian data economy, sustained by customer- driven data sharing frameworks, should give customers more control in sharing information with confidence. Also, it should create opportunities for business to leverage their expertise, experience and technology into new areas to serve their customers. Businesses that engage with the data sector will have the opportunity to offer better services, and a more precise product to meet customer needs. Their customers should have the opportunity to benefit from enhanced choice and convenience. The efficient use of data, in a secure ecosystem with a strong governance structure, could be tremendously beneficial for businesses and customers alike.”\nScott Farrell, Chair of Open Banking Review\nANZ was the first Australian bank to enable its customers to make high value payments (up to $25,000) via the ANZ app using their voice. Our voice ID technology allows customers to verify their identity using their voice, rather than a PIN or password. While still an emerging technology, we currently have almost one million customers in Australia registered for voice ID. To date there have been no instances of fraud from a voice biometric breach.\nSupplementary disclosures\nRefer to our 2019 ESG Supplement available at anz.com/cs in December for further disclosures, including historical data tables.\n20\nOur divisions\nAustralia Retail and Commercial\n“ While this year has had its challenges, I’m pleased our recent actions have restored momentum in our home loans business and with the progress we’ve made in fixing the failures of the past.”\nMark Hand – Group Executive Australia Retail and Commercial Banking\nExternal operating environment\nBusiness strategy outcomes\nPerformance1\nIn Australia credit growth is slowing, revenue growth is negligible, interest rates are at record lows and regulation has increased substantially.\nCompetition too is intense, particularly in the home loan market. New competitors built to make the most of digital innovations to serve customers are also having an impact.\nThe housing market activity is improving off the back of the lower interest rates, and the removal of investor and interest only lending caps, but it is too soon to call a recovery.\nBusinesses remain cautious and are taking a ‘wait and see’ approach with the economy. Investment continues to be below long- term averages.\nMomentum has returned in home lending with applications up 34% in the second half of 2019 (compared with the first half ), through improving turnaround times and greater clarity on lending policies, adjustments to lending caps and a major marketing campaign to restore confidence across our distribution channels. We are confident this will flow through to settlements.\nMore than half of our customers now bank digitally and the ANZ App has 2.8 million users making more than $380 million worth of transactions every day.\nOur ANZ Business Growth Program has created more than 1,300 jobs and participants have increased their revenue by 374% and profit by 461%.\nThrough our network and insights, our customers continue to succeed in Asia and more than 200 have joined us for delegations to China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam and Japan.\n2019 was a challenging year for Australia Retail and Commercial, impacted by continued margin erosion, lower average lending volumes (a combination of the external environment and ANZ conservative business settings) and reduction in fee Income.\nThe home loan portfolio, down 3%, was affected by slowing system credit growth, competition and more conservative home loan origination risk settings. Commercial Lending, also down 2%, was driven by lower volumes in Small Business Banking.\nCustomers grew by more than 130,000 in the year to 6.4 million, with 3.6 million customers now digitally active. Deposits also increased in 2019 to $208 billion, with Retail deposits up 1% and Commercial up 5%.\nProductivity initiatives, including workforce and branch optimisation delivered cost savings and offset increased investment spending.\nFinancial Performance for Australia Retail and Commercial is provided within the Our Performance section on pages 52 to 65.\n1.

Our focused strategy is delivering results, and we’re staying vigilant in managing risks relating to geopolitics, global trade and consumer retail trends.”\nMark Whelan – Group Executive Institutional\nExternal operating environment\nBusiness strategy outcomes\nPerformance\nMarket conditions have been challenging, particularly in the second half of this financial year. This is due to a combination of record low interest rates, high liquidity, low volatility, and heightened geopolitical tensions.\nInstitutional is focused on customers who value us, working within clear priority sectors, sharpening our geographic focus, simplifying products and technology and driving structural efficiencies.\nInstitutional continued to deliver the benefits of a simpler and more disciplined business in 2019, reporting an increase in Cash Profit and growth in the balance sheet. Net Loans and Advances were up 10% while customer deposits grew 6%.\nChina has been adapting to a slowing economy, while the inverted US Treasury yield curve sparked fears of a potential economic recession in the world’s largest economy.\nShifts in trade and supply chains due to the US-China trade war have had a positive impact on some markets, particularly in South-East Asia, where ANZ has a presence.\nANZ is also well prepared for Brexit with our European branch network and licensing arrangements meaning customers do not need to make changes or open new accounts in order to continue to bank with us in Europe.\nFollowing our decision to exit lower returning and non-core customer relationships, Institutional is now in the process of pivoting to responsible and disciplined growth. We have also maintained our focus on reducing costs and capital efficiency.\nThis has delivered leading market positions across key geographies (#1 Australia & NZ, #5 Asia) and #1 in overall relationship quality for the second year running.\nThe sale of Retail, Commercial and SME in Papua New Guinea completed in September 2019 has enabled the business to focus on Institutional banking. The sale of our stake in Royal Bank in Cambodia (completed in July 2019) was also an important step in our simplification strategy.\nGeographically, Australia, New Zealand and Asia Pacific, Europe & America all delivered profit growth, supported by strong customer revenue growth.\nTransaction Banking and Loans and Specialised Finance both increased revenue in 2019, up 8% and 7% respectively. Markets revenue was down marginally due to lower Balance Sheet revenue, while Franchise Sales and Franchise Trading both delivered stronger revenue outcomes.\nFocus on productivity contributed to another year of cost reductions, a result of lower full time equivalent staff, decrease in software amortisation and property efficiencies.\nCredit charges remained below long run trends.\nFinancial Performance Cash continuing1\nFinancial Performance for Institutional is provided within the Our Performance section on pages 52 to 65.\n% of Group Profit FY19\nCash proﬁt ($m)\nNet Loans & Advances ($b)\n28%\n2019\n1,828\n2019\n165\n2018\n1,480\n2018\n150\n% of Group Net Loans & Advances\nReturn on Avg.

Business and consumer confidence is down due to uncertainty in the international economic outlook. This has resulted in lower business investment and consumer spending. That has meant the historically low official cash rate environment has not provided the economic stimulus many had hoped for.\nThe level of regulatory scrutiny is increasing on all financial services entities in New Zealand and this is increasing compliance costs for the business.\nThe proposed RBNZ capital changes – which are intended to create a stronger and more robust banking industry and are expected to be made public in December 2019.\nWe continued to progress our strategy of simplifying the business and improving customer experience.\nThe OnePath Life insurance business sale was completed in November 2018, as well as other non-core ANZ New Zealand assets Paymark and ANZ Securities.\nFrontline sales incentives were removed in 2019 to give confidence to customers that any products and services they purchased were sold to them for the right reasons.\nIn striving to be the best bank to help Kiwis own homes, we developed a market leading proposition that includes a “healthy homes” package to better insulate and heat houses.\nThe Commercial and Agri, and Institutional parts of ANZ New Zealand had a major focus on environmental initiatives to assist customers in the economy.\nOur New Zealand business maintained a leading position in core banking products this year, with ~31% share of mortgages (August 2019), ~34% share of household deposits (August 2019) and ~24% share of KiwiSaver (June 2019).\nWhile the operating conditions were more challenging, Retail and Commercial both delivered balance sheet growth in 2019. Retail net loans and advances were up 4% (driven by Home Loan growth), and Commercial lending up 2%. Revenue for the division was however impacted by margin pressure from lower deposit margins and home loan mix changes.\nCustomer deposits grew 3% and customer numbers grew modestly to 2.4 million, of which 1.5 million customers are digitally active. Digital sales were up ~4% and now account for ~ 30% of all retail sales.\nWithin the Wealth unit, superannuation product Kiwisaver continued its strong growth, surpassing $14.5 billion in funds under management.\nFocus in recent years on more conservative lending standards, together with a benign credit environment, contributed to provision charges remaining low this year.\nFinancial Performance Cash continuing1\nFinancial Performance for New Zealand is provided within the Our Performance section on pages 52 to 65.\n% of Group Profit FY19\nCash proﬁt (NZDm)\nNet Loans & Advances (NZDb)\n22%\n2019\n1,479\n2019\n126\n2018\n1,655\n2018\n122\n% of Group Net Loans & Advances\nReturn on Avg.

Both a strong risk mindset and behaviours are embedded in our values, Code of Conduct and performance expectations, and we are committed to providing a safe environment in which all employees are empowered to ‘speak up’ and raise ideas or issues and concerns. Customer story icon\nCustomer story icon\nWe seek to understand and improve our culture on an ongoing basis and are continually improving the way we track and measure our progress. One way we do this is through our Enterprise Culture Steering Group, whose membership includes the CEO and other members of the Executive Committee, which meets twice a year and provides an opportunity for each Executive to present the cultural strengths and development areas of their business, and actions taken and planned to shift the culture.\nCulture assessments\nStakeholder icons\ncreating a diverse and inclusive workplace and building our people’s resilience and wellbeing.\nStakeholder icons\nWe are supported by a team of specialists in our Internal Audit group who undertake cultural assessments within the bank. These assessments assist our leaders to understand the culture within the business, how culture impacts the way we support customers and where culture could expose us to risk.\nLinks to 2019 Group Performance Framework Stakeholder icons How We Creat Value Icons Highlights during the year include: strengthening our Accountability and Consequence Framework; evolving our approach to measurement and governance of culture initiatives; redesigning and launching changes to how Stakeholder icons How We Creat Value Icons we manage and reward our people; solid progress in the investment in key skills for our future; launch of a digital How We Creat Value Icons learning platform; and a record level engagement survey result.\nThe assessments focus on identifying cultural themes, underlying factors and their impact to support the business to drive sustainable change toward ANZ’s desired culture. They incorporate a blend of quantitative data, primarily through an employee survey, as well as qualitative data through employee focus groups.\nMore than 20,000 employees have participated in culture assessments (since 2016)\nRefer to the Remuneration Report section of the Annual Report available at anz.com/shareholder/centre for further details.\nOnce an assessment is completed, the implementation of actions to address cultural challenges is monitored, and the effectiveness of those actions in shifting towards the desired culture is reviewed.\nHow We Creat Value Icons\nHow We Creat Value Icons\n24\nStrengthening our risk culture\nDuring 2019 we have strengthened the way we deal with risk events through an enhanced Accountability and Consequence Framework, which is applicable to all of our people.\nNew Accountability and Consequence Principles set out when and how an accountability review will be conducted following a material risk or audit event, define the various categories of accountability (e.g. direct, indirect, collective) and provide guidelines for the relevant Group Executive to consider in determining appropriate consequences. Appropriate consequences should reflect the severity of the issue and may include, for example, one or more of the following: coaching, counselling, formal warnings, impacts to performance and remuneration outcomes, impacts on promotion, application of malus and ultimately termination of employment for the most serious issues.\nThe Consequence Review Group (CRG), chaired by the CEO, oversees the implementation and ongoing effectiveness of the Accountability and Consequence Framework, being cognisant of its impact on the culture of ANZ. The CRG reviews material risk and audit events and associated accountability and consequences. Our ongoing focus on accountability, consequences and driving a strong risk culture supports our customer commitment that when things go wrong, we fix them quickly and consistently hold executives to account where appropriate.\n‘Speak up’ culture We also seek to support a strong ‘speak up’ culture and ensure managers recognise exemplary risk and audit behaviours. The focus on ‘speak up’ is being supported through our New Ways of Leading (NWOL) that are aligned with our purpose and values. NWOL focuses on five behaviours relevant for all employees and imperative for people leaders: be curious, create shared clarity, empower people, connect with empathy and grow people selflessly. We are incorporating culture into leader-led team activities to facilitate open, purposeful conversations about our culture and practices and create a psychologically safe environment for employees to ‘speak up’. We continue to promote and raise employee awareness of the various ways that employees can ‘speak up’ including through initiatives such as the Whistleblower Awareness Week.\nWe have 39,060 full-time equivalent employees\nApplication of consequences In 2019 across the Group, 151 employees were terminated for breaches of our Code of Conduct. A further 516 employees received a formal disciplinary outcome, with managers required to apply impacts to their performance and remuneration outcomes as part of the annual review process.\nLeft to right: ANZ employees, Sewmee Samarasinghe and Kate London\nAt the senior leadership level, 30 current or former senior leaders (Senior Executives, Executives and senior managers) had a formal consequence applied in 2019 for Code of Conduct breaches or findings of accountability for a material event, or otherwise left the bank after an investigation had been initiated. The 30 employees represent ~ 1% of the senior leader population. The consequences applied included warnings, impacts to performance and/or remuneration outcomes and cessation of employment.\nSenior leader consequences in 20191\nPerformance and remuneration consequence\nFormal warnings\nNo longer employed\n1.\nIndividuals are included under all categories that are relevant meaning one individual may be reflected in multiple categories.\nChanges to remuneration\nA key focus this year has been the redesign of the way we financially reward and manage the performance of our people to better support our purpose, culture and values. The changes include rebalancing the way we pay our people so that variable remuneration is a smaller part of take home pay. For the majority of employees, variable remuneration will be based on Group performance only (i.e. no individual bonuses). These changes will apply from financial year 2020, and are more closely aligned to our desired culture, with increased focus on collaboration and team performance, as well as individual growth and development.\nWe are implementing the recommendations from Stephen Sedgwick’s ‘Retail Banking Remuneration Review’, which is focused on strengthening the alignment of retail bank incentives, sales practices and good customer outcomes. Recommendations that ANZ is delivering independently are 90% complete and will be fully implemented well ahead of the October 2020 deadline. We continue to work with industry to progress the recommendations for third parties and principles to underpin customer metrics. Management provides regular updates to the Board Human Resources Committee on progress.\n23\n12\n7\n25\nOur people continued\nBuilding workforce capability\nDiversity, inclusion and wellbeing\nWe are creating an environment where our people can learn and grow every day, helping us to build organisational agility and capability to remain competitive.\nWe are making progress on our priority to build an engaged, diverse and inclusive workforce. We want our workforce to reflect the communities we serve and believe that leveraging the diversity of our people will allow us to innovate and improve customer experience.\nWe are building the capabilities of our leaders through the introduction of a new leadership feedback survey giving our leaders tangible and actionable feedback on their strengths and development opportunities. We continue to track the demonstration of our NWOL behaviours and our people are telling us through the leadership and engagement surveys that they are seeing their leaders demonstrating improvements across all five behaviours.\nThis year our efforts have focused on enabling social and economic participation through providing employment opportunities for people from under-represented groups (including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, people with disability and refugees). Overall, we are broadly on-track to meet our target to recruit >1,000 people from these groups by the end of FY20, reaching 734 since 2016.\nEmployee engagement: 77% (up from 73% in 2018)1\nOur Spectrum Program is designed to offer employment opportunities to the autism community (sometimes described as part of the neurodivergent community) to build fulfilling careers in areas such as cyber security, coding and testing. This year we welcomed additional participants and nearly half of our original cohort moved into permanent ongoing employment with ANZ.\nIn addition, we are building the capabilities critical to delivering our strategy and to future-proofing our workforce, with a focus on investing in our pipeline of data and engineering talent with new roles and development opportunities in data analysis and science.\n?\n734 people employed from under-represented groups (since 2016)\nDuring the year we launched a new social learning platform – Our Way of Learning (OWL). Combining the functionality of a search engine and a social learning network, OWL offers employees free access to internal subject matter experts at ANZ and external content providers and user-generated content. OWL can be accessed by our people anywhere, anytime, and on any device.\nIn 2019 our people undertook almost 1.5 million hours of learning to increase their skills and capabilities, including self-directed learning through OWL.\nWe recognise that addressing the barriers preventing women from being fairly represented in senior roles is the key to closing our gender pay gap. We have a target in place to increase the representation of Women in Leadership to 34.1%2 by the end of the financial year 2020. This year representation has increased by 0.5% (up from 32% as at September 2018). Our progress is monitored monthly by the CEO and an Executive Committee.\nA summary of our policy position on Diversity and Inclusion can be found at anz.com/corporate governance.\nWe continue to make strong progress in supporting our people’s safety and wellbeing. Our Health and Safety policy, and associated programs, ensure that we provide an environment that enables employees to participate fully in the workplace and perform at their best. This year we have increased our focus on employee wellbeing, encompassing the areas of mental, physical, social and financial wellbeing.\nWe also provide opportunities for our people to contribute to the communities in which they live and work through our giving and volunteering programs.

When you buy a coffee from us you’re creating training and employment opportunities for marginalised young Victorians, helping create change in coffee farming communities around the world and saving tonnes of disposable paper cups going to landfill each year.” says Bec.\nSTREAT’s newest location is a café housed inside ANZ’s campus at 839 Collins Street in Melbourne.\nOur decision to partner with a social enterprise was a deliberate and considered one. With the opening of our new building this year there was an opportunity to look at the tendering process differently and select a partner that aligned directly with our own values and purpose.\nTrainees completing STREAT’s six month intensive program will spend two shifts a week at one of STREAT’s cafés. Bec says a strong rapport is built within the office environment over that time and corporate staff often ask about the trainees after they graduate.\nLeft to right: Ryan McDonald – Cafe Operations Manager, STREAT, Bec Scott OAM – STREAT co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, Elise Bennetts – Chief Relationship Officer, STREAT\n27\nOur community\nStrong relationships with our stakeholders and the broader community are critical to our success. Banking is based on trust and we are working hard to regain the community’s trust following the Royal Commission.\nIn 2019\n$\n42.4% of employees volunteered\nWe matched employee donations, collectively contributing over $2 million to charitable organisations\nEmployees volunteered 134,930 hours to community organisations\nImproving financial wellbeing – at the core of our strategy\nFinancial wellbeing contributes significantly to overall health and wellbeing, community connectedness and economic and social participation.\nOver many years we have invested in community programs, including Saver Plus and MoneyMinded, which have been proven to be an important part of the financial inclusion story for lower- income people. These programs have helped to build financial skills and resilience, develop active savings habits and improve overall financial wellbeing.\nOur financial inclusion program partnerships change lives\nSaver Plus – developed by Brotherhood of St Laurence and ANZ in 2003, program participants open an ANZ savings account, set a savings goal and save towards it regularly over 10 months while also attending MoneyMinded financial education sessions. On reaching their goal, savings are matched by ANZ dollar for dollar, up to $500, which must be spent on education.\nLinks to 2019 Group Performance Framework\nSince 2003, Saver Plus has reached over 43,600 lower-income participants and is expected to enable over $33 million of private sector funds to be invested in education by 2020.\nRegaining the trust of the community, government and other key stakeholders remains a major focus – our Reptrak community sentiment indicator improved over the 12 months to 58.8 but remains well below pre Royal Commission levels. We have retained high scores in a number of indices:\nMoneyMinded – this program supports adults with low levels of financial literacy and those on lower incomes across 21 markets, including Australia and New Zealand. It is delivered by community partner organisations in Australia and New Zealand, and a mix of community organisations and ANZ employees in Asia and the Pacific.\nCorporate Confidence Index (CCI)1: Score above peer average\nDow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI)2: 2019 score of 82 (2018: 83).

Stepping Stones is a micro- enterprise program offered to women who have migrant, refugee or asylum seeker backgrounds.\nOriginally from Lebanon, Taghrid arrived in Australia 10 years ago with her husband and one-year-old daughter. Keen to start her own business making special occasion cakes she took part in Stepping Stones, completing MoneyMinded in the process. MoneyMinded taught her about prioritising her spending and deciphering between ‘needs and wants’.\nMoneyMinded has also changed her attitude to money. Taghrid is careful with her money, but she is also finding alternatives so she and her family are not missing out on enjoying life.\n“I’m not cutting anything, I’m not suffering. But at the same time, if I need something, I have money to buy it in a different way. I cut my coffee, but I enrolled in a gym,” she said.\nShe also learned about the value of having ‘emergency money’. Since completing MoneyMinded Taghrid regularly transfers $50 into a specific savings account, ‘just like paying a bill’. With these savings she was able to buy a replacement car when hers broke down – before MoneyMinded she would have been without a car for several months.\nTaghrid has clear financial goals now too – a short-term goal of saving for materials for her business and a longer-term goal for her family to buy a home.\nImage: MoneyMinded participant Taghrid\n29\nOur community continued\nCommunity investment\nPublic policy debate\nIt is important that we are a part of the communities in which we operate, and we provide many opportunities for our people to get involved through our community programs – volunteering, funding and participating in community projects, or donating through workplace giving.\nWe seek to contribute constructively to policy debate and understand the perspectives of our community’s elected representatives, policy makers and regulators. We contribute to debate on business, economic, social and environmental issues affecting our customers and shareholders.\nThe strength of our relationships with partners in the not-for-profit sector is key to our ability to support the delivery of much needed services to the community. Many of our partners work in areas aligned to our priority areas of financial wellbeing, housing and environmental sustainability.\nWe work in a collaborative and open way as members of associations that have similar interests and approaches to ours.\nIn 2019 our key membership payments were:\nAustralian Banking Association\n$4,045,653\nBusiness Council of Australia\n$93,500\n$142.2 million in community investment1\nNew Zealand Bankers’ Association (NZD)\nBusiness New Zealand (NZD)\n$294,979\n$40,250\nWorkplace giving\nOur workplace giving program enables employees in Australia to make contributions to around 30 charity partners through regular pre-tax payroll deductions. This year we introduced ‘double matching’ – for every dollar donated by an employee (up to $5,000 per employee in a tax year) through the program, ANZ donates two dollars.\nPayment to the Australian Banking Association includes our annual fee as well as expenditure related to communications activity, contribution to the establishment of a not-for-profit Debt Repayment Service, industry initiatives in response to the Royal Commission’s work, and industry reform activity such as the new Banking Code of Practice.\nPublic policy advocacy\nOur employees in New Zealand and Fiji can also donate through payroll to their respective staff foundations (charitable trusts that provide small grants) and ANZ double matches donations.\nWe understand that some of our stakeholders are particularly interested in positions we hold on issues such as data security, privacy and climate change and our membership of industry associations that undertake advocacy on these issues.\nVolunteering\nOur Volunteer Leave Policy, which applies to permanent, regular and fixed-term employees provides for at least one day of paid volunteer leave each year.\nIt is not the role of any association to represent solely ANZ’s, nor any other single member’s view. It is also not possible for industry associations to obtain a consensus on every issue. There is sometimes disagreement amongst members about the final positions taken by industry associations and even if we do not agree with it, we will participate in discussions. From time to time, we may take positions on certain matters not supported by the relevant industry association. For example, ANZ was the first major bank to support a ‘last resort’ compensation scheme for victims of misconduct. Such a scheme is now public policy.\nSupplementary disclosures\nRefer to our 2019 ESG Supplement available at anz.com/cs in December for further disclosures, including historical data tables.\nWe place high importance on the ability to hold constructive dialogue within an association’s membership and we expect industry associations to be receptive to member feedback regarding their lobbying or advocacy approaches.\n1.

This is not about charitable works, it’s about bringing the full force of ANZ, one of the largest financial institutions in the country to bear; to have an impact and to shape the world for good.”\nA relatively new type of financing, social bonds are structured so the proceeds fund a social purpose. In this case, owning a NHFIC or HNZ bond is an indirect investment into Australia and New Zealand’s social and affordable housing sector. The return is based on the credit-worthiness of the borrower who is responsible for directing the financing to social causes, with an obligation to report accordingly.\nPartnering with NHFIC and HNZ allowed ANZ to join forces and draw on each organisation’s expertise in order to deliver better outcomes for a range of stakeholders.\nLeft to right: Nathan Dal Bon – Chief Executive Officer, National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation, Caryn Kakas – Head of Housing Strategy, Group Strategy, ANZ and Tessa Dann – Associate Director, Sustainable Finance, ANZ.\nAccess to housing has a huge impact on people’s ability to thrive socially and economically, as well as to feel secure and be part of a local community.\n31\nGovernance\nCorporate Governance Framework\nSHAREHOLDERS\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS\nAudit Committee\nEthics, Environment, Social and Governance Committee\nRisk Committee\nHuman Resources Committee\nDigital Business and Technology Committee\nNomination and Board Operations Committee\nBOARD RESERVED POWERS AND DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY POLICY\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\nGROUP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\n32\nANZ’s strong governance framework provides a solid structure for effective and responsible decision making within the organisation. The Board is responsible for the oversight of ANZ and its sound and prudent management, with specific duties as set out in its Charter available at anz.com/corporategovernance There are six principal Board Committees – the Audit Committee, the Ethics, Environment, Social and Governance Committee, the Risk Committee, the Human Resources Committee, the Digital Business and Technology Committee and the Nomination and Board Operations Committee.

The family started apple farming in 1888 and the business has since evolved into a premium supplier of organic apples, cider and spirits.\nOver the years they have faced many challenges, including bushfires and the collapse of Tasmania’s apple export industry in 1973 (the result of Britain joining the European Common Market). In response, Ian Smith, a third-generation orchardist, built controlled-atmosphere cool stores and began exporting to Asia in How We Creat Value Icons the 1980s.\nMore recently his son Andrew has converted the orchard into an organic farm, in the belief that growing food without the need for chemical fertilisers and pesticides is better for their land, their customers and the Tasmanian environment.\nWillie Smith’s has had a banking relationship with ANZ for more than 100 years. In June this year members of our Board and\nExecutive visited the cider production facilities and packing shed, meeting with the workers and learning about what matters to them and their local community.\n“I have worked hard to evolve Willie Smiths into a vertically integrated agribusiness in the last twenty years. The key ingredients have been innovation, hard work and good relationships. I feel confident and comfortable in our working relationship with ANZ,” said Andrew.\nSupporting the agricultural sector is an important part of ANZ’s history, and banking customers like Willie Smith’s aligns with our focus on helping our customers grow their business sustainably.\nImage: Andrew Smith\n43\nRisk management\nThe successful delivery of the bank’s strategy is dependent on sound risk management. All of the bank’s activities involve – to varying degrees – the analysis, evaluation, acceptance and management of risks or a combination of risks.\nSound risk management plays a critical role in positioning us to prepare for, and respond to, opportunities and challenges in our operating environment.\nOur progress\nThis year we have continued to strengthen our risk management capabilities, focusing on:\nOur Risk Management Framework\nThe Board is responsible for establishing and overseeing the Group’s risk management framework. The Board has delegated authority to the Board Risk Committee (BRC) to develop and monitor compliance with the Group’s risk management policies. The Committee reports regularly to the Board on its activities.\nCulture and conduct • We have initiated a programme of work to build out how we will measure, monitor and manage conduct risk to allow us to better understand and respond to the drivers of poor conduct. This has included introducing new accountability and consequence principles for employees found accountable for material failure and non-compliance as well as recognising positive risk behaviours in our annual performance and remuneration reviews.\nWe have raised employee awareness about our whistleblower processes and made it easier for them to ‘speak up’– including through initiatives such as the inaugural Whistleblower Awareness Week this year. Simplification • Investment has been made in our risk systems, including\nenhancing our data analytics to improve our ability to identify issues, and more swiftly understand the root causes.\nStandardisation and simplification of our wholesale risk practices and policies has helped significantly improve time responsiveness thereby delivering a better banker and customer experience.\nThe key pillars of the Group’s risk management framework include:\nthe Risk Appetite Statement (RAS), which sets out the Board’s expectations regarding the degree of risk that the Group is prepared to accept in pursuing its strategic objectives and its operating plan; and\nthe Risk Management Statement (RMS), which describes the Group’s strategy for managing risks and a summary of the key elements of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) that give effect to that strategy. The RMS includes: a description of each material risk; and an overview of how the RMF addresses each risk, with reference to the relevant policies, standards and procedures. It also includes information on how the Group identifies, measures, evaluates, monitors, reports and then either controls or mitigates material risks. The Group operates a Three Lines-of-Defence Model in regard to risk management that helps embed a culture where risk is everyone’s responsibility. The business – as the first line of defence – has day to day ownership of risks and controls and is accountable for identifying and managing its own risks. The Risk Function is the second line of defence, providing a strong and independent oversight of the work undertaken to manage the risk, as well as developing and maintaining the Risk Management Framework.\nNon-financial risk • We have redesigned our non-financial risk framework in response to feedback that it was too complex. Significant work has been undertaken to simplify our language around operational risk, consolidate our framework documentation, and clarify the requirements and roles and responsibilities of our staff.\nThe final line of defence is Internal Audit and includes independent assurance that evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of both first and second line risk management approaches.\nWe have established a Royal Commission and Self-Assessment Oversight Group to provide oversight of the integrated approach and plans to address the Self-Assessment focus areas and Royal Commission ‘lessons’. This includes, for example, commissioning and reviewing reports on progress in addressing the Self- Assessment focus areas, our 16 Royal Commission commitments and actions by government to respond to the Royal Commission.\n“ Strong risk management is a necessity if we are to anticipate and navigate ANZ through a changing environment.”\nKevin Corbally – Group Chief Risk Officer\nLinks to 2019 Group Performance Framework\nWe continue to operate in a dynamic and challenging external and regulatory environment placing significant demands on the Risk and Compliance function. There were no material breaches of our Group Risk Appetite Statement, and the number of adverse audits fell by a third with management demonstrating accountability for fixing issues in a timely and sustainable manner. While there were many positives from a risk perspective there were some non-financial risk shortcomings from a regulatory, customer and community perspective.\nRefer to the Remuneration Report section of the Annual Report available at anz.com/shareholder/centre for further details.\n44\nFighting financial crime\nFinancial crime threats continue to evolve, as do the regulatory measures required to address them. In response we have:\nThe governance and oversight of risk, whilst embedded in day to day activities, is also the focus of committees and regular forums across the bank (see diagram below). The committees and forums discuss and monitor known and emerging risks, reviewing management plans and monitoring progress to address known issues.\ninvested heavily in capturing and\nunderstanding financial crime data and infrastructure, upgrading sanctions and fraud platforms;\nimplemented a network data analysis tool, improving our ability to collaborate with external parties to fight financial crime; and\nfocused on the growth and development of employees, developing a gap analysis tool to inform our thinking on the current and future capabilities required of our people to combat financial crime.\nThe risk landscape is continually evolving and we are therefore constantly reviewing issues to consider their materiality to the bank’s operations. Two risks we are currently seeking to understand further are:\nCyber security risk: while not new, the increasing reliance we have on information security systems to hold our data and our customers’ data requires us to continually invest in and test the adequacy of our safeguards against evolving cyber attacks and new technology. See page 20 for further detail,\nClimate change risk: the financial risks associated with climate change are subject to increasing prudential and regulatory oversight and are therefore an area of focus for us. See pages 48 to 49 for further detail on our approach to climate-related financial risks.\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS\nEXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ANZ’s most senior executives meet regularly to discuss performance and review shared initiatives\nConsequence Review Group\nKEY MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES\np u o r G\nCredit and Market Risk Committee\nCredit Ratings System Oversight Committee\nGroup Asset and Liability Committee\nCapital and Stress Testing Oversight Committee\nOperational Risk Executive Committee\nEthics and Responsible Business Committee\nInvestment Committee\nRoyal Commission and Self-Assessment Oversight Group\nn o i s i v D\ni\nModelling Ratings Working Groups and Usage Forums\nDivisional Initiatives Review Committees /Project Advisory Councils\nDivisional Risk Management Committees\nVarious Divisional Specific Management Committees\nOperational Risk Committee\nProduct Committee\nDivisional Consequence Review Groups\ny r t n u o C\nRegional or Country Risk Management Committees\nCountry Assets and Liabilities Committees\n45\nRisk management (continued)\nKey material risks\nThe material risks facing the group (as per the Group’s Risk Management Statement) and how these risks are managed, are summarised below:\nRisk Type\nDescription\nManaging the risk\nMost material issues icons\nMaterial ESG issues1\nCapital Adequacy Risk\nThe risk of loss arising from the Group failing to maintain the level of capital required by prudential regulators and other key stakeholders (shareholders, debt investors, depositors, rating agencies, etc.) to support ANZ’s consolidated operations and risk appetite.\nWe pursue an active approach to Capital Management through ongoing review, and Board approval, of the level and composition of our capital base against key policy objectives.\nMost material issues icons\nNew icons/infographics\nMost material issues icons\nCompliance Risk\nThe risk of failure to act in accordance with laws, regulations, industry standards and codes, internal policies and procedures and principles of good governance as applicable to the Group’s businesses.\nKey features of how we manage Compliance Risk as part of our Operational Risk framework include:\ncentralised management of key obligations, and emphasis on identifying changes in regulations and the Most material issues icons business environment, so as to enable us to proactively assess emerging compliance risks and implement robust reporting and certification processes.\ncentralised management of key obligations, and emphasis on identifying changes in regulations and the Most material issues icons business environment, so as to enable us to proactively assess emerging compliance risks and implement robust reporting and certification processes.\nNew icons/infographics\nrecognition of incident management as a separate element to enhance ANZ’s ability to identify, manage and report on incidents/breaches in a timely manner.

For detailed information see ‘ANZ 2019 climate- related financial disclosures’ on anz.com/annualreport.\nFeeding the results of our customer engagement into our assessments of individual customers and carbon-intensive portfolios, in particular the energy, transport, buildings and food, beverage and agricultural sectors\nEngaging with our customers on their transition plans\nThroughout 2019 we have analysed the carbon disclosures of over 80 of our largest emitting customers and engaged with 29 of these to support them to establish, and where appropriate, strengthen existing low carbon transition plans.\nThis engagement will inform the development of a model applicable to our broader customer base enabling us to encourage customers to improve the management and disclosure of their climate-related risks and opportunities.\nWithin each industry our customers have different starting points. Both through customer discussions and reviews of public disclosures we are developing a better understanding of our customers’ preparation for, and management of, their most likely climate-related risks and opportunities. Insights we have gained from these customer conversations include:\nEnergy\nTransport\nBuildings\nFood, beverage and agriculture\nEnergy: our engagement in this sector is initially focused on customers with thermal coal operations. Some customers see continuing strong demand for high-quality, low-cost Australian thermal coal that will be used in recently built or planned high efficiency, lower emissions (HELE) plants across Asia; their strategy is focused on developing high quality thermal coal assets and they are committed to improving their external disclosures. Other customers have undertaken scenario analysis (aligned with TCFD recommendations), revealing that some of their commodities perform worst under a low-carbon transition; in response they are directing limited expenditure to thermal coal and most of this is in maintenance capital rather than expansion. Some companies are also starting to work with their suppliers and customers to seek to reduce the emissions associated with the use of their mining commodities, ie ‘Scope 3’ emissions.\nTransport: a significant customer has ambitious plans to expand their electric vehicle fleet in Australia and is building a new distribution centre that will integrate rooftop solar and electric vehicle charging bays. They also plan to enter a renewable energy power purchase agreement (PPA) to lower their carbon footprint and shield themselves from price volatility.\nBuildings: a number of customers have established net-zero carbon targets that will be achieved largely through improved energy efficiency and onsite solar installations, setting time bound goals to achieve this by 2030.\nFood, beverage and agriculture: for many of our agribusiness and food producers, the physical risks of climate change (e.g., water availability and supply) represent the most material and immediate risk to their business, rather than transition risks. We have observed these customers are increasingly focused on managing climate-related risks by committing to reduce or remove deforestation from their operations and supply chains.\n48\nOur progress on the TCFD\nTCFD theme Our progress to date\nGovernance\nBoard Risk Committee oversees management of\nclimate-related risks\nBoard Ethics, Environment, Social and Governance Committee approves climate-related objectives, goals and targets\nEthics and Responsible Business Committee (executive management) oversees our approach to sustainability and reviews climate-related risks\nStrategy\nANZ’s Climate Change Statement (available on anz.com) reaffirms support for the Paris Agreement goals and transition to a net-zero carbon economy\nManaging the net-zero carbon transition focuses on an orderly and just transition that gives careful consideration to the impacts on communities\nParticipation in a United Nations Environment Program Finance Industry (UNEP FI) working group on TCFD scenario analysis that issued recommendations and methods to assess portfolio transition and physical risks\nLow carbon products and services within our Institutional business focused on climate-related opportunities\nAnalysis of flood-related risks for our home loan portfolio in a major regional location of Australia\nTest-pilot of socio-economic indicators showing financial resilience of home loan customers with respect to flood risk\nRisk management\nClimate change risk added to Group and Institutional Risk Appetite Statements\nClimate change identified as a Principal Risk and Uncertainty in our UK Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTR) Submission\nGuidelines and training provided to over 1,000 of our Institutional bankers on customers’ transition plan discussions\nEnhanced financial analysis and stronger credit approval terms applied to agricultural property purchases in regions of low average rainfall or measured variability\nNew agribusiness customers assessed for financial resilience and understanding of rainfall and climate trends in their area, and water budgets considered if irrigating\nMetrics and targets\nSupport 100 of our largest emitting customers1 to establish or strengthen low carbon transition plans by 2021, with metrics developed to track progress\nExceeded our 5-year $15 billion target to fund and facilitate low carbon and environmentally sustainable solutions\nPower Purchase Agreement to increase renewable energy use in our Australian operations\nOngoing emissions reduction targets for ANZ energy use aligned with the Paris Agreement goals\n1.\nIn the energy, transport, buildings and food, beverage and agricultural sectors.\nFocus areas – 2020/21\nAlign with regulatory\nguidance on climate-related risk governance, including stress testing of selected portfolios\nConsider extending scenario\nanalysis to incorporate bushfire, flood and other risks relating to retail customers\nPossible extension of\nemerging environmental and climate-related risks to other segments of the home loan portfolio\nInclude climate risk reference in agriculture related lending guidance documents used by our front line bankers\nEncouraging customers to develop and disclose their transition plans in key sectors energy, transport, buildings and food, beverage and agriculture\nCustomer engagement to identify customer or sector-specific transition or physical risks\nComplete transition plan engagement with high emitting customers and consider how to integrate into customer assessments\nNew 6-year $50 billion target to fund and facilitate sustainable solutions\nNew metrics for measuring impact of our progress on environmental sustainability\nNew target to procure 100% renewable electricity for ANZ’s operations by 2025\nBeyond 2020 vision\nAn enhanced risk\nmanagement framework that is responsive to climate change, and meets financial regulators’ requirements\nANZ business strategy more closely aligned to a resilient and sustainable economy that supports the Paris Agreement goals and Sustainable Development Goals\nIntegrate assessment of climate-related risks into our Group risk management framework\nStandard discussions with business customers include climate-related risks and opportunities\nAssessment of customer transition plans part of standard lending decisions and portfolio analysis\nMonitor industry\nstandards for lending aligned with the Paris Agreement goals\nReduce ANZ’s\noperational emissions in line with the decarbonisation trajectory of the Paris Agreement goals\n49\n$\nCUSTOMER STORY Sustainable finance market continues to grow\nFollowing the growth of green bonds in the past three to four years, the Australian and New Zealand sustainable finance market continues to accelerate with the emergence of loans in both green and sustainability-linked formats.\nThese loans are differentiated by how the proceeds are used. Green loans require borrowers to invest in ‘green’ assets such as green buildings, renewable energy or low carbon transport projects. Sustainability-linked loans can be used for general corporate purposes with pricing designed to incentivise improved sustainability performance – for example, reducing emissions and improving employee wellbeing.\nIn the past year, ANZ has arranged and funded the first ever sustainability linked loan in Australia for Adelaide Airport, and the first Climate Bonds Initiative certified green loan in Australia for Investa Commercial Property Fund.\nWe also acted as joint sustainability co-ordinator and bookrunner on a $1.4 billion sustainability-linked loan for Sydney Airport – the first syndicated facility of its kind in Australia as well as the largest in Asia Pacific and the airport sector to date. Pricing of the loan is attached to Sydney Airport’s ESG performance, as measured by an independent third party. Sustainability initiatives include investment in electric vehicles, an ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025 and cutting carbon emissions per passenger by 50 percent from 2010 levels by 2025.\nIn a first for the New Zealand market, we also led the successful completion of a NZ$50 million sustainability-linked loan for dairy company Synlait Milk Ltd.\n“Linking our financial arrangements to our ESG performance made perfect sense”, said Nigel Greenwood, Synlait Chief Financial Officer. “It reinforces to our shareholders and stakeholders that we are committed to continuously improving our performance and disclosure, and aligns with our company purpose.”\nANZ expects companies will become more receptive to these types of sustainable finance products as climate change and sustainable development move into the fore of their corporate strategies and risk assessment.\nImages supplied by Synlait Milk Ltd\n50\nIn a first for New Zealand, we led the completion of a NZ$50 million sustainability linked loan for dairy company, Synlait Milk Ltd\n51\n52\nOUR PERFORMANCE (continued)\nOUR PERFORMANCE (continued)\nPerformance Overview\nGROUP PERFORMANCE\nGROUP PERFORMANCE The results of the Group’s operations and financial position are set out on pages 52-64.

ANZ includes the impact on the re-measurement of insurance contracts attributable to changes in market discount rates as an adjustment to statutory profit to remove the volatility attributable to changes in market interest rates which reverts to zero over the life of insurance contracts. With the sale completion of the OnePath Life (NZ) Ltd business, the 2019 financial year includes the reversal of life-to-date cash profit adjustments on the revaluation of policy liabilities sold increasing cash profit by $81 million. The Group enters into economic hedges to manage its interest rate and foreign exchange risk which, in accordance with accounting standards, result in fair value gains and losses being recognised within the Income Statement. ANZ removes the fair value adjustments from cash profit since the profit or loss resulting from the hedge transactions will reverse over time to match with the profit or loss from the economically hedged item as part of cash profit. This includes gains and losses arising from approved classes of derivatives not designated in accounting hedge relationships but which are considered to be economic hedges, including hedges of foreign currency debt issuances and foreign exchange denominated revenue and expense streams, primarily NZD and USD (and USD correlated), as well as ineffectiveness from designated accounting hedges. ANZ entered into a series of structured credit intermediation trades prior to the Global Financial Crisis with eight US financial guarantors. This involved selling credit default swaps (CDSs) as protection over specific debt structures and purchasing CDS protection over the same structures. ANZ has subsequently exited its positions with six US financial guarantors. The remaining two portfolios with a $0.3 billion notional value are being monitored with a view to reducing the exposures when ANZ deems it cost effective relative to the perceived risk associated with a specific trade or counterparty. On 3 January 2017, The Group announced that it had agreed to sell its 20% stake in Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank (SRCB). The impact of SRCB has been treated as an adjustment between statutory profit to cash profit. The rationale being the loss on reclassification to held for sale was expected to be largely offset by the release of reserve gains on sale completion within the 2017 year. The transaction was subsequently completed in the 2018 full year, and the entire impact of the transaction was recognised in cash profit.\n1.

The lower net interest margin reflects growth in lower margin Markets Balance Sheet activities, higher proportionate growth in the lower Institutional business, customer switching to principal and interest in Australia home loans, deposit margin compression and lower earnings on capital, partially offset by the impact of home loans repricing. The increase in average interest earning assets reflects growth in Institutional banking portfolios and home loan growth in the New Zealand division.\nOther operating income decreased $163 million (-3%) largely as the result of net divestment impacts of $198 million, a $120 million decrease in net fee and commission income, and $130 million decrease primarily in other income attributable to realised losses on economic hedges against foreign currency denominated revenue streams (which offset favourable foreign currency translations elsewhere in the Group) and a reduction in income from the lenders mortgage insurance business. This was partially offset by higher Markets other operating income of $154 million, a $79 million increase in share of associate’s profit and a $52 million decrease in customer remediation within other operating income.\nOperating expenses decreased $330 million (-4%) primarily due to an accelerated software amortisation charge in the prior period of $251 million, lower restructuring expenses of $150 million, a reduction in expenses following the sale of OnePath Life (NZ) and Asia Retail and Wealth businesses of $60 million, lower Royal Commission legal costs of $40 million and lower FTE. This was partially offset by higher customer remediation of $182 million within operating expenses, inflation, the impact of foreign currency translation and regulatory compliance spend in New Zealand.\nCredit impairment charges increased $107 million (+16%) largely due to higher collectively assessed credit impairment charges, primarily as a result of the prior period benefitting from the release of temporary economic overlays and a greater number of customer upgrades.\n1.

Key drivers:\nPersonnel expenses increased $7 million (0%) largely driven by higher regulatory compliance spend in the New Zealand division, higher employee leave provisions, wage inflation and the impact of insourcing technology services. This was offset by lower FTE, lower personnel expenses following the sale of OnePath Life (NZ) and the Asia Retail and Wealth businesses ($33 million) and lower customer remediation ($58 million).\nPremises expenses decreased $16 million (-2%) primarily driven by the consolidation of our property footprint.\nTechnology expenses (excluding personnel) decreased $365 million (-19%) largely due to an accelerated amortisation charge in the prior period ($251 million) and the insourcing of technology services.\nRestructuring expenses decreased $150 million (-66%) due to higher spend in the prior period associated with the move to agile ways of working in the Australian Retail and Commercial division and technology function.\nOther expenses increased $194 million (+11%) largely due to higher customer remediation ($240 million), partially offset by lower expenses following the sale of OnePath Life (NZ) and Asia Retail and Wealth businesses ($26 million) and a reduction in Royal Commission legal costs ($40 million).\nOPERATING EXPENSES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ($M) OPERATING EXPENSES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ($M)\n1,706\n1,900\nPersonnel expenses\n227\n77\nPremises expenses\n2019\n2018\nTechnology expenses\nRestructuring expenses\n4,765\n1,534\n1,899\n4,758\nOther expenses\n795\n811\nCredit impairment1\n2019\n2018\nMovt\n(85) 773 688 2,139 337.6 3,443 43.0% 0.75%\nlarge 1% 16% -5% 6% 18%\nCollectively assessed credit impairment charge/(release) ($m) Individually assessed credit impairment charge ($m) Credit impairment charge ($m) Gross impaired assets ($m)2 Credit risk weighted assets ($b) Total allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) ($m) Individually assessed as % of gross impaired assets Collectively assessed as % of credit risk weighted assets3\n17 778 795 2,029 358.1 4,190 40.1% 0.94%\nThe collectively assessed credit impairment charge of $102 million was primarily driven by a $55 million increase in the New Zealand division and a $30 million increase in the Institutional division. The increase in the New Zealand division was primarily due to release of a temporary economic overlay in 2018, followed by a new temporary management overlay in 2019. The increase in the Institutional division was due to a greater number of customer upgrades in the prior period.\n1. Information has been presented on a cash profit from continuing operations basis.

This was partially offset by an increase in the Australia Retail and Commercial division ($57 million) primarily driven by a number of single name impaired loans in the Commercial portfolio.

Net interest margin decreased as a result of home loan mix changes and higher discounting, the impact of the official cash rate decreases on low-rate deposits, regulatory impact on credit card pricing and higher customer remediation, partially offset by home loans re-pricing. Other operating income decreased as the result of higher customer remediation, and lower fee income due to the removal of fees and lower volumes. Operating expenses were flat with higher inflation, higher compliance costs and increased technology infrastructure spend offset by productivity initiatives including workforce and branch optimisation. Credit impairment charges increased primarily due to an increase in collectively assessed credit impairment as a result of a weakening Australian economic outlook, partially offset by a higher recoveries and write-backs.\nInstitutional\nLending volumes grew across all Institutional businesses. Customer deposits grew in Markets and Transaction Banking. Net interest margin decreased due to a reduction in lending margins, partially offset by higher deposit margins. Other operating income increased as a result of higher Markets income across all businesses. Operating expenses decreased due to a reduction in FTE and related costs, and lower ongoing software amortisation charges, partially offset by inflation. Credit impairment charges increased primarily due to an increase in individually assessed impairment charges driven by lower write-backs and recoveries, and an increase in collectively assessed impairment charges as a result of a greater number of customer upgrades in the prior period.\nNew Zealand\nLending and customer deposit volumes grew across all portfolios and funds under management increased during the period. Net interest margin decreased as a result of compressed deposit margins and home loan mix changes. Operating income decreased primarily due to the loss of income as the result of the OnePath Life (NZ) divestment, and an one-off insurance recovery in the prior period. Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher regulatory compliance spend, partly offset by the OnePath Life (NZ) divestment. Credit impairment charges increased primarily due to an increase in individually assessed impairment charges driven by lower write-backs and recoveries, and increase in collectively assessed impairment charges in Commercial driven by the release of an Agri economic cycle adjustment in 2018 followed by a new temporary overlay in 2019.\nPacific\nOperating income for the Pacific division was broadly in line with the prior year. Costs were higher largely due to customer remediation. Credit impairment charges were not significant for the 2019 financial year.\nTSO and Group Centre\nThe 2019 financial year included the gain on sale of OnePath Life (NZ), Paymark, Cambodia JV and PNG Retail, Commercial and SME. The 2018 financial year included the gain on sale of MCC, loss on sale of SRCB, the loss on reclassification of assets and liabilities to held for sale for Cambodia JV, OPL NZ, and PNG Retail, Commercial and SME, Royal Commission legal costs, and higher restructuring costs.\n1. Information has been presented on a cash profit from continuing operations basis. Discontinued operations are detailed on page 61.\n60\n60 ANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nOUR PERFORMANCE (continued)\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nThe financial results of the Wealth Australia businesses being divested and associated Group reclassification and consolidation impacts are treated as discontinued operations from a financial reporting perspective. These businesses qualify as discontinued operations, a subset of assets and liabilities held for sale, as they represent a major line of business.\nThe comparative Group Income Statement and Statement of Comprehensive Income have been restated to show discontinued operations separately from continuing operations in a separate line item ‘Profit/(Loss) from discontinued operations’.\nSale to IOOF Holdings Limited (IOOF)\nOn 17 October 2017, the Group announced it had agreed to sell its OnePath P&I and ADGs businesses to IOOF. The aligned dealer groups business consists of ADGs that operate under their own Australian Financial Services licences. The sale of the ADGs completed on 1 October 2018. On 17 October 2019 the Group announced it had agreed a revised sale price for its OnePath P&I business and ADG to IOOF of $850 million, being a $125 million reduction from the original sale price of $975 million announced in October 2017. The new price of $850 million, includes approximately $25 million that ANZ has already received for the sale of ADGs in October 2018. The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements. Subject to APRA approval the Group expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. The impact of the reduction in price has been reflected in the 2019 financial results.\nSale to Zurich Financial Services Australia (Zurich)\nOn 12 December 2017, ANZ announced that it had agreed to the sale of its life insurance business to Zurich and regulatory approval was obtained on 10 October 2018. The transaction was completed on 31 May 2019.\nIncluded in the ‘Cash loss from discontinued operations’ is:\nA $23 million loss ($81 million loss after tax) was recognised in the 2019 financial year. This is attributable to sale related adjustments and write-downs, the reversal of the life-to-date cash profit adjustments on the revaluation of policy liabilities sold to Zurich, partially offset by the recycling of gains previously deferred in equity reserves on sale completion. A $632 million loss (pre and post-tax) was recognised on the reclassification of Wealth Australia businesses to held for sale in the 2018 financial year; and\nCustomer remediation which includes provisions for expected refunds to customers and related remediation costs associated with inappropriate advice or services not provided in the pensions and investments and life insurance businesses. An amount of $241 million pre-tax, $207 million post tax was recognised in the 2019 financial year (2018: $181m pre-tax, $127 million post-tax).\nANZ’s lenders mortgage insurance, share investing, general insurance distribution and financial planning businesses which were previously part of the continuing operations of Wealth Australia now form part of the Australia Retail and Commercial division (previously named Australia division) and Wealth Australia ceases to exist as a continuing division.\nExplanation of adjustments between statutory profit and cash profit\nTreasury shares adjustment\nANZ shares held by the Group in Wealth Australia discontinued operations are deemed to be Treasury shares for accounting purposes. Dividends and realised and unrealised gains and losses from these shares are reversed as they are not permitted to be recognised as income for statutory reporting purposes. In deriving cash profit, these earnings are included to ensure there is no asymmetrical impact on the Group’s profits because the Treasury shares are held to support policy liabilities which are revalued through the Income Statement. With the sale completion of the life insurance business to Zurich, there are no further ANZ shares held by the Group in discontinued operations (2018: 15.5 million shares).\nRevaluation of policy liabilities\nWhen calculating policy liabilities, the projected future cash flows on insurance contracts are discounted to reflect the present value of the obligation, with the impact of changes in the market discount rate in each period being reflected in the Income Statement. ANZ includes the impact on the re-measurement of the insurance contract attributable to changes in market discount rates as an adjustment to statutory profit to remove the volatility attributable to changes in market interest rates which reverts to zero over the life of the insurance contract. With the sale completion of the life insurance business to Zurich, the 2019 financial year includes the reversal of the life-to-date cash profit adjustments on the revaluation of policy liabilities sold, reducing cash profit by $15 million.\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\nStatutory profit/(loss) from discontinued operations\n(343)\n(695)\nAdjustments between statutory profit and cash profit\n34\n13\nTreasury shares adjustment Revaluation of policy liabilities\n(11) 45\n7 6\nCash profit/(loss) from discontinued operations\n(309)\n(682)\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT 61\n61\nOUR PERFORMANCE (continued)\nFINANCIAL POSITION OF THE GROUP – INCLUDING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nCondensed balance sheet\nAs at\n2019 $b\n2018 $b\nMovt\nAssets\nCash / Settlement balances owed to ANZ / Collateral paid Trading and investment securities/available-for-sale assets 1 Derivative financial instruments\n100.3\n126.9\n120.7\n98.0\n112.0\n68.4\n2%\n13%\n76%\nNet loans and advances\n615.3\n604.5\n2%\nAssets held for sale\n1.8\n45.2\n96%\nOther\n16.1\n15.1\n7%\nTotal assets\n981.1\n943.2\n4%\nLiabilities\nSettlement balances owed by ANZ / Collateral received\n18.8\n18.3\n3%\nDeposits and other borrowings\n637.7\n618.2\n3%\nDerivative financial instruments\n121.0\n69.7\n74%\nDebt Issuances\n129.7\n121.2\n7%\nLiabilities held for sale\n2.1\n47.2\n96%\nOther\n11.0\n9.2\n20%\nTotal liabilities\n920.3\n883.8\n4%\nTotal equity\n60.8\n59.4\n2%\n1.\nOn adoption of AASB 9 on 1 October 2018, the classification and measurement of financial assets were revised.

Cash earnings and divestments were offset by the impact of dividends and share buybacks during the year.\nDividends This performance allowed us to propose that a final dividend of 80 cents be paid on each eligible fully paid ANZ ordinary share, bringing the total dividend for the year ended 30 September 2019 to $1.60 per share. This represents a dividend payout ratio of 70.1% of cash profit from continuing operations.\nThe proposed 2019 final dividend of 80 cents per share will be 70% franked for Australian taxation purposes, and carry a New Zealand (NZ) imputation credits of NZD 9 cents per ordinary share.

The full Remuneration Report is contained in the Annual Report from page 66 onwards, which includes details of our remuneration strategy and framework and the remuneration practices that apply to KMP. The report can be accessed via the ANZ website at anz.com/annualreport.\nNON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION The Board reviewed NED fees for 2019 and determined once again not to increase their fees (which remain unchanged from 2016). As disclosed in last year’s Remuneration Report, the NEDs who served on the Board in 2018 agreed to a 20% reduction of their Board fee for 2019 (20% reduction to the Chairman fee from $825,000 to $660,000, and 20% reduction to the NED member fee from $240,000 to $192,000) as a consequence for the shared accountability for the failures highlighted by the 2018 Royal Commission.\n2019 STATUTORY REMUNERATION - NEDS\nFinancial year\nSHORT-TERM NED BENEFITS\nFees1 $\nNon monetary benefits $\nPOST-EMPLOYMENT Super contributions1 $\nTotal remuneration2 $\nCurrent Non-Executive Directors\nD Gonski\n2019\n639,351\n\n20,649\n660,000\n2018\n804,831\n\n20,169\n825,000\nI Atlas\n2019\n275,851\n\n20,649\n296,500\n2018\n324,331\n\n20,169\n344,500\nP Dwyer\n2019\n296,351\n\n20,649\n317,000\n2018\n344,831\n\n20,169\n365,000\nJ Halton\n2019\n246,058\n\n20,649\n266,707\n2018\n277,567\n\n20,169\n297,736\nJ Key3\n2019\n229,131\n\n20,649\n249,780\n2018\n148,546\n\n11,996\n160,542\nG Liebelt\n2019\n294,851\n\n20,649\n315,500\n2018\n345,858\n\n20,169\n366,027\nJ Macfarlane\n2019\n249,851\n\n20,649\n270,500\n2018\n298,331\n\n20,169\n318,500\nFormer Non-Executive Director\nH Lee4\n2019\n57,258\n4,832\n5,133\n67,223\n2018\n314,831\n\n20,169\n335,000\nTotal of all Non-Executive Directors\n2019\n2,288,702\n4,832\n149,676\n2,443,210\n2018\n2,859,126\n\n153,179\n3,012,305\n1.

Long-term benefits and share-based payments do not apply for the NEDs. 3.\nJ Key commenced as a NED for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZBGL) on 28 February 2018, so 2018 remuneration reflects a partial service year. In addition for 2018, in relation to his Non-Executive Directorship from 18 October 2017 for ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited, J Key also received a total of NZD 302,925 as a NED until 31 December 2017 and from 1 January 2018 as Chairman. In 2019, J Key also received a total of NZD 382,950 as Chairman for ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited.\n4. H Lee retired as a NED on 19 December 2018, so 2019 remuneration reflects partial service year up to his date of retirement.

The Company consists of the following operations undertaken in Australia and in its overseas branches:\nRetail and Commercial operations,\nInstitutional operations, and\nTechnology Services & Operations and Group Centre operations\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group can be found as part of the 2019 Annual Report at https//shareholder.anz.com/annual-report- shareholder-review and copies are available from the Company’s registered office and principal place of business.\nWe present these financial statements in Australian dollars, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. We have rounded values to the nearest million dollars ($m), unless otherwise stated, as allowed under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors Report) Instrument 2016/191.\nBASIS OF MEASUREMENT\nWe have prepared the financial information in accordance with the historical cost basis - except the following assets and liabilities which we have stated at their fair value:\nderivative financial instruments and in the case of fair value hedging, a fair value adjustment is made on the underlying hedging exposure;\nfinancial instruments held for trading;\nfinancial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss;\navailable-for-sale financial assets (prior to 1 October 2018); and\nfinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (applicable from 1 October 2018);\nIn accordance with AASB 119 Employee Benefits defined benefit obligations are measured using the Projected Unit Credit Method.\n8\n1. ABOUT THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\nTRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES Foreign currency transactions are translated into the relevant functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Australian dollars, being the functional currency, at the relevant spot rate. Any foreign currency translation gains or losses are included in profit or loss in the period they arise.\nWe measure translation differences on non-monetary items at fair value through profit or loss and report them as part of the fair value gain or loss on these items. We include any translation differences on non-monetary items classified as investment securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (applicable from 1 October 2018) and non-monetary items classified as available-for-sale financial assets in the available-for- sale revaluation reserve in equity (applicable prior to 1 October 2018).\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nWhen applying accounting policies, management has made a number of judgements and applied estimates and assumptions about past and future events. Further information on the key judgements and estimates that we consider material to the financial statements are contained within the relevant notes to the financial statements.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED IN THE PERIOD\nAASB 9 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (AASB 9)\nThe Company has applied AASB 9 effective from 1 October 2018 (with the exception of the ‘own credit’ requirements relating to financial liabilities designated as measured at fair value, which were early adopted by the Company effective from 1 October 2013). In addition, the Company chose to early adopt AASB 2017-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (AASB 2017-6) effective from 1 October 2018. AASB 9 provides an accounting policy choice, which the Company has taken in the current period, to continue to apply the AASB 139 hedge accounting requirements until the International Accounting Standards Board’s ongoing project on macro hedge accounting is completed.\nAASB 9 and AASB 2017-6 stipulate new requirements for the impairment of financial assets, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and general hedge accounting. Details of the key requirements are outlined within the Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities sections in following notes, and a reconciliation of the transitional impact of adopting the standard at 1 October 2018 is set out in Note 31.\nAASB 15 REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (AASB 15)\nThe Company adopted AASB 15 from 1 October 2018 which resulted in changes in accounting policies. The standard requires identification of distinct performance obligations within a contract, and allocation of the transaction price of the contract to those performance obligations. Revenue is then recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied. The standard also provides guidance on whether an entity is acting as a principal or an agent which impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis. In accordance with the transitional provisions of AASB 15, the Company has adopted the full retrospective transition approach. Under this approach, the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard has been recognised as an adjustment to opening retained earnings as at 1 October 2017 and comparative information for the 2018 reporting period has been restated.\nThe adoption of AASB 15 resulted in the following changes in accounting policy:\nRecognition of trail commission revenue: trail commission revenue previously recognised over time is now recognised at the time the Company initially distributes the underlying product to the customer where it is highly probable the revenue will not need to be reversed in future periods.\nThis policy change resulted in an increase to the opening balances of Other assets $32 million, Deferred tax liabilities $10 million and Retained earnings $22 million as at 1 October 2017 to recognise revenue that qualifies for upfront recognition under AASB 15 but was not previously recognised under AASB 118 Revenue (AASB 118). The change did not impact net profit or earnings per share in the comparative periods.\nPresentation: Certain credit card loyalty costs and other costs will be presented as operating expenses where the Company has assessed that it is acting as principal (rather than an agent). Previously these costs were presented as a reduction of other operating income. In addition, certain incentives received from card scheme providers related to card marketing activities will be presented as operating income where the Company has assessed that it is acting as principal (rather than an agent). Previously these incentives were presented as a reduction of operating expenses. The presentation of these costs under AASB 15 increased other operating income and operating expenses by $146 million in 2018. The changes did not impact net profit or earnings per share in the comparative periods.\n9\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n1. ABOUT THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT EARLY ADOPTED\nA number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been published but are not mandatory for the financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2019, and have not been applied by the Company in preparing these financial statements. Further details of these are set out below.\nGENERAL HEDGE ACCOUNTING\nAASB 9 introduces new hedge accounting requirements which more closely align accounting with risk management activities undertaken when hedging financial and non-financial risks.\nAASB 9 provides the Company with an accounting policy choice to continue to apply the AASB 139 hedge accounting requirements until the International Accounting Standards Board’s ongoing project on macro hedge accounting is completed. The Company currently applies the hedge accounting requirements of AASB 139.\nAASB 16 LEASES (AASB 16)\nAASB 16 is effective for the Company from 1 October 2019 and replaces the previous standard AASB 117 Leases (AASB 117). AASB 16 primarily impacts the Company’s property and technology leases which were previously classified as operating leases. Under AASB 117, operating leases were not recognised on balance sheet and rent payments were expensed over the lease term.\nUnder AASB 16, lessees must recognise all leases (except for lease of low value assets and short term leases) on balance sheet under a single accounting model. Accordingly, the Company will recognise its right to use an underlying leased asset over the lease term as a right-of-use (ROU) asset, and its obligation to make lease payments as a lease liability. In the income statement, the Company will recognise depreciation expense on the ROU asset and interest expense on the lease liability. As a result, lease expenses will be higher in the early periods of a lease and lower in the later periods of the lease compared to the previous standard where expenses were constant over the lease term. Cumulative expenses over the life of a lease will not change.\nThe Company will apply the modified retrospective transition approach whereby initial lease liabilities are recognised based on the present value of remaining lease payments as of the transition date. The initial ROU asset recognised for certain large commercial and retail leases will be measured as if AASB 16 had always been applied to the leases. For all other leases, the initial ROU asset will be measured as equal to the initial lease liability. Based on this transition approach, the Company expects to recognise an increase in liabilities of $2.2 billion and an increase in assets of $2.1 billion. This is expected to result in a reduction to opening retained earnings of $66 million and an increase in deferred tax assets of $37 million as of 1 October 2019. Comparative information from prior periods will not be restated.\nThe implementation of AASB 16 requires management to make certain key judgements including the determination of lease terms, discount rates and identifying arrangements that contain a lease. These estimates may be refined as the Company finalises its implementation of the standard in the first half of the 2020 financial year.\nAASB 17 INSURANCE CONTRACTS (AASB 17)\nThe final version of AASB 17 was issued in July 2017 and is not effective for the Company until 1 October 2021. It will replace AASB 4 Insurance Contracts, AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts and AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts. AASB 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts.\nThe measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements under AASB 17 are significantly different from current accounting standards. Although the overall profit recognised in respect of insurance contracts will not change, it is expected that the timing of profit recognition will change.\nThe impact of AASB 17 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company.\nAASB INTERPRETATION 23 UNCERTAINTY OVER INCOME TAX TREATMENTS (INTERPRETATION 23)\nIn July 2017 the AASB issued Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments. The Interpretation clarifies application of recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12 Income Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments.\nInterpretation 23 will apply to the Company from 1 October 2019, and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company.\nREVISED CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK\nIn June 2019 the AASB issued a revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting. The new Framework includes updated definitions and criteria for the recognition and derecognition of assets and liabilities. Additionally it introduces new concepts on measurement, including factors to consider when selecting a measurement basis. The revised Conceptual Framework will apply to the Company from 1 October 2020 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company.\n10\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\n1. ABOUT THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT EARLY ADOPTED (continued)\nINTEREST RATE BENCHMARK REFORM\nInterbank offered rates (IBORs), such as LIBOR, are a key reference rate for derivatives, loans and securities for global financial markets. In response to concerns about the transparency and liquidity of IBOR rates, regulators in a number of jurisdictions across the globe are well advanced in developing benchmark rates to phase out and replace IBORs, these projects are collectively known as ‘IBOR Reform’. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is also considering the financial reporting implications of IBOR reform which is expected to impact elements of financial instrument accounting, including hedge accounting, loan modifications, fair value methodologies and disclosures.\nThe IASB project is split into two phases: Phase 1 deals with pre-replacement issues (issues affecting financial reporting in the period before the replacement of IBOR’s); and Phase 2 deals with replacement issues (issues affecting financial reporting when existing IBOR’s are replaced).\nIn September 2019, the IASB issued a final standard, Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 which focuses on ‘pre-rate replacement issues’ and provides exceptions to specific hedge accounting requirements under IAS 39 and IFRS 9 so that entities will be able to apply those hedge accounting requirements under an assumption that the interest rate benchmark is not altered as a result of the interest rate benchmark reform. In October 2019, AASB adopted these amendments in AASB 2019-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform.\nAlthough the Company anticipates the new standard, once adopted, will provide certain relief in relation to hedge accounting requirements, for 30 September 2019 reporting purposes, it has considered the existing portfolio of hedge accounted relationships in light of:\n\nthe significant uncertainty surrounding the method and timing of transition away from IBORs; and\nongoing application and reliance in capital markets on IBOR’s for financial instrument pricing.\nAs result of the above factors, the Company has concluded that continuation of hedge accounting relationships for potentially impacted hedge relationship remains appropriate.\nThe Company is considering the new standard which is effective on 1 October 2020 but may be adopted earlier.\n11\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n2.

OPERATING INCOME (continued)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nNET INTEREST INCOME Interest Income and Expense We recognise interest income and expense for all financial instruments, including those classified as held for trading, assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (applicable from 1 October 2018), available-for-sale assets (applicable prior to 1 October 2018) or designated at fair value, through profit or loss in net interest income. For assets held at amortised cost, the Company uses the effective interest rate method to calculate amortised cost. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the stream of estimated future cash receipts or payments over the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. For assets subject to prepayment, we determine their expected life on the basis of historical behaviour of the particular asset portfolio - taking into account contractual obligations and prepayment experience.\nWe recognise fees and costs, which form an integral part of the financial instrument (for example loan origination fees and costs), using the effective interest method. This is presented as part of interest income or expense depending on whether the underlying financial instrument is a financial asset or financial liability.\nMajor Bank Levy The Major Bank Levy Act 2017 (‘Levy’ or ‘Major bank levy’) applies a rate of 0.06% to certain liabilities of the Company. The Company has determined that the levy represents a finance cost for the Company and $363 million (2018: $355 million) is presented in interest expense in the Income Statement.\nOTHER OPERATING INCOME Fee and Commission Revenue We recognise fee and commission revenue arising from contracts with customers: (a) over time when the performance obligation is satisfied across more than one reporting period or (b) at a point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied immediately or is satisfied within one reporting period.\nLending fees exclude fees treated as part of the effective yield calculation of interest income. Lending fees include certain guarantee and commitment fees where the loan or guarantee is not likely to be drawn upon and other fees charged for providing customers a distinct good or service that are recognised separately from the underlying lending product (including annual package fees that provide benefits on other ANZ products).\nNon lending fees includes fees associated with deposit and credit card accounts, interchange fees and fees charged for specific customer transactions such as international money transfers. Where the Company provides multiple goods or services to a customer under the same contract, the Company allocates the transaction price of the contract to those performance obligations based on the relative stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation. Revenue is recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied.\nCommissions represent fees from third parties where ANZ acts as an agent by arranging a third party (e.g. an insurance provider) to provide goods and services to a customer. In such cases, ANZ is not primarily responsible for providing the underlying good or service to the customer. If the Company collects funds on behalf of a third party when acting as an agent, the Company only recognises the net commission it retains as revenue. When the commission is variable based on factors outside the control of the Company (e.g. a trail commission), revenue is only recognised if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of the variable amount will not be required in future periods.\nFunds management income represent fees earned from customers for providing financial advice and fees for asset management services and advice provided to investment funds. Revenue is recognised either at the point the financial advice is provided or over the period in which the asset management services are delivered. Performance fees associated with funds management activities are only recognised when it becomes highly probable the performance hurdle will be achieved.\nNet Foreign Exchange Earnings and Other Financial Instruments Income We recognise the following as net foreign exchange earnings and other financial instruments income:\nexchange rate differences arising on the settlement of monetary items and translation differences on monetary items translated at rates different to those at which they were initially recognised or included in a previous financial report;\nfair value movements (excluding realised and accrued interest) on derivatives that we use to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk on funding instruments not designated as accounting hedges;\n13\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n2. OPERATING INCOME (continued)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nthe ineffective portions of fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges;\nimmediately upon sale or repayment of a hedged item, the unamortised fair value adjustments in items designated as fair value hedges and amounts accumulated in equity related to designated cash flow hedges.\nfair value movements on financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss or held for trading;\namounts released from the Available For Sale (AFS) revaluation reserve (applicable prior to 1 October 2018) when an available-for-sale asset is sold;\namounts released from the FVOCI reserve (applicable from 1 October 2018) when a debt instrument classified as measured at FVOCI is sold;\nthe gain or loss on derecognition of financial assets or liabilities measured at amortised cost.\nDividends Received from Controlled Entities Dividends are recognised as revenue when the right to receive payment is established.\nGain or Loss on Disposal of Non-Financial Assets The gain or loss on the disposal of assets is the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the proceeds of disposal net of costs. This is recognised in other income in the year in which the significant risks and rewards transfer to the buyer.\nSHARE OF ASSOCIATES’ PROFIT The equity method is applied to accounting for associates. Under the equity method the Company’s share of the after tax results of associates is included in the Income Statement and the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\nNET INCOME FROM INSURANCE BUSINESS We recognise:\npremiums received (net of reinsurance premiums paid) are recognised based on an assessment of the likely pattern in which risk will emerge over the term of the policies written. This assessment is undertaken periodically and updated in accordance with the latest pattern of risk emergence; and\nclaims incurred are recognised net of reinsurance, on an accruals basis once the liability to the policy owner has been established under the terms of the contract and through actuarial assumptions of future claims.\n14\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n3.

Comparative information has been restated accordingly which increased total operating expense by $146 million for 2018.\n2. Includes customer remediation expenses of $380 million for 2019 (2018: $255million). 3. 2018 includes an accelerated amortisation expense of $240 million.\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nOPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses are recognised as services are provided to the Company over the period in which an asset is consumed or once a liability is created.\nSALARIES AND RELATED COSTS - ANNUAL LEAVE, LONG SERVICE LEAVE AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Wages and salaries, annual leave, and other employee entitlements expected to be paid or settled within twelve months of employees rendering service are measured at their nominal amounts using remuneration rates that the Company expects to pay when the liabilities are settled.\nWe accrue employee entitlements relating to long service leave using an actuarial calculation. It includes assumptions regarding staff departures, leave utilisation and future salary increases. The result is then discounted using market yields at the reporting date. The market yields are determined from a blended rate of high quality corporate bonds with terms to maturity that closely match the estimated future cash outflows.\nIf we expect to pay short term cash bonuses, then a liability is recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount (as a result of past service provided by the employee) and the obligation can be reliably measured.\n15\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n3. OPERATING EXPENSES (continued)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nPersonnel expenses also include share-based payments which may be cash or equity settled. We calculate the fair value of equity settled remuneration at grant date, which is then amortised over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in share capital or the share option reserve as applicable. When we estimate the fair value, we take into account market vesting conditions, such as share price performance conditions. We take non-market vesting conditions, such as service conditions, into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the expense.\nAfter the grant of an equity-based award, the amount we recognise as an expense is reversed when non-market vesting conditions are not met, for example an employee fails to satisfy the minimum service period specified in the award on resignation, termination or notice of dismissal for serious misconduct. However, we do not reverse the expense if the award does not vest due to the failure to meet a market- based performance condition.\nFurther information on share-based payment schemes operated by the Company during the current and prior year is included in Note 27 Employee Share and Option Plans.\n16\n4.

INCOME TAX (continued)\nTAX CONSOLIDATION\nThe Company and all its wholly owned Australian resident entities are part of a tax-consolidated group under Australian taxation law. The Company is the head entity in the tax-consolidated group. We recognise each of the following in the separate financial statements of members of the tax consolidated group on a ‘group allocation’ basis: tax expense/income, and deferred tax liabilities/assets, that arise from temporary differences of the members of the tax-consolidated group. The Company (as head entity in the tax-consolidated group) recognises current tax liabilities and assets of the tax-consolidated group.\nUnder a tax funding arrangement between the entities in the tax consolidated group, amounts are recognised as payable to or receivable by the Company and each member of the tax-consolidated group in relation to the tax contribution amounts paid or payable between the Company and the other members of the tax-consolidated group.\nMembers of the tax-consolidated group have also entered into a tax sharing agreement that provides for the allocation of income tax liabilities between the entities were the head entity to default on its income tax payment obligations.\nUNRECOGNISED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nUnrecognised deferred tax assets related to unused realised tax losses (on revenue account) total $6 million (2018: $nil). Unrecognised deferred tax liabilities related to additional potential foreign tax costs (assuming all retained earnings in offshore branches are repatriated) total $13 million (2018: $10 million).\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nINCOME TAX EXPENSE Income tax expense comprises both current and deferred taxes and is based on the accounting profit adjusted for differences in the accounting and tax treatments of income and expenses (that is, taxable income). We recognise tax expense in profit or loss except to the extent to which it relates to items recognised directly in equity and other comprehensive income, in which case we recognise it directly in equity or other comprehensive income respectively.\nCURRENT TAX EXPENSE Current tax is the tax we expect to pay on taxable income for the year, based on tax rates (and tax laws) which are enacted at the reporting date. We recognise current tax as a liability (or asset) to the extent that it is unpaid (or refundable).\nDEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES We account for deferred tax using the balance sheet method. Deferred tax arises because accounting income is not always the same as the taxable income. This creates temporary differences, which usually reverse over time. Until they reverse, we recognise a deferred tax asset, or liability, on the balance sheet. We measure deferred taxes at the tax rates that we expect will apply to the period(s) when the asset is realised, or the liability settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date.\nWe offset current and deferred tax assets and liabilities only to the extent that:\n\nthey relate to income taxes imposed by the same taxation authority;\n\nthere is a legal right and intention to settle on a net basis; and\n\nit is allowed under the tax law of the relevant jurisdiction.\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nJudgement is required in determining provisions held in respect of uncertain tax positions. The Company estimates its tax liabilities based on its understanding of the relevant law in each of the countries in which it operates and seeks independent advice where appropriate.\n18\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n5.

Eligible shareholders can elect to forgo their dividend entitlement and instead receive ANZ ordinary shares under the Company’s Bonus Option Plan (BOP). For the 2019 final dividend, DRP participation will be satisfied by an on-market purchase of shares and BOP participation will be satisfied by an issue of ANZ ordinary shares. There will be no discount applied to the DRP and BOP price.\nSee Note 21 Shareholders’ Equity for details of shares the Company issued or purchased in respect of the DRP and BOP.\nDIVIDEND FRANKING ACCOUNT\nCurrency\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\nAustralian franking credits available at 30% tax rate\nAUD\n35\n97\nNew Zealand imputation credits available (which can be attached to our Australian dividends but may only be used by New Zealand resident shareholders)\nNZD\n4,068\n3,868\nThe above amounts represent the balances of the franking accounts as at the end of the financial year, adjusted for:\nfranking credits that will arise from the payment of income tax payable as at the end of the financial year; and\nfranking credits/debits from the receipt/payment of dividends that have been recognised as tax receivables/payables as at the end of the financial year.\n19\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n5. DIVIDENDS (continued)\nThe proposed final 2019 dividend will utilise the entire balance of $35 million franking credits available at 30 September 2019. Instalment tax payments on account of the 2020 financial year which will be made after 30 September 2019 will generate sufficient franking credits to enable the final 2019 dividend to be fully franked. The extent to which future dividends will be franked will depend on a number of factors, including the level of profits generated by the Company that will be subject to tax in Australia.\nRESTRICTIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS\nAPRA’s written approval is required before paying dividends on ANZ ordinary shares:\nif the aggregate dividends exceed the Company’s after tax earnings (in calculating those after tax earnings, we take into account any payments we made on senior capital instruments) in the financial year to which they relate; or\nif the Group’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio falls within capital range buffers specified by APRA.\nIf the Company fails to pay a dividend or distribution on its ANZ Capital Notes or ANZ Capital Securities on the scheduled payment date, it may (subject to a number of exceptions) be restricted from resolving to pay or paying any dividend on the ANZ ordinary shares.\n6. SEGMENT REPORTING\nNo operating segment disclosures have been presented in these Company financial statements. Disaggregated information for the Company’s segments is not information which is regularly provided to the Chief Executive Officer, who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) of the Company.\nFull details of the operating segments of the Group are provided in Note 7 Segment Reporting in the ANZ 2019 Group Annual Report located at https://shareholder.anz.com/annual-report-shareholder-review.\nFINANCIAL ASSETS\nOutlined below is a description of how we classify and measure financial assets relevant to the subsequent note disclosures.\nCLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT\nFinancial assets - general\nThere are three measurement classifications for financial assets under AASB 9: amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Financial assets are classified into these measurement classifications on the basis of two criteria:\nthe business model within which the financial asset is managed; and  the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset (specifically whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest).\nThe resultant financial asset classifications are as follows:\nAmortised cost: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest only and which are held in a business model whose objective is to collect their cash flows;\nFVOCI: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest only and which are held in a business model whose objective is to collect their cash flows or to sell the assets; and\nFVTPL: Any other financial assets not falling into the categories above are measured at FVTPL.\nFair Value Option for Financial Assets\nA financial asset may be irrevocably designated FVTPL on initial recognition when the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\n20\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n7.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS – DESIGNATED IN HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS\nThere are three types of hedge accounting relationships the Company utilises:\nFair value hedge\nCash flow hedge\nNet investment hedge\nObjective of this hedging arrangement\nTo hedge our exposure to changes to the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or unrecognised firm commitment caused by interest rate or foreign currency movements.\nTo hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, a firm commitment or a highly probable forecast transaction caused by interest rate, foreign currency and other price movements.\nTo hedge our exposure to exchange rate differences arising from the translation of our foreign operations from their functional currency to Australian dollars.\nRecognition of effective hedge portion\nThe following are recognised in profit or loss at the same time:\nall changes in the fair value of the underlying item relating to the hedged risk; and the change in the fair value of derivatives.\n\nWe recognise the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge in the cash flow hedge reserve.\nWe recognise the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument in the foreign currency translation reserve.\nRecognition of ineffective hedge portion\nRecognised immediately in Other operating income.\nIf a hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated, or exercised; or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting\nWhen we recognise the hedged item in profit or loss, we recognise the related unamortised fair value adjustment in profit or loss. This may occur over time if the hedged item is amortised to profit or loss as part of the effective yield over the period to maturity.\nOnly when we recognise the hedged item in profit or loss is the amount previously deferred in the cash flow hedge reserve transferred to profit or loss.\nThe amount we defer in the foreign currency translation reserve remains in equity and is transferred to profit or loss only when we dispose of, or partially dispose of, the foreign operation.\nHedged item sold or repaid\nWe recognise the unamortised fair value adjustment immediately in profit or loss.\nAmounts accumulated in equity are transferred immediately to profit or loss.\nThe gain or loss, or applicable proportion, we recognise in equity is transferred to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of a foreign operation.\nAs outlined in Note 1, ANZ has continued to apply the AASB 139 hedge accounting requirements until the International Accounting Standards Board’s ongoing project on macro hedge accounting is completed. However, new hedge disclosures are required for 2019 and onwards under AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (AASB 7) which are presented below.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nRecognition\nInitially and at each reporting date, we recognise all derivatives at fair value. If the fair value of a derivative is positive, then we carry it as an asset, but if its value is negative, then we carry it as a liability.\nValuation adjustments are integral in determining the fair value of derivatives. This includes:\n\na credit valuation adjustment (CVA) to reflect the counterparty risk and/or event of default; and a funding valuation adjustment (FVA) to account for funding costs and benefits in the derivatives portfolio.\nDerecognition of assets and liabilities\nWe remove derivative assets from our balance sheet when the contracts expire or we have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. We remove derivative liabilities from our balance sheet when the Company’s contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.\nImpact on the Income Statement\nHow we recognise gains or losses on derivative financial instruments depends on whether the derivative is held for trading or is designated into a hedging relationship. For derivative financial instruments held for trading, gains or losses from changes in the fair value are recognised in profit or loss.\nFor an instrument designated into a hedging relationship the recognition of gains or losses depends on the nature of the item being hedged. Refer to the table on page 24 for profit or loss treatment depending on the hedge type.\nSources of hedge ineffectiveness may arise from basis risk and differences in discounting between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The hedging instruments are discounted using Overnight Index Swaps discount curves which are not applied to the hedged items.\nHedge effectiveness\nTo qualify for hedge accounting a hedge is expected to be highly effective. A hedge is highly effective only if the following conditions are met:\n\n\nthe hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the period for which the hedge is designated (prospective effectiveness); and the actual results of the hedge are within the range of 80-125% (retrospective effectiveness).\nThe Company monitors hedge effectiveness on a regular basis but at a minimum at least at each reporting date.\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nJudgement is required when we select the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of derivatives, particularly the selection of valuation inputs that are not readily observable, and the application of valuation adjustments to certain derivatives.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES (continuing)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nPolicy applicable from 1 October 2018\nInvestment securities are those financial assets in security form (i.e. transferable debt or equity instruments) that are not held for trading purposes. By way of exception, bills of exchange (a form of security/transferable instrument) which are used to facilitate the Bank’s customer lending activities are classified as Loans and advances (rather than Investment Securities) to better reflect the substance of the arrangement.\nNon-traded equity investments may be designated at FVOCI on an instrument by instrument basis. If this election is made, gains or losses are not reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss on disposal of the investment. However, gains or losses may be reclassified within equity.\nAssets disclosed as investment securities are subject to the general classification and measurement policy for Financial Assets outlined at the commencement of the Company’s financial asset disclosures on page 20. Additionally, expected credit losses associated with “Investment securities - debt securities at amortised cost” and “Investment securities - debt securities at fair value through comprehensive income” are recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting policy outlined in Note 12. For “Investment securities – debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income” the allowance for ECL is recognised in the FVOCI reserve in equity with a corresponding charge to profit or loss.\nPolicy applicable prior to 1 October 2018\nAvailable for sale (AFS) assets comprise non-derivative financial assets which we designate as AFS since we do not hold them principally for trading purposes. They include both equity and debt securities. AFS assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and are revalued at least bi-annually. On revaluation, we include movements in fair value within the available-for-sale revaluation reserve in equity, except for certain items which are recognised directly in profit or loss, being interest on debt securities, dividends received, foreign exchange on debt securities and impairment charges.\nWhen we sell the asset, any cumulative gain or loss from the available-for-sale revaluation reserve is recognised in profit or loss.\nAt each reporting date, we assess whether any AFS assets are impaired. We assess the impairment of any debt securities if an event has occurred which will have a negative impact on the asset’s estimated cash flows. For equity securities, we assess if there is a significant or prolonged decline in their fair value below cost.\nIf an AFS asset is impaired, then we remove the cumulative loss related to that asset from the available-for-sale revaluation reserve. We then recognise it in profit or loss for:\ndebt instruments, as a credit impairment expense; and  equity instruments, as a negative impact in other operating income.\nWe recognise any later reversals of impairment on debt securities in the profit or loss through the credit impairment charge line. However, we do not make any reversals of impairment for equity securities.

Subsequently, we then measure loans and advances at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, net of any provision for credit impairment, or at fair value when they are specifically designated on initial recognition as fair value through profit or loss or when held for trading.\nWe classify contracts to lease assets and hire purchase agreements as finance leases if they transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the customer or an unrelated third party. We include these facilities in ‘Other’ in the table above.\nThe Company enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets that are recognised on its balance sheet. When the Company retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets then the transferred assets remain on the Company’s balance sheet, however, if substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred then the Company derecognises the asset.\nIf the risks and rewards are partially retained and control over the asset is lost, then the Company derecognises the asset. If control over the asset is not lost, the Company continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement.\nWe separately recognise the rights and obligations retained, or created, in the transfer as assets and liabilities as appropriate.\nFrom 1 October 2018, assets disclosed as net loans and advances are subject to the general classification and measurement policy for Financial Assets outlined at the commencement of the Company’s Financial Asset disclosures on page 20. Additionally, expected credit losses associated with loans and advances at amortised cost are recognized and measured in accordance with the accounting policy outlined in Note 12.\n2018 $m\n6,047\n8,379\n6,861\n273,908\n180,965\n1,494\n477,654\n(165)\n710\n478,199\n(2,348)\n475,851\n76,744\n399,107\n475,851\n475,850\n1\n475,851\n30\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n12.

ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nPolicy applicable from 1 October 2018\nEXPECTED CREDIT LOSS IMPAIRMENT MODEL\nThe measurement of expected credit losses reflects an unbiased, probability weighted prediction which evaluates a range of scenarios and takes into account the time value of money, past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.\nExpected credit losses are either measured over 12 months or the expected lifetime of the financial asset, depending on credit deterioration since origination, according to the following three-stage approach:\nStage 1: At the origination of a financial asset, and where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, an allowance equivalent to 12 months ECL is recognised reflecting the expected credit losses resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months from the reporting date. For instruments with a remaining maturity of less than 12 months, expected credit losses are estimated based on default events that are possible over the remaining time to maturity.\nStage 2: Where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised reflecting expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. If credit risk were to improve in a subsequent period such that the increase in credit risk since origination is no longer considered significant, the exposure returns to a Stage 1 classification and a 12 month ECL applies.\nStage 3: Where there is objective evidence of impairment, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised.\nExpected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for exposures in Stage 1 and Stage 2, and on either a collective or individual basis when transferred to Stage 3.\nMEASUREMENT OF EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS\nECL is calculated as the product of the following credit risk factors at a facility level, discounted to incorporate the time value of money:\nProbability of default (PD) - the estimate of the likelihood that a borrower will default over a given period;\nExposure at default (EAD) - the expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and interest, expected additional drawdowns and accrued interest; and\nLoss given default (LGD) - the expected loss in the event of the borrower defaulting, expressed as a percentage of the facility's EAD, taking into account direct and indirect recovery costs.\nThese credit risk factors are adjusted for current and forward looking information through the use of macro-economic variables.\nEXPECTED LIFE\nWhen estimating ECL for exposures in Stage 2 and 3, the Company considers the expected lifetime over which it is exposed to credit risk.\nFor non-retail portfolios, the Company uses the maximum contractual period as the expected lifetime for non-revolving credit facilities. For non-retail revolving credit facilities, such as corporate lines of credit, the expected life reflects the Company’s contractual right to withdraw a facility as part of a contractually agreed annual review, after taking into account the applicable notice period.\nFor retail portfolios, the expected lifetime is determined using behavioural term, taking into account expected prepayment behaviour and substantial modifications.\nDEFINITION OF DEFAULT, CREDIT IMPAIRED AND WRITE-OFFS\nThe definition of default used in measuring expected credit losses is aligned to the definition used for internal credit risk management purposes across all portfolios. This definition is also in line with the regulatory definition of default. Default occurs when there are indicators that a debtor is unlikely to fully satisfy contractual credit obligations to the Company, or the exposure is 90 days past due.\nFinancial assets, including those that are well secured, are considered credit impaired for financial reporting purposes when they default.\nWhen there is no realistic probability of recovery, loans are written off against the related impairment allowance on completion of the Company’s internal processes and when all reasonably expected recoveries have been collected. In subsequent periods, any recoveries of amounts previously written-off are credited to credit impairment charge in the income statement.\n34\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n12. ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nMODIFIED FINANCIAL ASSETS\nIf the terms of a financial asset are modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one for either credit or commercial reasons, an assessment is made to determine if the changes to the terms of the existing financial asset are considered substantial. This assessment considers both changes in cash flows arising from the modified terms as well as changes in the overall instrument risk profile; for example, changes in the principal (credit limit), term, or type of underlying collateral. Where a modification is considered non-substantial, the existing financial asset is not derecognised and its date of origination continues to be used to determine SICR. Where a modification is considered substantial, the existing financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at its fair value on the modification date, which also becomes the date of origination used to determine SICR for this new asset.\nSIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CREDIT RISK (SICR)\nStage 2 assets are those that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination. In determining what constitutes a SICR, the Company considers both qualitative and quantitative information:\ni.\nInternal credit rating grade\nFor the majority of portfolios, the primary indicator of a SICR is a significant deterioration in the internal credit rating grade of a facility since origination and is measured by application of thresholds.\nFor non-retail portfolios, a SICR is determined by comparing the Customer Credit Rating (CCR) applicable to a facility at reporting date to the CCR at origination of that facility. A CCR is assigned to each borrower which reflects the probability of default of the borrower and incorporates both borrower and non-borrower specific information, including forward looking information. CCRs are subject to review at least annually or more frequently when an event occurs which could affect the credit risk of the customer.\nFor retail portfolios, a SICR is determined by comparing each facility’s scenario weighted lifetime probability of default at the reporting date to the scenario weighted lifetime probability of default at origination. The scenario weighted lifetime probability of default may increase significantly if:\nthere has been a deterioration in the economic outlook, or an increase in economic uncertainty; or\nthere has been a deterioration in the customer’s overall credit position, or ability to manage their credit obligations.\nii. Backstop criteria\nThe Company uses 30 days past due arrears as a backstop criteria for both non-retail and retail portfolios. For retail portfolios only, facilities are required to demonstrate three to six months of good payment behaviour prior to being allocated back to Stage 1.\nFORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION\nForward-looking information is incorporated into both our assessment of whether a financial asset has experienced a significant increase in credit risk since its initial recognition and in our estimate of ECL. In applying forward looking information for estimating ECL, the Company considers four probability-weighted forecast economic scenarios as follows:\ni. Base case scenario\nThe base case scenario is ANZ’s view of the most likely future macro-economic conditions. It reflects management’s assumptions used for strategic planning and budgeting, and also informs ANZ’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) which is the process ANZ applies in strategic and capital planning over a 3 year time horizon;\nii. Upside and iii. Downside scenarios\nThe upside and downside scenarios are fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions (that is, they are not based on the economic conditions prevailing at balance date) and are based on a combination of more optimistic (in the case of the upside) and pessimistic (in the case of the downside) economic events and uncertainty over long term horizons; and\niv. Severe downside scenario\nThe severe downside scenario is fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions and accounts for the potentially severe impact of less likely extremely adverse economic conditions. It reflects macro-economic conditions of a downturn economic event with a probability of occurrence once every 25 years.\nThe four scenarios are described in terms of macro-economic variables used in the PD, LGD and EAD models (collectively the ECL models) depending on the portfolio and country of the borrower. Examples of the variables include unemployment rates, GDP growth rates, house price indices, commercial property price indices and consumer price indices.\n35\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n12. ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nProbability weighting of each scenario is determined by management considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the base case scenario, as well as specific portfolio considerations where required.\nThe Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO) is responsible for reviewing and approving the base case forecast scenario and the Credit and Market Risk Committee (CMRC) approves the probability weights applied to each scenario.\nWhere applicable, temporary adjustments may be made to account for situations where known or expected risks have not been adequately addressed in the modelling process. CMRC is responsible for approving such adjustments. ECL Sensitivity\nThe table below illustrates the impact on the Company’s ECL allowance under scenarios where a 100% weighting is applied to both upside and downside scenarios with all other modelling assumptions remaining constant.\nTotal ECL $m\nImpact $m\n100% upside scenario\n1,956\n(878)\n100% downside scenario\n4,501\n1,668\nPolicy applicable prior to 1 October 2018\nThe Company recognises two types of impairment provisions for its loans and advances:\nIndividual provisions for significant assets that are assessed to be impaired; and\nCollective provisions for portfolios of similar assets that are assessed collectively for impairment.\nThe accounting treatment for each of them is detailed below:\nIndividually\nCollectively\nAssessment\nIf any impaired loans and advances exceed specified thresholds and an impairment event has been identified, then we assess the need for a provision individually.\nTo allow for any small value loans and advances where losses may have been incurred but not yet identified, and individually significant loans and advances that we do not assess as impaired, we assess them collectively in pools of assets with similar credit risk characteristics.\nImpairment\nLoans and advances are assessed as impaired if we have objective evidence that we may not recover principal or interest payments (that is, a loss event has been incurred).\nWe estimate the provision on the basis of historical loss experience for assets with similar credit risk characteristics to others in the respective collective pool. We adjust the historical loss experience based on current observable data – such as: changing economic conditions, the impact of the inherent risk of large concentrated losses within the portfolio and an assessment of the economic cycle.\nMeasurement\nWe measure impairment loss as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and estimated future cash flows discounted to their present value at the asset’s original effective interest rate. We record the result as an expense in profit or loss in the period we identify the impairment and recognise a corresponding reduction in the carrying amount of loans and advances through an offsetting provision.\nUncollectable amounts\nIf a loan or advance is uncollectable (whether partially or in full), then we write off the balance (and also any related provision for credit impairment). We write off unsecured retail facilities at the earlier of the facility becoming 180 days past due, or the customer’s bankruptcy or similar legal release from the obligation to repay the loan or advance. For secured facilities, write offs occur net of the proceeds determined to be recoverable from the realisation of collateral.\nRecoveries\nIf we recover any cash flows from loans and advances we have previously written off, then we recognise the recovery in profit or loss in the period the cash flows are received.\nOff-balance sheet amounts\nAny off-balance sheet items, such as loan commitments, are considered for impairment both on an individual and collective basis.\n36\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n12. ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nApplicable from 1 October 2018\nWhen estimating the allowance for expected credit losses for loans and advances, we used management’s judgement in respect of the\nmatters outlined below.\nKey Judgements\nDetermining when a significant increase in credit risk has occurred\nIn the measurement of ECL, judgement is involved in setting the rules to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition of a loan, resulting in the financial asset moving from ‘stage 1’ to ‘stage 2’. This is a key area of judgement as transition from stage 1 to stage 2 increases the ECL calculation from an allowance based on the probability of default in the next 12 months, to an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses. Subsequent decreases in credit risk combined with transition from stage 2 to stage 1 may similarly result in significant changes in the ECL allowance.\nThe setting of precise trigger points requires judgement which may have a material impact upon the size of the ECL allowance. The Company monitors the effectiveness of SICR criteria on an ongoing basis.\nMeasuring both 12-month and lifetime credit losses\nThe PD, LGD, and EAD credit risk parameters used in determining ECL are point-in-time measures reflecting the relevant forward looking information determined by management. Judgement is involved in determining which forward-looking information variables are relevant for particular lending portfolios and for determining each portfolio’s point-in-time sensitivity.\nIn addition, judgement is required where behavioural characteristics are applied in estimating the lifetime of a facility to be used in measuring ECL. All other things being equal, an increase in the expected behavioural life will increase the amount of ECL.\nForecasting forward-looking scenarios\nOur forecast of forward looking information variables is established from a “base case” or most likely scenario that is used internally by management for planning and forecasting purposes.\nThe expected outcomes of key economic drivers for the base case scenario as at 30 September, 2019 are as follows:\nAustralia The unemployment rate is expected to remain essentially flat and GDP growth to improve modestly over the forecast period, with residential property values expected to improve after a period of decline. Commercial property prices are expected to decline slightly through the forecast period. Consumer price index growth is expected to rise from current levels.\nRest of world GDP growth is forecast to taper lower in the near term due to uncertainty in the global outlook. Inflation is also expected to remain soft over the forecast period to 2020.\nProbability weighting of each scenario\nProbability weighting of each scenario is determined by management considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the base case scenario, as well as specific portfolio considerations where required.\nManagement temporary adjustments\nManagement temporary adjustments to the ECL allowance are adjustments we use in circumstances where we judge that our existing inputs, assumptions and model techniques do not capture all the risk factors relevant to our lending portfolios. Emerging local or global macroeconomic, microeconomic or political events, and natural disasters that are not incorporated into our current parameters, risk ratings, or forward-looking information are examples of such circumstances.\nThe use of management temporary adjustments may impact the amount of ECL recognised.\n37\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n12. ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nApplicable prior to 1 October 2018\nWhen we measured impairment of loans and advances, we used management’s judgement of the extent of losses at reporting date.\nIndividually\nCollectively\nKey Judgements\nEstimated future cash flows\nEstimated future cash flows\nBusiness prospects for the customer\nHistorical loss experience of assets with\nRealisable value of any collateral\nsimilar risk characteristics\nGroup’s position relative to other claimants\nImpact of large concentrated losses inherent in the portfolio\nReliability of customer information\nAssessment of the economic cycle\nLikely cost and duration of recovering loans We regularly reviewed our key judgements and updated them to reflect actual loss experience.\nFINANCIAL LIABILITIES\nOutlined below is a description of how we classify and measure financial liabilities relevant to the subsequent note disclosures.\nCLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT\nFinancial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, or fair value through profit or loss when they are held for trading. Additionally, financial liabilities can be designated at FVTPL where:\nthe designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch which would otherwise arise;\na group of financial liabilities are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management strategy; or\nthe financial liability contains one or more embedded derivatives unless:\na) the embedded derivative does not significantly modify the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract, or\nb) the embedded derivative is closely related to the host financial liability.\nWhere financial liabilities are designated as measured at fair value, gains or losses relating to changes in the entity’s own credit risk are included in other comprehensive income, except where doing so would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. This section of AASB 9 was early adopted by the Company on 1 October 2013.\n38\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n13.

Any remaining amount of fair value gain or loss we recognise directly in profit or loss. Once we have recognised an amount in other comprehensive income, we do not later reclassify it to profit or loss.\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements represent a liability to repurchase the financial assets that remain on our balance sheet since the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the Company. Over the life of the repurchase agreement, we recognise the difference between the sale price and the repurchase price and charge it to interest expense in the Income Statement.\n39\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n14.

It should be read in conjunction with the Our Approach to Risk Management section of the Directors’ Report in the ANZ 2019 Group Annual Report available at https//shareholder.anz.com/annual-report-shareholder-review.\nThe Board is responsible for establishing and overseeing the Company’s Risk Management Framework (RMF). The Board has delegated authority to the Board Risk Committee (BRC) to develop and monitor compliance with the Company’s risk management policies. The BRC reports regularly to the Board on its activities.\nThe Board approves the strategic objectives of the Company including:\nthe Risk Appetite Statement (RAS), sets out the Board’s expectations regarding the degree of risk that the Company is prepared to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives and business plan; and\nthe Risk Management Strategy (RMS), which describes the Company’s strategy for managing risks and the key elements of the RMF that gives effect to this strategy. This includes a description of each material risk, and an overview of how the RMF addresses each risk, with reference to the relevant policies, standards and procedures. It also includes information on how the Company identifies measures, evaluates, monitors, reports and controls or mitigates material risks.\nThe Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and robust control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. At the Company, risk is everyone’s responsibility.\nThe Company has an independent risk management function, headed by the Chief Risk Officer who:\nis responsible for overseeing the risk profile and the risk management framework;\ncan effectively challenge activities and decisions that materially affect the Company’s risk profile; and\nhas an independent reporting line to the BRC to enable the appropriate escalation of issues of concern.\nThe Company’s Internal Audit Function reports directly to the Board Audit Committee (BAC). Internal Audit provides:\nan independent evaluation of the Company’s RMF annually that seeks to ensure compliance with, and the effectiveness of, the risk management framework;\nfacilitation of a comprehensive review every three years that seeks to ensure that the appropriateness, effectiveness and adequacy of the risk management framework; and\nrecommendations to improve the framework and/or work practices to strengthen the effectiveness of day to day operations.\nCREDIT RISK\nCREDIT RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES Granting credit facilities to customers is one of the Company’s major sources of income. As this activity is also a principal risk, the Company dedicates considerable resources to its management. The Company assumes credit risk in a wide range of lending and other activities in diverse markets and in many jurisdictions. Credit risks arise from traditional lending to customers as well as from inter-bank, treasury, trade finance and capital markets activities around the world.\nOur credit risk management framework ensures we apply a consistent approach across the Company when we measure, monitor and manage the credit risk appetite set by the Board. The Board is assisted and advised by the BRC in discharging its duty to oversee credit risk. The BRC:\nsets the credit risk appetite and credit strategies; and\napproves credit transactions beyond the discretion of executive management.\n42\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n15. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\nCREDIT RISK (continued)\nWe quantify credit risk through an internal credit rating system (masterscales) to ensure consistency across exposure types and to provide a consistent framework for reporting and analysis. The system uses models and other tools to measure the following for customer exposures:\nProbability of Default (PD)\nExpressed by a Customer Credit Rating (CCR), reflecting the Company’s assessment of a customer’s ability to service and repay debt.\nExposure at Default (EAD)\nThe expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and interest, expected additional drawdowns and accrued interest at the time of default.\nLoss Given Default (LGD)\nExpressed by a Security Indicator (SI) ranging from A to G. The SI is calculated by reference to the percentage of loan covered by security which the Company can realise if a customer defaults. The A-G scale is supplemented by a range of other SIs which cover factors such as cash cover and sovereign backing. For retail and some small business customers, we group exposures into large homogenous pools – and the LGD is assigned at the pool level.\nOur specialist credit risk teams develop and validate the Company’s PD and LGD rating models. The outputs from these models drive our day-to-day credit risk management decisions including origination, pricing, approval levels, regulatory capital adequacy, economic capital allocation, and credit provisioning.\nAll customers with whom the Company has a credit relationship are assigned a CCR at origination via either of the following assessment approaches:\nLarge and more complex lending\nRetail and some small business lending\nRating models provide a consistent and structured assessment, with judgement required around the use of out-of-model factors. We handle credit approval on a dual approval basis, jointly with the business writer and an independent credit officer.\nAutomated assessment of credit applications using a combination of scoring (application and behavioural), policy rules and external credit reporting information. If the application does not meet the automated assessment criteria, then it is referred out for manual assessment.\nWe use the Company’s internal CCRs to manage the credit quality of financial assets neither past due nor impaired. To enable wider comparisons, the Company’s CCRs are mapped to external rating agency scales as follows:\nCredit Quality Description\nInternal CCR\nANZ Customer Requirements\nMoody’s Rating\nStandard & Poor’s\nRating\nStrong\nCCR 0+ to 4-\nDemonstrated superior stability in their operating and financial performance over the long-term, and whose earnings capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.\nAaa – Baa3\nAAA – BBB-\nSatisfactory\nCCR 5+ to 6-\nDemonstrated sound operational and financial stability over the medium to long-term — even though some may be susceptible to cyclical trends or variability in earnings.\nBa1 – B1\nBB+ – B+\nWeak\nCCR 7 to 8=\nDemonstrated some operational and financial instability, with variability and uncertainty in profitability and liquidity projected to continue over the short and possibly medium term.\nB2 - Caa\nB - CCC\nDefaulted\nCCR 8- to 10\nWhen doubt arises as to the collectability of a credit facility, the financial instrument (or “the facility”) is classified as defaulted.\nN/A\nN/A\nThe Company has adopted AASB 9 effective from 1 October 2018 which has resulted in changes to the classification and measurement of financial assets, including the impairment of financial assets. The presentation of credit risk information for 2019 has been amended with no restatement of comparatives. Refer Notes 1 and 31 for further details on key requirements and impacts of the changes due to the adoption of AASB 9.\nMAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK For financial assets recognised on the balance sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount. In certain circumstances there may be differences between the carrying amounts reported on the balance sheet and the amounts reported in the tables below. Principally, these differences arise in respect of financial assets that are subject to risks other than credit risk, such as equity instruments which are primarily subject to market risk, or bank notes and coins.\nFor undrawn facilities, this maximum exposure to credit risk is the full amount of the committed facilities. For contingent exposures, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount the Company would have to pay if the instrument is called upon.\nThe table below shows our maximum exposure to credit risk of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions before taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements:\n43\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n15.

Restructured items are facilities in which the original contractual terms have been modified for reasons related to the financial difficulties of the customer. Restructuring may consist of reduction of interest, principal or other payments legally due, or an extension in maturity materially beyond those typically offered for new facilities with similar risk.\nIn 2019, the Company implemented a more market responsive collateral valuation methodology for the home loan portfolio in Australia which increased the number of home loans being classified as impaired rather than past due. Comparative information has not been restated for the change in methodology. Additionally, refinement to underlying processes and associated data resulted in the transfer of loans from past due and sub- standard categories into impaired assets. Comparative information has been restated with a transfer from past due of $99 million and from sub- standard of $27 million.\n47\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n15. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\nCREDIT RISK (continued)\nCONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Credit risk becomes concentrated when a number of customers are engaged in similar activities, have similar economic characteristics, or have similar activities within the same geographic region – therefore, they may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. The Company monitors its credit portfolio to manage risk concentration and rebalance the portfolio. The Company also applies single customer counterparty limits to protect against unacceptably large exposures to one single customer.\nComposition of financial instruments that give rise to credit risk by industry group are presented below:\nLoans and advances\nOther financial assets\nOff-balance sheet credit related commitments\nTotal\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\n2019 $m\nAgriculture, forestry, fishing and mining\n20,163\n19,658\n860\n538\n16,117\n15,317\n37,140\nBusiness services\n7,063\n7,158\n112\n82\n6,075\n5,989\n13,250\nConstruction\n4,859\n5,101\n33\n32\n5,140\n5,379\n10,032\nElectricity, gas and water supply\n5,293\n4,916\n1,543\n534\n5,226\n4,508\n12,062\nEntertainment, leisure and tourism\n11,170\n10,652\n652\n305\n2,877\n3,118\n14,699\nFinancial, investment and insurance\n52,333\n43,245\n321,569\n262,203\n39,107\n35,326\n413,009\nGovernment and official institutions\n2,002\n748\n62,886\n63,225\n1,637\n2,043\n66,525\nManufacturing\n19,338\n16,926\n2,196\n1,815\n36,319\n33,298\n57,853\nPersonal lending\n274,357\n288,127\n1,072\n1,070\n42,246\n42,982\n317,675\nProperty services\n34,196\n33,576\n1,009\n484\n15,126\n13,584\n50,331\nRetail trade\n10,771\n10,959\n131\n105\n5,737\n5,458\n16,639\nTransport and storage\n11,955\n10,204\n966\n459\n6,844\n6,606\n19,765\nWholesale trade\n12,665\n11,946\n2,784\n2,644\n16,347\n17,725\n31,796\nOther\n20,970\n14,438\n2,946\n1,739\n13,555\n12,150\n37,471\nGross total\n487,135\n477,654\n398,759\n335,235\n212,353\n203,483 1,098,247\nProvision for credit impairment\n(2,921)\n(2,348)\n(1)\n\n(557)\n(432)\n(3,479)\nSubtotal\n484,214\n475,306\n398,758\n335,235\n211,796\n203,051 1,094,768\nUnearned income\n(144)\n(165)\n\n\n\n\n(144)\nCapitalised brokerage/mortgage origination fees\n585\n710\n\n\n\n\n585\nMaximum exposure to credit risk\n484,655\n475,851\n398,758\n335,235\n211,796\n203,051 1,095,209\n2018 $m\n35,513\n13,229\n10,512\n9,958\n14,075\n340,774\n66,016\n52,039\n332,179\n47,644\n16,522\n17,269\n32,315\n28,327\n1,016,372\n(2,780)\n1,013,592\n(165)\n710\n1,014,137\n48\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n15. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\nCREDIT RISK (continued)\nCOLLATERAL MANAGEMENT We use collateral for on and off-balance sheet exposures to mitigate credit risk if a counterparty cannot meet its repayment obligations from its expected cash flows. Where there is sufficient collateral, an expected credit loss is not recognised. This is largely the case for certain lending products that are secured by corresponding investment for which the margin loans are utilised and for reverse repurchase agreements. For some products, the collateral provided by customers is fundamental to the product’s structuring, so it is not strictly the secondary source of repayment - for example, lending secured by trade receivables is typically repaid by the collection of those receivables. During the period there was no change in our collateral policies.\nThe nature of collateral or security held for the relevant classes of financial assets is as follows:\nNet loans and advances\nLoans - housing and personal\nHousing loans are secured by mortgage(s) over property and additional security may take the form of guarantees and deposits.\nPersonal lending (including credit cards and overdrafts) is predominantly unsecured. If we take security, then it is restricted to eligible vehicles, motor homes and other assets.\nLoans - business\nBusiness loans may be secured, partially secured or unsecured. Typically, we take security by way of a mortgage over property and/or a charge over the business or other assets.\nIf appropriate, we may take other security to mitigate the credit risk, for example: guarantees, standby letters of credit or derivative protection.\nOther financial assets\nTrading securities, Investment securities (from 1 October 2018), Available- for-sale assets (prior to 1 October 2018), Derivatives and Other financial assets\nFor trading securities, we do not seek collateral directly from the issuer or counterparty. However, the collateral may be implicit in the terms of the instrument (for example, with an asset-backed security). The terms of debt securities may include collateralisation.\nFor derivatives, we typically terminate all contracts with the counterparty and settle on a net basis at market levels current at the time of a counterparty default under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreements.\nOur preferred practice is to use a Credit Support Annex (CSA) to the ISDA so that open derivative positions with the counterparty are aggregated and cash collateral (or other forms of eligible collateral) is exchanged daily. The collateral is provided by the counterparty when their position is out of the money (or provided to the counterparty by the Company when our position is out of the money).\nOff-balance sheet positions\nUndrawn and contingent facilities.\nCollateral for off balance sheet positions is mainly held against undrawn facilities, and they are typically performance bonds or guarantees. Undrawn facilities that are secured include housing loans secured by mortgages over residential property and business lending secured by commercial real estate and/or charges over business assets.\nThe table below shows the estimated value of collateral we hold and the net unsecured portion of credit exposures:\nCredit exposure\nTotal value of collateral\nUnsecured portion of credit exposure\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\nNet loans and advances\n484,655\n475,851\n374,041\n372,996\n110,614\n102,855\nOther financial assets\n398,758\n335,235\n29,998\n30,166\n368,760\n305,069\nOff-balance sheet positions\n211,796\n203,051\n33,984\n34,072\n177,812\n168,979\nTotal\n1,095,209\n1,014,137\n438,023\n437,234\n657,186\n576,903\n49\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n15. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\nMARKET RISK\nMARKET RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES Market risk stems from the Company’s trading and balance sheet management activities, the impact of changes and correlation between interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads and volatility in bond, commodity or equity prices.\nThe BRC delegates responsibility for day-to-day management of both market risks and compliance with market risk policies to the Credit & Market Risk Committee (CMRC) and the Group Asset & Liability Committee (GALCO).\nWithin overall strategies and policies established by the BRC, business units and risk management have joint responsibility for the control of market risk at the Company level. The Market Risk team (a specialist risk management unit independent of the business) allocates market risk limits at various levels and monitors and reports on them daily. This detailed framework allocates individual limits to manage and control exposures using risk factors and profit and loss limits.\nManagement, measurement and reporting of market risk is undertaken in two broad categories:\nTraded Market Risk\nNon-Traded Market Risk\nRisk of loss from changes in the value of financial instruments due to movements in price factors for both physical and derivative trading positions. Principal risk categories monitored are:\n1. Currency risk – potential loss arising from changes in foreign exchange rates or their implied volatilities.\n2. Interest rate risk – potential loss from changes in market interest rates or their implied volatilities.\nRisk of loss associated with the management of non-traded interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange exposures. This includes interest rate risk in the banking book. This risk of loss arises from adverse changes in the overall and relative level of interest rates for different tenors, differences in the actual versus expected net interest margin, and the potential valuation risk associated with embedded options in financial instruments and bank products.\n3. Credit spread risk – potential loss arising from a movement in margin or spread relative to a benchmark.\n4. Commodity risk – potential loss arising from changes in commodity prices or their implied volatilities.\n5. Equity risk – potential loss arising from changes in equity prices.\nMEASUREMENT OF MARKET RISK We primarily manage and control market risk using Value at Risk (VaR), sensitivity analysis and stress testing.\nVaR gauges the Company’s possible daily loss based on historical market movements.\nThe Company’s VaR approach for both traded and non-traded risk is historical simulation. We use historical changes in market rates, prices and volatilities over:\nthe previous 500 business days, to calculate standard VaR; and\na 1-year stressed period, to calculate stressed VaR.\nWe calculate traded and non-traded VaR using one-day and ten-day holding periods. For stressed VaR, we use a ten-day period. Back testing is used to ensure our VaR models remain accurate.\nThe Company measures VaR at a 99% confidence interval which means there is a 99% chance that a loss will not exceed the VaR for the relevant holding period.\n50\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n15. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\nMARKET RISK (continued)\nTRADED AND NON-TRADED MARKET RISK\nTraded market risk The table below shows the traded market risk VaR on a diversified basis by risk categories:\n30 September 2019\n30 September 2018\nAs at $m\nHigh for year $m\nLow for year $m\nAverage for year $m\nAs at $m\nHigh for year $m\nLow for year $m\nAverage for year $m\nTraded value at risk 99% confidence\nForeign exchange\n1.3\n9.0\n1.2\n3.6\n2.9\n9.8\n1.7\n4.0\nInterest rate\n2.8\n9.5\n2.8\n5.3\n8.2\n14.9\n4.8\n7.4\nCredit\n4.8\n4.8\n1.1\n2.8\n2.0\n6.2\n2.0\n3.7\nCommodity\n1.5\n4.0\n1.1\n1.8\n3.5\n4.4\n1.1\n2.9\nEquity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversification benefit1\n(4.9)\nn/a\nn/a\n(5.9)\n(9.1)\nn/a\nn/a\n(7.8)\nTotal VaR\n5.5\n13.1\n5.3\n7.6\n7.5\n16.9\n5.8\n10.2\n1. The diversification benefit reflects risks that offset across categories. The high and low VaR figures reported for each factor did not necessarily occur on the same day as the high and low VaR reported for the Company as a whole. Consequently, a diversification benefit for high and low would not be meaningful and is therefore omitted from the table.\nNon-traded market risk\nBalance sheet risk management The principal objectives of balance sheet risk management are to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk to mitigate the negative impact of movements in interest rates on the earnings and market value of the Company’s banking book, while ensuring the Company maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations as they fall due.\nInterest rate risk management Non-traded interest rate risk relates to the potential adverse impact of changes in market interest rates on the Company’s future net interest income. This risk arises from two principal sources, namely mismatches between the repricing dates of interest bearing assets and liabilities; and the investment of capital and other non-interest bearing liabilities in interest bearing assets. Interest rate risk is reported using VaR and scenario analysis (based on the impact of a 1% rate shock). The table below shows VaR figures for non-traded interest rate risk for the combined Company as well as Australia, New Zealand and Asia Pacific, Europe and Americas (APEA) geographies which are calculated separately.\n30 September 2019\n30 September 2018\nAs at $m\nHigh for year $m\nLow for year $m\nAverage for year $m\nAs at $m\nHigh for year $m\nLow for year $m\nAverage for year $m\nNon-traded value at risk 99% confidence\nAustralia\n22.7\n22.7\n16.4\n18.9\n21.9\n32.7\n20.3\n23.6\nNew Zealand\n0.0\n0.1\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.2\n0.0\n0.0\nAsia Pacific, Europe & America\n17.6\n17.6\n12.7\n16.1\n15.5\n15.5\n12.5\n14.0\nDiversification benefit1\n(10.7)\nn/a\nn/a\n(11.0)\n(11.8)\nn/a\nn/a\n(9.6)\nTotal VaR\n29.6\n29.6\n21.2\n24.0\n25.6\n35.2\n22.3\n28.0\n1. The diversification benefit reflects the historical correlation between the regions. The high and low VaR figures reported for the region did not necessarily occur on the same day as the high and low VaR reported for the Company as a whole. Consequently, a diversification benefit for high and low would not be meaningful and is therefore omitted from the table.\n51\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n15. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\nMARKET RISK (continued)\nWe undertake scenario analysis to stress test the impact of extreme events on the Company’s market risk exposures. We model a 1% overnight parallel positive shift in the yield curve to determine the potential impact on our net interest income over the next 12 months. This is a standard risk measure which assumes the parallel shift is reflected in all wholesale and customer rates.\nThe table below shows the outcome of this risk measure for the current and previous financial years, expressed as a percentage of reported net interest income. A positive number signifies that a rate increase is positive for net interest income over the next 12 months.\n2019\nImpact of 1% rate shock\nAs at period end\n1.01%\nMaximum exposure\n1.01%\nMinimum exposure\n0.02%\nAverage exposure (in absolute terms) 1. Prior period numbers have been restated to reflect IRR model enhancements\n0.42%\nEQUITY SECURITIES DESIGNATED AT FVOCI (FROM 1 OCTOBER 2018) AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE (PRIOR TO 1 OCTOBER 2018) Our investment securities (from 1 October 2018) and available-for-sale assets (prior to 1 October 2018) contain equity investment holdings which predominantly comprise investments we hold for longer-term strategic reasons. The market risk impact on these equity investments is not captured by the Company’s VaR processes for traded and non-traded market risks. Therefore, the Company regularly reviews the valuations of the investments within the portfolio and assesses whether the investments are impaired based on the recognition and measurement policies set out in Note 10 Investment securities.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RISK – STRUCTURAL EXPOSURES Our investment of capital in foreign operations — for example, branches, subsidiaries or associates with functional currencies other than the Australian Dollar — exposes the Company to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates. Variations in the value of these foreign operations arising as a result of exchange differences are reflected in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity.\nWhere it is considered appropriate, the Company takes out economic hedges against larger foreign exchange denominated revenue streams (primarily New Zealand Dollar, US dollar and US dollar correlated). The primary objective of hedging is to ensure that, if practical, the consolidated capital ratios are neutral to the effect of changes in exchange rates.\nLIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISK\nLIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING POSITION For information related to the liquidity risk and funding position refer to the ANZ 2019 Group Annual Report (Note 16 Financial Risk Management), available at https://shareholder.anz.com/annual-report-shareholder-review.\nRESIDUAL CONTRACTUAL MATURITY ANALYSIS OF THE COMPANY’S LIABILITIES The table below provides residual contractual maturity analysis of financial liabilities at 30 September within relevant maturity groupings. The table below excludes “Due to controlled entities” liabilities of $89.7 billion (2018: $88.4 billion) as the contractual maturity is linked to the repayment of underlying assets which are managed on a pool basis which is continuously reviewed. All outstanding Debt Issuance and Subordinated Debt is profiled on the earliest date on which the Company may be required to pay. All at-call liabilities are reported in the “Less than 3 months” category. Any other items without a specified maturity date are included in the “After 5 years” category. The amounts represent principal and interest cash flows - so they may differ from equivalent amounts reported on balance sheet. It should be noted that this is not how the Company manages its liquidity risk. The management of this risk is detailed in the ANZ 2019 Group Annual Report (Note 16 Financial Risk Management), available at https://shareholder.anz.com/annual-report-shareholder-review.\n20181\n0.98%\n1.77%\n0.23%\n0.77%\n52\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n15.

The full mark-to-market of derivative liabilities not held for balance sheet management purposes is included in the “less than 3 months” category.\nAt 30 September 2019 $171,881 million (2018: $164,944 million) of the Company’s undrawn facilities and $40,472 million (2018: $38,539 million) of its issued guarantees mature in less than 1 year, based on the earliest date on which the Company may be required to pay.\n53\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n16. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES\nThe Company carries a significant number of financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. The fair value is the best estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nVALUATION The Company has an established control framework, including appropriate segregation of duties, to ensure that fair values are accurately determined, reported and controlled. The framework includes the following features:\nproducts are approved for transacting with external customers and counterparties only where fair values can be appropriately determined;\nquoted market prices used to value financial instruments are independently verified with information from external pricing providers;\nfair value methodologies and inputs are evaluated and approved by a function independent of the party that undertakes the transaction;\nmovements in fair values are independently monitored and explained by reference to underlying factors relevant to the fair value; and\nvaluation adjustments (such as funding valuation adjustments, credit valuation adjustments and bid-offer adjustments) are independently validated and monitored.\nIf the Company holds offsetting risk positions, then the Company uses the portfolio exemption in AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement (AASB 13) to measure the fair value of such groups of financial assets and financial liabilities. We measure the portfolio based on the price that would be received to sell a net long position (an asset) for a particular risk exposure, or to transfer a net short position (a liability) for a particular risk exposure.\nFair value designation\nWe designate certain loans and advances and certain deposits and other borrowings and debt issuances as fair value through profit or loss:\nwhere they contain a separable embedded derivative which significantly modifies the instruments’ cash flow; or\nin order to eliminate an accounting mismatch which would arise if the asset or liabilities were otherwise carried at amortised cost. This mismatch arises as we measure the derivative financial instruments (which we acquired to mitigate interest rate risk of the assets or liabilities) at fair value through profit or loss.\nOur approach ensures that we recognise the fair value movements on the assets or liabilities in profit or loss in the same period as the movement on the associated derivatives.\nWe may also designate certain loans and advances and certain deposits and other borrowings and debt issuances as fair value through profit or loss where they are managed on a fair value basis to align the measurement with how the instruments are managed.\nFAIR VALUE APPROACH AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES We use valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities for recognition, measurement and disclosure purposes where no quoted price in an active market exists for that asset or liability. This includes the following:\nAsset or Liability\nFair Value Approach\nFinancial instruments classified as:\nTrading securities\nSecurities sold short\nValuation techniques are used that incorporate observable market inputs for financial instruments with similar credit risk, maturity and yield characteristics. Equity instruments that are not traded in active markets may be measured using comparable company valuation multiples.\nDerivative financial assets and liabilities\nInvestment securities (from 1 October 2018)\nAvailable-for-sale assets (prior to 1 October 2018)\nFinancial instruments classified as:\nNet loans and advances\nDeposits and other borrowings\nDiscounted cash flow techniques are used whereby contractual future cash flows of the instruments are discounted using wholesale market interest rates, or market borrowing rates for debt with similar maturities or yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity.\nDebt issuances\n54\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n16.

During the year, there were no material transfers from Level 1 to Level 3 (2018: $676 million); Level 2 to Level 1 (2018: $783 million) and Level 1 to Level 2. Transfers into and out of levels are\nmeasured at the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred.\n2. On adoption of AASB 9 on 1 October 2018, the classification and measurement of financial assets was revised. The available-for-sale classification used in comparative periods no longer exists under AASB 9 and a new classification of investment securities was introduced. Comparative information has not been restated.\n3. Payables and other liabilities relates to securities sold short, which we classify as held for trading and measured at fair value through profit or loss.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT INCORPORATING UNOBSERVABLE MARKET DATA\nLevel 3 fair value measurements\nThe net balance of Level 3 is an asset of $1,163 million (2018: $1,088 million). The assets and liabilities which incorporate significant unobservable inputs primarily include:\nequities for which there is no active market or traded prices cannot be observed;\nstructured credit products for which credit spreads and default probabilities relating to the reference assets and derivative counterparties cannot be observed;\nother derivatives referencing market rates that cannot be observed primarily due to lack of market activity.\nMovement in the Level 3 balance is mainly due to the revaluation of the Company’s investment in Bank of Tianjin.\nThere were no other material transfers in or out of Level 3 during the period.\nBank of Tianjin (BoT)\nThe investment is valued based on comparative price-to-book (P/B) multiples (a P/B multiple is the ratio of the market value of equity to the book value of equity). The extent of judgement applied in determining the appropriate multiple and comparator group from which the multiple is derived are non-observable inputs which have resulted in the Level 3 classification.\n2018 $m\n29,519\n64,448\n64,728\n1\n\n158,696\n55\n65,638\n1,060\n1,442\n68,195\n56\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n16. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (continued)\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT INCORPORATING UNOBSERVABLE MARKET DATA (continued)\nSensitivity to Level 3 data inputs\nWhen we make assumptions due to significant inputs not being directly observable in the market place (Level 3 inputs), then changing these assumptions changes the Company’s estimate of the instrument’s fair value. Favourable and unfavourable changes are determined by changing the primary unobservable parameter used to derive the valuation.\nBank of Tianjin (BoT) The valuation of the BoT investment is sensitive to the selected unobservable input, being the P/B multiple. If the P/B multiple was increased or decreased by 10% it would result in a $111 million (Sep 18: $102 million) increase or decrease to the fair value of the investment, which would be recognised in shareholders’ equity.\nOther The remaining Level 3 balance is immaterial and changes in the Level 3 inputs have a minimal impact on net profit and net assets of the Company.\nDeferred fair value gains and losses Where fair values are determined using unobservable inputs, the Company does not immediately recognise the difference between the transaction price and the amount we determine based on the valuation technique (day one gain or loss) in profit or loss. After initial recognition, we recognise the deferred amount in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the life of the transaction or until all inputs become observable.\nThe day one gains and losses deferred are not material.\nFINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE\nThe following table sets out the Company’s basis of estimating fair values of financial instruments carried at amortised cost:\nFinancial Asset and Liability\nFair Value Approach\nInvestment securities – debt securities at amortised cost\nCalculated based on quoted market prices or observable inputs as applicable. If quoted market prices are not available, we use a discounted cash flow model using a yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity of the debt instrument. The fair value reflects adjustments to credit spreads applicable for that instrument.\nNet loans and advances to banks\nDiscounted cash flows using prevailing market rates for loans with similar credit quality.\nNet loans and advances to customers\nPresent value of future cash flows, discounted using a curve that incorporates changes in wholesale market rates, the Company’s cost of wholesale funding and the customer margin, as appropriate.\nDeposit liability without a specified maturity or at call\nThe amount payable on demand at the reporting date. We do not adjust the fair value for any value we expect the Company to derive from retaining the deposit for a future period.\nInterest bearing fixed maturity deposits and other borrowings and acceptances with quoted market rates\nMarket borrowing rates of interest for debt with a similar maturity are used to discount contractual cash flows to derive the fair value.\nDebt issuances\nCalculated based on quoted market prices or observable inputs as applicable. If quoted market prices are not available, we use a discounted cash flow model using a yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity of the debt instrument.

Investment securities under AASB 9 includes securities measured at amortised cost.\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nThe Company evaluates the material accuracy of the valuations incorporated in the financial statements as they can involve a high degree of judgement and estimation in determining the carrying values of financial assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.\nThe majority of valuation models the Company uses employ only observable market data as inputs. However, for certain financial instruments, we may use data that is not readily observable in current markets. If we use unobservable market data, then we need to exercise more judgement to determine fair value depending on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation. Generally, we derive unobservable inputs from other relevant market data and compare them to observed transaction prices where available.\nWhen establishing the fair value of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, the Company considers valuation adjustments in determining the fair value. We may apply adjustments (such as bid/offer spreads, credit valuation adjustments and funding valuation adjustments – refer Note 9 Derivative Financial Instruments) to the techniques used to reflect the Company’s assessment of factors that market participants would consider in setting fair value.\n58\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n17.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nManagement judgement is used to assess the recoverable value of goodwill, and other intangible assets, and the useful economic life of an asset (or if an asset has an indefinite life). We reassess the recoverability of the carrying value at each reporting date.\nAt each balance date, software and other intangible assets, including those not ready for use, are assessed for indicators of impairment. In the event that an asset’s carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount, the carrying value of the asset is written down immediately.\nIn addition, the expected useful economic life of intangible assets, including software assets, are assessed at each reporting date. The assessment requires management judgement, and in relation to our software assets, a number of factors can influence the expected useful lives. These factors include changes to business strategy, significant divestments and the pace of technological change.\n62\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n20.

Costs relating to on-going activities are not provided for and are expensed as incurred.\nNon-lending losses, frauds and forgeries\nNon-lending losses include losses arising from certain legal actions not directly related to amounts of principal outstanding for loans and advances and losses arising from forgeries, frauds and the correction of operational issues. The amounts recognised are the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties that surround the events and circumstances that affect the provision.\nOther\nOther provisions comprise various other provisions including workers compensation, make-good provisions associated with leased premises and contingent liabilities recognised as part of a business combination.\n63\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n20. OTHER PROVISIONS (continued)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nThe Company recognises provisions when there is a present obligation arising from a past event, an outflow of economic resources is probable, and the amount of the provision can be measured reliably.\nThe amount recognised is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the estimated cash flows required to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows..\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nThe Company holds provisions for various obligations including customer remediation, restructuring costs and surplus lease space, non-lending losses, fraud and forgeries and litigation related claims. These provisions involve judgements regarding the timing and outcome of future events, including estimates of expenditure required to satisfy such obligations. Where relevant, expert legal advice has been obtained and, in light of such advice, provisions and/or disclosures as deemed appropriate have been made.\nIn relation to customer remediation, determining the amount of the provisions, which represent management’s best estimate of the cost of settling the identified matters, requires the exercise of significant judgement. It will often be necessary to form a view on a number of different assumptions, including, the number of impacted customers, the average refund per customer, the associated remediation project costs, and the implications of regulatory exposures and customer claims having regard to their specific facts and circumstances. Consequently, the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions is reviewed on a regular basis against actual experience and other relevant evidence including expert legal advice and adjustments are made to the provisions where appropriate.\n64\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n21.

On-market purchases for the DRP in the September 2019 financial year were $432 million (Sep 18 full year: $392 million).\n3 The Company completed a $3.0 billion on-market share buy-back of ANZ ordinary shares purchasing $1,120 million in the September 2019 full year (Sep 18 full year: $1,880 million) resulting in 42.0 million\nANZ ordinary shares being cancelled in the September 2019 full year (Sep 18 full year: 66.7 million)\n65\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n21. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY (continued)\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nOrdinary shares\nOrdinary shares have no par value. They entitle holders to receive dividends, or proceeds available on winding up of the Company, in proportion to the number of fully paid ordinary shares held. They are recognised at the amount paid per ordinary share net of directly attributable costs. Every holder of fully paid ordinary shares present at a meeting in person, or by proxy, is entitled to:\non a show of hands, one vote; and  on a poll, one vote, for each share held.\nTreasury shares\nTreasury shares are shares in the Company which:\nthe ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan purchases on market and have not yet distributed, or  the Company issues to the ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan and have not yet been distributed.\nTreasury shares are deducted from share capital and excluded from the weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the earnings per share calculations.\nReserves:\nForeign currency translation reserve\nIncludes differences arising on translation of assets and liabilities into Australian dollars when the functional currency of a foreign operation (including subsidiaries and branches) is not Australian dollars. In this reserve, we reflect any offsetting gains or losses on hedging these exposures, together with any tax effect.\nCash flow hedge reserve\nIncludes fair value gains and losses associated with the effective portion of designated cash flow hedging instruments together with any tax effect.\nAvailable-for-sale reserve (prior to 1 October 2018)\nIncludes the changes in fair value and exchange differences on the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets together with any tax effect.\nFVOCI reserve (from 1 October 2018)\nIncludes changes in the fair value of certain debt securities and equity securities included within Investment Securities together with any tax effect.\nIn respect of debt securities classified as measured at FVOCI, the FVOCI reserve records accumulated changes in fair value arising subsequent to initial recognition, except for those relating to allowance for expected credit losses, interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses which are recognised in profit or loss. As debt securities at FVOCI are recorded at fair value, the balance of the FVOCI reserve is net of the ECL allowance associated with such assets. When a debt security measured at FVOCI is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in the FVOCI reserve in respect of that security is reclassified to profit or loss and presented in Other Operating Income.\nIn respect of the equity securities classified as measured at FVOCI, the FVOCI reserve records accumulated changes in fair value arising subsequent to initial recognition (including any related foreign exchange gains or losses). When an equity security measured at FVOCI is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in the FVOCI reserve in respect of that security is not recycled to profit or loss.\nShare option reserve\nIncludes amounts which arise on the recognition of share-based compensation expense.\n66\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY\nThe Company’s capital management strategy aims to protect the interests of depositors, creditors and shareholders. We achieve this through an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) whereby the Company conducts detailed strategic and capital planning over a 3 year time horizon. The process involves:\nforecasting economic variables, financial performance of the Company’s divisions and the financial impact of new strategic initiatives to be implemented during the planning period;\nperforming stress tests under different economic scenarios to determine the level of additional capital (‘stress capital buffer’) needed to absorb losses that may be experienced under an economic downturn;\nreviewing capital ratios and targets across various classes of capital against the Company’s risk profile; and\ndeveloping a capital plan, taking into account capital ratio targets, current and future capital issuances requirements and options around capital products, timing and markets to execute the capital plan under differing market and economic conditions.\nThe capital plan is approved by the Board and updated as required. The Board and senior management are provided with regular updates of the Company’s capital position. Any material actions required to ensure ongoing prudent capital management are submitted to the Board for approval. Throughout the year, the Company maintained compliance with all the regulatory requirements related to Capital Adequacy in the jurisdictions in which it operates.\nREGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\nAs ANZ is an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) in Australia, it is regulated by APRA under the Banking Act 1959 (Cth). The Company must comply with the minimum regulatory capital requirements, prudential capital ratios and specific reporting levels that APRA sets and which are consistent with the global Basel III capital framework. This is the common framework for determining the appropriate level of bank regulatory capital as set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).\nFor reporting purposes as part of the ANZ 2019 Annual Report, Capital Adequacy Ratios are presented for the Level 2 ADI and are not presented for the Company as a standalone entity. Refer to Note 23 Capital Management in the ANZ 2019 Group Annual Report for details of the Capital Adequacy Ratios, which can be found at https://shareholder.anz.com/annual-report-shareholders-review.\n67\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n23.

The Company assesses whether it has power over those entities by examining the Company’s existing rights to direct the relevant activities of the entity. Investments in controlled entities are carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.\nAt least at each reporting date, the Company reviews investments in controlled entities for any indication of impairment. If an indication of impairment exists, then the Company determines the recoverable amount of the controlled entity using the higher of:\n\nthe controlled entity’s fair value less cost of disposal; and\n\nits value-in-use.\nWe use a discounted cash flow methodology, and other methodologies (such as capitalisation of earnings methodology), to determine the recoverable amount.\n2018 $m\n51\n849\n205\n18\n200\n167\n550\n10\n12,053\n17\n398\n6\n40\n36\n25\n2,563\n\n1,121\n40\n5\n24\n43\n5\n6\n158\n262\n18,852\n68\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n24. TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\nIn the normal course of business the Company enters into transactions where it transfers financial assets directly to third parties or to Structured Entities (SEs). These transfers may give rise to the Company fully, or partially derecognising those financial assets depending on the Company’s exposure to the risks and rewards or control over the transferred assets. If the Company retains substantially all of the risk and rewards of a transferred asset, the transfer does not qualify for derecognition and the asset remains on the Company’s balance sheet in its entirety.\nSECURITISATIONS\nNet loans and advances include residential mortgages securitised under the Company’s securitisation programs which are assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs to provide security for obligations payable on the notes issued by the SEs. The holders of the issued notes have full recourse to the pool of residential mortgages which have been securitised and the Company cannot otherwise pledge or dispose of the transferred assets.\nIn some instances the Company is also the holder of the securitised notes. In addition, the Company is entitled to any residual income of the SEs and sometimes enters into derivatives with the SEs. The Company retains the risks and rewards of the residential mortgages and continues to recognise the mortgages as financial assets. The obligation to pay this amount to the SE is recognised as a financial liability of the Company.\nThe Company is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with these securitisation SEs and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the SEs activities. The SEs are therefore consolidated by the Company when preparing consolidated Group financial statements.\nCOVERED BONDS\nThe Company operates various global covered bond programs to raise funding in its primary markets. Net loans and advances include residential mortgages assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs associated with these covered bond programs. The mortgages provide security for the obligations payable on the issued covered bonds.\nThe covered bond holders have dual recourse to the issuer and the cover pool of assets. The issuer cannot otherwise pledge or dispose of the transferred assets, however, subject to legal arrangements it may repurchase and substitute assets as long as the required cover is maintained.\nThe Company is required to maintain the cover pool at a level sufficient to cover the bond obligations. In addition the Company is entitled to any residual income of the covered bond SEs and enters into derivatives with the SEs. The Company retains the majority of the risks and rewards of the residential mortgages and continues to recognise the mortgages as financial assets. The obligation to pay this amount to the SEs is recognised as a financial liability of the Company.\nThe Company is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with the covered bond SEs and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the SEs activities. The SEs are therefore consolidated by the Company when preparing consolidated Group financial statements. The covered bonds issued externally are included within debt issuances.\nREPURCHASE AGREEMENTS\nWhen the Company sells securities subject to repurchase agreements under which we retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, then those assets do not qualify for derecognition. An associated liability is recognised for the consideration received from the counterparty.\nThe table below sets out the balance of assets transferred that do not qualify for derecognition, along with the associated liabilities:\nSecuritisations1,2\nCovered bonds\nRepurchase agreements\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\nCurrent carrying amount of assets transferred\n65,947\n64,765\n20,052\n19,612\n42,640\n39,332\nCarrying amount of associated liabilities\n65,947\n64,765\n20,052\n19,612\n40,826\n37,581\n1.

The carrying value of securitised assets and the associated liabilities approximates their fair value.\n69\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n25. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE\nAt 30 September 2019 and 30 September 2018, there were no assets or liabilities that have been reclassified to held for sale.\nINCOME STATEMENT IMPACT RELATING TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE\nDuring 2018, the Company recognised the following impacts in relation to assets and liabilities held for sale:\n$13 million gain relating to the completion of the sale related activities of the Asia Retail and Wealth business.\n$247 million net gain relating to SRCB comprising a $289 million gain on release of reserves, $56 million of foreign exchange losses and other costs, and a $14 million adjustment for tax.\nThe net result of these disposals is included in other income (refer to Note 2 Operating Income).\nKEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\nA significant level of judgement is used by the Company to determine:\nwhether an asset or group of assets is classified and presented as held for sale or as a discontinued operation; and\nthe fair value of the assets and liabilities classified as being held for sale.\nManagement is required to exercise significant judgement when assessing the fair value less costs to sell for assets and liabilities held for sale. The judgemental factors include determining: costs to sell, allocation of goodwill, indemnities provided under the sale contract and consideration received - particularly where elements of consideration are contingent in nature. Any impairment we record is based on the best available evidence of fair value compared to the carrying value before the impairment. The final sale price may be different to the fair value we estimate when recording the impairment. Management regularly assess the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions against actual outcomes and other relevant evidence and adjustments are made to fair value where appropriate. We expect that the sales will complete within 12 months after balance date, subject to the relevant regulatory approvals and customary terms of sale for such assets.\n70\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SUPERANNUATION AND POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS\nSet out below is a summary of amounts recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of the defined benefit superannuation schemes:\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\nDefined benefit obligation and scheme assets\nPresent value of funded defined benefit obligation\n(1,353)\n(1,246)\nFair value of scheme assets\n1,591\n1,385\nNet defined benefit asset\n238\n139\nAs represented in the Balance Sheet\nNet liabilities arising from defined benefit obligations included in payables and other liabilities\n(17)\n(15)\nNet assets arising from defined benefit obligations included in other assets\n255\n154\nNet defined benefit asset\n238\n139\nWeighted average duration of the benefit payments reflected in the defined benefit obligation (years)\n14.9\n16.8\nAs at the most recent reporting dates of the schemes, the aggregate surplus of net market value of assets over the value of accrued benefits on a funding basis was $38 million (2018: deficit of $10 million). In 2019, the Company made defined benefit contributions totalling $2 million (2018: $2 million). It expects to make contributions of around $2 million next financial year.\nGOVERNANCE OF THE SCHEMES AND FUNDING OF THE DEFINED BENEFIT SECTIONS\nThe main defined benefit superannuation schemes in which the Company participates operate under trust law and are managed and administered on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the relevant trust deed and rules and all relevant legislation. These schemes have corporate trustees, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. The trustees are the legal owners of the assets, which are held separately from the assets of the Company and are responsible for setting investment policy and agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the triennial actuarial valuation process.\nThe defined benefit section of the ANZ Australian Staff Superannuation Scheme and ANZ UK Staff Pension Scheme are the two largest defined benefit plans and have been closed to new members since 1987 and 2004 respectively. These plans did not have a material deficit, or surplus, at the last funding valuations. The Company has no present liability under the schemes’ trust deeds to fund a deficit (measured on a funding basis). A contingent liability of the Company may arise if any of these schemes were wound up.\nRECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\nDefined benefit superannuation schemes\nFor the Company’s defined benefit schemes, an independent actuary calculates the liability and expenses related to providing benefits to employees under each defined benefit scheme. They use the Projected Unit Credit Method to value the liabilities. The balance sheet includes:\na defined benefit liability if the obligation is greater than the fair value of the schemes assets; and\nan asset (capped to its recoverable amount) if the fair value of the assets is greater than the obligation.\nIn each reporting period, the movements in the net defined benefit liability are recognised as follows:\nthe net movement relating to the current period’s service cost, net interest on the defined benefit liability, past service costs and other costs (such as the effects of any curtailments and settlements) as operating expenses;\nremeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (which comprise actuarial gains and losses and return on scheme assets, excluding interest income included in net interest) directly in retained earnings through other comprehensive income; and\ncontributions of the Company directly against the net defined benefit position.\nDefined contribution superannuation schemes\nThe Company operates a number of defined contribution schemes. It also contributes (according to local law, in the various countries in which it operates) to Government and other plans that have the characteristics of defined contribution plans. The Company’s contributions to these schemes are recognised as personnel expenses when they are incurred.\n71\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n26.

EMPLOYEE SHARE AND OPTION PLANS\nThe Company operates a number of employee share and option schemes under the ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan and the ANZ Share Option Plan.\nANZ EMPLOYEE SHARE ACQUISITION PLAN\nANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan schemes that operated during the 2019 and 2018 years were the Employee Share Offer and the Deferred Share Plan.\nEmployee Share Offer\nEligibility\nMost permanent employees employed in either Australia or New Zealand with three years continuous service for the most recent financial year.\nGrant\nUp to AUD 1,000 in Australia (and AUD 800 in New Zealand) ANZ shares each financial year, subject to Board approval.\nAllocation value\nOne week Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of ANZ shares traded on the ASX in the week leading up to and including the date of grant.\nAustralia\nANZ ordinary shares are granted to eligible employees for nil consideration. The shares vest on grant and are held in trust for three years from grant date, after which time they may remain in trust, be transferred to the employee’s name or sold. Dividends are automatically reinvested in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan.\nNew Zealand\nShares are granted to eligible employees on payment of NZD one cent per share. Shares vest subject to satisfaction of a three year service period, after which they may remain in trust, be transferred to the employee’s name or sold. Unvested shares are forfeited if the employee resigns or is dismissed for serious misconduct. Dividends are either paid in cash or reinvested into the Dividend Reinvestment Plan.\nExpensing value (fair value)\nIn Australia, the fair value of the shares is expensed in the year shares are granted, as they are not subject to forfeiture.\nIn New Zealand, the fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the three year vesting period.\nThe expense is recognised as a share-based compensation expense with a corresponding increase in equity.\n2019 and 2018 grants\n656,738 shares were granted on 3 December 2018 at an issue price of $26.91.\n541,982 shares were granted on 1 December 2017 at an issue price of $28.67.\n72\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n27. EMPLOYEE SHARE AND OPTION PLANS (continued)\nDeferred Share Plan\ni) ANZ Incentive Plan (ANZIP) - Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Group Executive Committee (ExCo)\nEligibility\nGroup CEO and ExCo.\nGrant\n50% of the CEO’s Annual Variable Remuneration (AVR) and 25% of ExCo’s Variable Remuneration (VR) received as deferred shares.\nConditions ii) ANZIP (excluding the CEO and ExCo) and Business Unit Incentive Plans (BUIPs) - for grants from 1 October 2017\nDeferred over four years from grant date.\nEligibility\nAll employees excluding the CEO and ExCo.\nGrant\nConditions\nIf VR is at or exceeds AUD 150,000, then 60% of incentive amounts exceeding AUD 80,000 (subject to a minimum deferral amount of AUD 42,000) is deferred as shares. Deferred over three years from grant date.\niii) Long Term Incentives (LTIs)\nEligibility\nSelected employees.\nGrant\n100% deferred shares.\nConditions\nVest three years from grant date.\niv) Exceptional circumstances\nRemuneration foregone\nIn exceptional circumstances, we grant deferred shares to certain employees when they start with the Company to compensate them for remuneration they have foregone from their previous employer. The vesting period generally aligns with the remaining vesting period of the remuneration they have foregone, and therefore varies between grants.\nRetention\nWe may grant deferred shares to high performing employees who are regarded as a significant retention risk to the Company.\nv) Further information\nCessation\nUnless the Board decides otherwise, employees forfeit their unvested deferred shares if they resign, are terminated on notice, or are dismissed for serious misconduct. The deferred shares may be held in trust beyond the deferral period.\nDividends\nDividends are paid in cash or reinvested in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan.\nInstrument\nDeferred share rights may be granted instead of deferred shares in some countries as locally appropriate (see deferred share rights section).\nAllocation value\nAll deferred shares are issued based on the VWAP of ANZ shares traded on the ASX in the week leading up to and including the date of grant.\nExpensing value (fair value) We expense the fair value of deferred shares on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period and we\n2019 and 2018 grants\nDownward adjustment\nrecognise the expense as a share-based compensation expense with a corresponding increase in equity. During the 2019 year, we granted 1,945,668 deferred shares (2018: 2,232,563) with a weighted average grant price of $25.39 (2018: $29.31). Deferred shares remain at risk and the Board has the discretion to adjust the number of deferred shares downwards, including to zero at any time before the vesting date. ANZ’s downward adjustment provisions are detailed in section 6.3 of the 2019 Remuneration Report. Board discretion was exercised to adjust downward 9,810 deferred shares to zero in 2019 (2018: 2,632).\n73\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n27. EMPLOYEE SHARE AND OPTION PLANS (continued)\nExpensing of the ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan\nExpensing value (fair value)\nThe fair value of shares we granted during 2019 under the Employee Share Offer and the Deferred Share Plan, measured as at the date of grant of the shares, is $67.7 million (2018: $80.9 million) based on 2,602,406 shares (2018: 2,774,545) at VWAP of $26.01 (2018: $29.17).\nANZ SHARE OPTION PLAN\nAllocation\nWe may grant selected employees options/rights which entitle them to acquire fully paid ordinary ANZ shares at a fixed price at the time the options/rights vest. Voting and dividend rights will be attached to the ordinary shares allocated on exercise of the options/rights.\nEach option/right entitles the holder to one ordinary share subject to the terms and conditions imposed on grant. Exercise price of options, determined in accordance with the rules of the plan, is generally based on the VWAP of the shares traded on the ASX in the week leading up to and including the date of grant. For rights, the exercise price is nil.\nRules\nPrior to the exercise of the option/right if the Company changes its share capital due to a bonus share issue, pro-rata new share issue or reorganisation the following adjustments are required:\nIssue of bonus shares - When the holder exercises their option, they are also entitled to be issued the number of bonus shares they would have been entitled to had they held the underlying shares at the time of the bonus issue;\nPro-rata share offer - We will adjust the exercise price of the option in the manner set out in the ASX Listing Rules; and\nReorganisation - In respect of rights, if there is a bonus issue or reorganisation of the Company’s share capital, then the Board may adjust the number of rights or the number of underlying shares so that there is no advantage or disadvantage to the holder.\nHolders otherwise have no other entitlements to participate:\nin any new issue of the Company’s securities before they exercise their options/rights; or\nin a share issue of a body corporate other than ANZ (such as a subsidiary).\nFor equity grants made after 1 November 2012, any portion of the award which vests may, at the Board’s discretion, be satisfied by a cash equivalent payment rather than shares.\nExpensing\nWe expense the fair value of options/rights on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period and we recognise the expense as a share-based compensation expense with a corresponding increase in equity.\nCessation\nThe provisions that apply if the employee’s employment ends are in section 9.2.3 of the 2019 Remuneration Report in the ANZ 2019 Group Annual Report.\nDownward adjustment\nThe Company’s downward adjustment provisions are detailed in section 6.3 of the 2019 Remuneration Report in the ANZ 2019 Group Annual Report.\nOption Plans that operated during 2019 and 2018\ni) Performance Rights\nAllocation\nWe grant performance rights to selected employees as part of the Company’s incentive plans. Performance rights provide the holder with the right to acquire ANZ shares at nil cost, subject to a three-year vesting period1 and Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance hurdles. Further details on the performance hurdles are in section 6.2.3a of the 2019 Remuneration Report in the ANZ 2019 Group Annual Report.\nSatisfying vesting\nAny portion of the award of performance rights (that have met the performance hurdles) may be satisfied by a cash equivalent payment rather than shares at the Board’s discretion. All performance rights were satisfied through a share allocation, other than 47,195 performance rights (2018: none) for which Board discretion was exercised.\n2019 and 2018 grants\nDuring the 2019 year, we granted 885,810 performance rights (2018: 1,023,239).\nDownward adjustment\nBoard discretion was exercised to adjust downward 59,012 performance rights to zero in 2019 (2018: none).\n1 Four years for grants from 1 October 2019.\n74\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n27. EMPLOYEE SHARE AND OPTION PLANS (continued)\nii) Deferred Share Rights (no performance hurdles)\nAllocation\nDeferred share rights provide the holder with the right to acquire ANZ shares at nil cost after a specified vesting period. We adjust the fair value of rights for the absence of dividends during the restriction period.\nSatisfying vesting\nAny portion of the award of share rights may be satisfied by a cash equivalent payment rather than shares at the Board’s discretion. All share rights were satisfied through a share allocation, other than 68,357 deferred share rights (2018: 108,783) for which Board discretion was exercised.\n2019 and 2018 grants\nDuring the 2019 year, 2,078,427 deferred share rights (no performance hurdles) were granted (2018: 2,546,333).\nDownward adjustment\nBoard discretion was exercised to adjust downward 11,824 deferred share rights to zero in 2019 (2018: 1,638).\nOptions, Deferred Share Rights and Performance Rights on Issue\nAs at 30 October 2019, there were 615 holders of 4,173,045 deferred share rights on issue and 142 holders of 2,486,001 performance rights on issue.\nOptions/Rights Movements\nThis table shows the options/rights over unissued ANZ shares and their related weighted average (WA) exercise prices as at the beginning and end of 2019 and the movements during 2019:\nOpening balance 1 Oct 2018\nOptions/ rights granted\nOptions/ rights forfeited1\nOptions/ rights expired\nOptions/ rights exercised\nClosing balance 30 Sep 2019\nNumber of options/rights\n7,148,573\n2,964,237\n(1,589,109)\n0\n(1,835,163)\n6,688,538\nWA exercise price\n$0.00\n$0.00\n$0.00\n$0.00\n$0.00\n$0.00\nWA closing share price\n$26.66\nWA remaining contractual life\n1.9 years\nWA exercise price of all exercisable options/rights outstanding\n$0.00\nOutstanding exercisable options/rights\n181,581\nThis table shows the options/rights over unissued ANZ shares and their related weighted average exercise prices as at the beginning and end of 2018 and the movements during 2018:\nOpening balance 1 Oct 2017\nOptions/ rights granted\nOptions/ rights forfeited1\nOptions/ rights expired\nOptions/ rights exercised\nClosing balance 30 Sep 2018\nNumber of options/rights\n7,113,784\n3,569,572\n(2,043,209)\n(1,558)\n(1,490,016)\n7,148,573\nWA exercise price\n$0.00\n$0.00\n$0.00\n$0.00\n$0.00\n$0.00\nWA closing share price\n$28.43\nWA remaining contractual life\n2.1 years\nWA exercise price of all exercisable options/rights outstanding\n$0.00\nOutstanding exercisable options/rights\n67,666\n1.

EMPLOYEE SHARE AND OPTION PLANS (continued)\nFair Value Assumptions\nWhen determining the fair value, we apply the standard market techniques for valuation, including Monte Carlo and/or Black Scholes pricing models. We do so in accordance with the requirements of AASB 2 Share-based Payments. The models take into account early exercise of vested equity, non- transferability and internal/external performance hurdles (if any).\nThe table below shows the significant assumptions we used as inputs into our fair value calculation of instruments granted during the period. We present the values as weighted averages, but the specific values we use for each allocation are the ones we use for the fair value calculation.\n2019\n2018\nDeferred share rights\nPerformance rights\nDeferred share rights\nExercise price ($)\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\nShare closing price at grant date ($)\n25.83\n25.52\n29.24\nExpected volatility of ANZ share price (%)1\n20.0\n20.0\n20.0\nEquity term (years)\n2.5\n4.8\n2.4\nVesting period (years)\n2.1\n3.0\n2.1\nExpected life (years)\n2.1\n3.0\n2.1\nExpected dividend yield (%)\n6\n6\n5.75\nRisk free interest rate (%)\n1.96\n2.05\n1.65\nFair value ($)\n22.87\n9.40\n26.03\n1. Expected volatility represents a measure of the amount by which ANZ’s share price is expected to fluctuate over the life of the rights. The measure of volatility used in the model is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the historical share price over a deferred period of time preceding the date of grant. This historical average annualised volatility is then used to estimate a reasonable expected volatility over the expected life of the rights.\nSATISFYING EQUITY AWARDS All shares underpinning equity awards may be purchased on market, reallocated or be newly issued shares, or a combination.\nThe equity we purchased on market during the 2019 financial year (either under the ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan and the ANZ Share Option Plan, or to satisfy options or rights) for all employees amounted to 4,317,094 shares at an average price of $25.99 per share (2018: 3,936,773 shares at an average price of $29.00 per share).\nPerformance rights\n0.00\n29.21\n20.0\n5.0\n3.0\n3.0\n5.75\n1.95\n12.24\n76\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n28. RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES\nKEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL COMPENSATION\nKey Management Personnel (KMP) are defined as all directors and those executives who report directly to the CEO:\nwith responsibility for the strategic direction and management of a major income generating division; or\nwho control material income and expenses.\nKMP compensation included within total personnel expenses in Note 3 Operating Expenses as follows:\n20191 $000\n20181 $000\nShort-term benefits\n15,784\n19,497\nPost-employment benefits\n415\n333\nOther long-term benefits\n213\n150\nTermination benefits\n2,112\n454\nShare-based payments\n6,184\n8,910\nTotal\n24,708\n29,344\n1.\nIncludes former disclosed KMP until the end of their employment.\nKEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL LOAN TRANSACTIONS\nLoans made to KMP are made in the ordinary course of business and on normal commercial terms and conditions that are no more favourable than those given to other employees or customers, including: the term of the loan, security required and the interest rate. No amounts have been written off during the period, or individual provisions raised in respect of these balances. The aggregate of loans made, guaranteed or secured to KMP, including their related parties, were as follows:\n2019 $000\n2018 $000\nLoans advanced1,2\n13,536\n12,541\nInterest charged3\n285\n477\n1. Balances are at the balance sheet date (for KMP in office at balance sheet date) or at the date of cessation of former KMP. 2. Prior period has been restated to include credit card balances and exclude an available for redraw component of loan balances previously included within loans and advances. 3. Interest is for all KMP’s during the period.\nKEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL HOLDINGS OF ANZ SECURITIES\nKMP, including their related parties, held subordinated debt, shares, share rights and options over shares in the Company directly, indirectly or beneficially as shown below:\n2019 Number1\n2018 Number1\nShares, options and rights\n1,892,754\n2,293,271\nSubordinated debt 1.

The Company has reimbursed KMP for the costs incurred for certain administration and secretarial services associated with the performance of their duties. These transactions are conducted on normal commercial terms and conditions and no more favourable than those given to other employees or customers.\n77\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n28. RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES (continued)\nASSOCIATES\nDuring the course of the financial year, the Company conducted transactions with all associates on terms equivalent to those made on an arm’s length basis as shown below:\n2019 $000\nAmounts receivable from associates\n\nAmounts payable to associates\n697\nInterest income from associates\n\nOther expenses paid to associates\n7,624\nThere have been no material guarantees given or received. No amounts have been written-off during the period, or individual provisions raised in respect of these balances.\nSUBSIDIARIES\nWe disclose material controlled entities in Note 23 Shares in Controlled Entities. During the financial year, subsidiaries conducted transactions with each other and with associates on terms equivalent to those on an arm’s length basis. As of 30 September 2019, we consider all outstanding amounts on these transactions to be fully collectible.\nTransactions between the Company and its subsidiaries include providing a wide range of banking and other financial facilities. Details of amounts paid to, or received from, related parties, in the form of dividends or interest, are set out in Note 2 Operating Income.\nOther intragroup transactions include providing management and administrative services, staff training, data processing facilities, transfer of tax losses, and the leasing of property plant and equipment.\n2018 $000\n34,364\n608\n1,704\n6,735\n78\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n29.

Many of these facilities are expected to be only partially used, and others may never be used at all. As such, the total of the nominal principal amounts is not necessarily representative of future liquidity risks or future cash requirements. Based on the earliest date on which the Company may be required to pay, the total undrawn facilities of $171,881 million (2018: $164,944 million) mature within 12 months.\nGUARANTEES, LETTERS OF CREDIT AND PERFORMANCE CONTINGENCIES Guarantees and contingent liabilities relate to transactions that the Company has entered into as principal – including: guarantees, standby letters of credit and documentary letters of credit.\nDocumentary letters of credit involve the Company issuing letters of credit guaranteeing payment in favour of an exporter. They are secured against an underlying shipment of goods or backed by a confirmatory letter of credit from another bank.\nPerformance related contingents are liabilities that oblige the Company to make payments to a third party if the customer fails to fulfil its non- monetary obligations under the contract.\nTo reflect the risk associated with these transactions, we apply the same credit origination, portfolio management and collateral requirements that we apply to loans. The contract amount represents the maximum potential amount that we could lose if the counterparty fails to meet its financial obligations. As the facilities may expire without being drawn upon, the notional amounts do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements. Based on the earliest date on which the Company may be required to pay, the total guarantees and letters of credit of $20,375 million (2018: $16,363 million) and total performance related contingencies of $20,097 million (2018: $22,176 million) mature within 12 months.\nPROPERTY RELATED COMMITMENTS\n2019 $m\n2018 $m\nLease rentals\nLand and buildings\n1,699\n1,533\nFurniture and equipment\n58\n112\nTotal lease rental commitments1\n1,757\n1,645\nDue within 1 year\n304\n321\nDue later than 1 year but not later than 5 years\n868\n769\nDue later than 5 years\n585\n555\nTotal lease rental commitments1\n1,757\n1,645\n1.

COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS (continued)\nOTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nAs at 30 September 2019, the Company had contingent liabilities in respect of the matters outlined below. Where relevant, expert legal advice has been obtained and, in the light of such advice, provisions (refer to note 20) and/or disclosures as deemed appropriate have been made. In some instances we have not disclosed the estimated financial impact of the individual items either because it is not practicable to do so or because such disclosure may prejudice the interests of the Company.\nREGULATORY AND CUSTOMER EXPOSURES In recent years there has been an increase in the number of matters on which the Company engages with its regulators. There have also been significant increases in the nature and scale of regulatory investigations and reviews, civil and criminal enforcement actions (whether by court action or otherwise), formal and informal inquiries, regulatory supervisory activities and the quantum of fines issued by regulators, particularly against financial institutions both in Australia and globally. The Company has received various notices and requests for information from its regulators as part of both industry-wide and Company-specific reviews and has also made disclosures to its regulators at its own instigation. The nature of these interactions can be wide ranging and, for example, currently include a range of matters including responsible lending practices, product suitability and distribution, interest and fees and the entitlement to charge them, customer remediation, wealth advice, insurance distribution, pricing, competition, conduct in financial markets and financial transactions, capital market transactions, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations, reporting and disclosure obligations and product disclosure documentation. There may be exposures to customers which are additional to any regulatory exposures. These could include class actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities. The outcomes and total costs associated with such reviews and possible exposures remain uncertain.\nBANK FEES LITIGATION AND PERIODICAL PAYMENT REMEDIATION AND ASIC ACTION A litigation funder commenced a class action against the Company in 2010, followed by a second similar class action in March 2013. The applicants contended that certain exception fees (honour, dishonour and non-payment fees on transaction accounts and late payment and over-limit fees on credit cards) were unenforceable penalties and that various of the fees were also unenforceable under statutory provisions governing unconscionable conduct, unfair contract terms and unjust transactions. The claims in the March 2013 class action failed and have been dismissed.\nThe original claims in the 2010 class action have been dismissed. In 2017, a new claim was added to the 2010 class action, in relation to the Company’s entitlement to charge certain periodical payment non-payment fees. Part of the class of customers had already received remediation payments from the Company. An agreement to settle the claim was reached in December 2018. The settlement is subject to court approval.\nIn July 2019, ASIC commenced civil penalty proceedings against the Company in relation to the charging of fees for periodical payments in certain circumstances between August 2003 and February 2016. ASIC seeks civil penalties in respect of alleged false or misleading representations and unconscionable conduct. ASIC also alleges that the Company engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct and breached certain statutory obligations as a financial services licensee. The matter is at an early stage. The outcomes and total costs remain uncertain. The Company is defending the allegations.\nBENCHMARK/RATE ACTIONS In July and August 2016, class action complaints were brought in the United States District Court against local and international banks, including the Company – one action relating to the bank bill swap rate (BBSW), and one action relating to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR) and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate (SOR). The class actions are expressed to apply to persons and entities that engaged in US-based transactions in financial instruments that were priced, benchmarked, and/or settled based on BBSW or SIBOR. The claimants seek damages or compensation in amounts not specified, and allege that the defendant banks, including the Company, violated US anti-trust laws and (in the BBSW case only) anti-racketeering laws, the Commodity Exchange Act, and unjust enrichment principles. The Company is defending the proceedings. The matters are at an early stage.\nIn February 2017, the South African Competition Commission commenced proceedings against local and international banks including the Company alleging breaches of the cartel provisions of the South African Competition Act in respect of trading in the South African rand. The potential civil penalty or other financial impact is uncertain. The matter is at an early stage.\nCAPITAL RAISING ACTIONS In June 2018, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions commenced criminal proceedings against the Company and a senior employee alleging that they were knowingly concerned in cartel conduct by the joint lead managers of the Company’s August 2015 underwritten institutional equity placement of approximately 80.8 million ordinary shares. The matter is at an early stage. The Company and its senior employee are defending the allegations.\nIn September 2018, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) commenced civil penalty proceedings against the Company alleging failure to comply with continuous disclosure obligations in connection with the Company’s August 2015 underwritten institutional equity placement. ASIC alleges the Company should have advised the market that the joint lead managers took up approximately 25.5 million ordinary shares of the placement. The matter is at an early stage. The Company is defending the allegations.\n80\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n29. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS (continued)\nFRANCHISEE LITIGATION In February 2018, two related class actions were brought against the Company alleging breaches of contract and unconscionable conduct in relation to lending to 7-Eleven franchisees. An agreement to settle the claims against the Company was reached in March 2019. The settlement is subject to court approval.\nROYAL COMMISSION The Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry released its final report on 4 February 2019. The findings and recommendations of the Commission are resulting in additional costs and may lead to further exposures, including exposures associated with further regulator activity or potential customer exposures such as class actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities. The outcomes and total costs associated with these possible exposures remain uncertain.\nSECURITY RECOVERY ACTIONS Various claims have been made or are anticipated, arising from security recovery actions taken to resolve impaired assets. These claims will be defended.\nWARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES The Company has provided warranties, indemnities and other commitments in favour of the purchaser and other persons in connection with various disposals of businesses and assets and other transactions, covering a range of matters and risks. It is exposed to potential claims under those warranties, indemnities and commitments.\nCLEARING AND SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS The Company has a commitment to comply with rules governing various clearing and settlement arrangements which could result in a credit risk exposure and loss if another member institution fails to settle its payment clearing activities. The Company’s potential exposure arising from these arrangements is unquantifiable in advance.\nThe Company holds membership of central clearing houses, including ASX Clear (Futures), London Clearing House (LCH) SwapClear and RepoClear, Korea Exchange (KRX), Hong Kong Exchange (HKEX) and the Clearing Corporation of India. These memberships allow the Company to centrally clear derivative instruments in line with cross-border regulatory requirements. Common to all of these memberships is the requirement for the Company to make default fund contributions. In the event of a default by another member, the Company could potentially be required to commit additional default fund contributions which are unquantifiable in advance.\nPARENT ENTITY GUARANTEES The Company has issued letters of comfort and guarantees in respect of certain subsidiaries in the normal course of business. Under these letters and guarantees, the Company undertakes to ensure that those subsidiaries continue to meet their financial obligations, subject to certain conditions including that the entity remains a controlled entity of the Company.\nSALE OF GRINDLAYS BUSINESSES On 31 July 2000, the Company completed the sale to Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) of ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited and the private banking business of ANZ in the United Kingdom and Jersey, together with ANZ Grindlays (Jersey) Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries, for USD1.3 billion in cash. The Company provided warranties and certain indemnities relating to those businesses and, where it was anticipated that payments would be likely under the warranties or indemnities, made provisions to cover the anticipated liabilities. The issue below has not adversely impacted the reported results. All settlements and penalties to date have been covered within existing provisions.\nIn 1991 certain amounts were transferred from non-convertible Indian Rupee accounts maintained with Grindlays in India. These transactions may not have complied with the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973. Grindlays, on its own initiative, brought these transactions to the attention of the Reserve Bank of India. The Indian authorities served notices on Grindlays and certain of its officers in India and civil penalties have been imposed which are the subject of appeals. Criminal prosecutions are pending and will be defended. The amounts in issue are not material.\nCONTINGENT ASSETS\nNATIONAL HOUSING BANK The Company is pursuing recovery of the proceeds of certain disputed cheques which were credited to the account of a former Grindlays customer in the early 1990s.\nThe disputed cheques were drawn on the National Housing Bank (NHB) in India. Proceedings between Grindlays and NHB concerning the proceeds of the cheques were resolved in early 2002.\nRecovery is now being pursued from the estate of the Grindlays customer who received the cheque proceeds. Any amounts recovered are to be shared between the Company and NHB.\n81\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n30.

Inclusive of goods and services tax.\nThe Company’s policy allows KPMG Australia or any of its related practices to provide assurance and other audit-related services that, while outside the scope of the statutory audit, are consistent with the role of external auditor. These include regulatory and prudential reviews requested by regulators such as APRA. Any other services that are not audit or audit-related services are non-audit services. The Policy allows certain non-audit services to be provided where the service would not contravene auditor independence requirements. KPMG Australia or any of its related practices may not provide services that are perceived to be in conflict with the role of the external auditor or breach auditor independence. These include consulting advice and subcontracting of operational activities normally undertaken by management, and engagements where the auditor may ultimately be required to express an opinion on its own work.\n2018 $’000\n6,674\n4,152\n100 10,926\n1,642\n545\n2\n2,189\n13,115\n82\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n31.

The Company adopted AASB 15 in this reporting period with comparatives restated. The impact of this policy change on the reported 30 September 2018 balance sheet was an increase in Other assets of $32 million, an increase in Deferred tax liabilities of $10 million and an increase in Retained earnings of $22 million, reflecting revenue that qualifies for upfront recognition under AASB 15 but was not previously recognised under AASB 118.\nIn addition to the balance sheet impact above, upon adoption of AASB 15 certain items previously netted are now presented gross in operating income and operating expenses. This increased total operating income and total operating expenses by $122m for the 2019 financial year. Comparative information has been restated which increased total operating income and total operating expenses by $146 million for the 2018 financial year.\nImpact of the transition to AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9)\nALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES\nThe table below reconciles the closing provisions for credit impairment of financial assets determined in accordance with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and provisions for credit impairment of loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts determined in accordance with AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets as at 30 September 2018, and the opening allowance for expected credit losses determined in accordance with AASB 9 as at 1 October 2018.\nAs at 30 Sep 18\nAs at 1 Oct 18\nProvision for credit impairment under AASB 139 or AASB 137 $m\nIncremental allowance for ECL under AASB 9 $m\nAllowance for ECL under AASB 9 $m\nLoans and advances - at amortised cost\n2,348\n583\n2,931\nInvestment securities - debt securities at amortised cost\n\n1\n1\nOff-balance sheet commitments - undrawn and contingent facilities1\n432\n143\n575\nTotal provisions for credit impairment\n2,780\n727\n3,507\nLoss allowances recognised in other comprehensive income\nInvestment securities - debt securities at FVOCI2\n\n4\n4\nTotal loss allowance recognised in other comprehensive income\n\n4\n4\n1.

IMPACT OF ADOPTION OF NEW STANDARDS AND OTHER CHANGES (continued)\nREFERENCE\n1. On initial application of AASB 9, a portfolio of bonds with a fair value of $1,000 million was transferred from Trading securities to Investment securities - debt securities at FVOCI as the applicable business model was held to collect and sell. Cumulative fair value gains/(losses) on this portfolio of $2 million (after-tax) were transferred from Retained earnings to the FVOCI reserve. Additionally, the reclassification resulted in a reduction in deferred tax assets and current tax liabilities of $1 million. The Available-for-sale classification is no longer applicable under AASB 9. Accordingly, on transition:\n1. On initial application of AASB 9, a portfolio of bonds with a fair value of $1,000 million was transferred from Trading securities to Investment securities - debt securities at FVOCI as the applicable business model was held to collect and sell. Cumulative fair value gains/(losses) on this portfolio of $2 million (after-tax) were transferred from Retained earnings to the FVOCI reserve. Additionally, the reclassification resulted in a reduction in deferred tax assets and current tax liabilities of $1 million. The Available-for-sale classification is no longer applicable under AASB 9. Accordingly, on transition:\n\n$61,823 million of Available-for-sale debt instruments were reclassified to Investment securities - debt securities at FVOCI due to the business model being held to collect and sell. There was no re-measurement impact associated with this reclassification;\n\n$1,818 million of Available-for-sale debt instruments were reclassified to Investment securities - debt securities at amortised cost due to the business model being held to collect at 1 October 2018. This reclassification resulted in re-measurement of a $1 million increase to the carrying amount arising from reversal of the previous available-for-sale revaluation reserve;\n\nthe Company made irrevocable elections to designate $1,086 million of non-traded Available-for-sale equity securities as Investment securities - equity securities at FVOCI; and\n\n$1 million of Available-for-sale equity securities were reclassified to Trading securities.\n3. Certain loans with contractual cash flow characteristics that are not solely payments of principal and interest were reclassified from Net loans and advances at amortised cost to Net loans and advances at FVTPL. The loans had an amortised cost carrying amount of $224 million and a fair value of $201 million at 30 September 2018. The associated re-measurement of $23 million was recognised in Retained earnings offset by a decrease in current tax liabilities of $7 million. In addition, one of the loans was previously in a fair value hedge relationship which was discontinued effective 1 October 2018. Accordingly, changes in the fair value due to changes in the hedged risk which were previously recognised as a reduction to the carrying value of the loan amounting to $15 million were written back to Retained earnings offset by an increase in current tax liabilities of $4 million. The Company elected to designate certain financial liabilities (bonds included within Debt issuances) as measured FVTPL effective from 1 October 2018 to reduce an accounting mismatch. The bonds had an amortised cost carrying amount of $879 million and a fair value of $824 million at 30 September 2018. The difference of $55 million (comprising a $109 million decrease in fair value before own credit, offset by a $54 million increase in fair value attributable to own credit) offset by a net tax impact of $17 million (increase in deferred tax asset of $17 million and an increase in current tax liability of $34 million) was recognised in Retained earnings.\n5. Certain capital notes with contractual cash flow characteristics that are not solely payments of principal and interest were reclassified from Due from controlled entities at amortised cost to Due from controlled entities at FVTPL. The capital notes had an amortised cost of $1,800 million and a fair value of $1,949 million at 30 September 2018. In addition, the Company elected to designate debt issuances previously measured at amortised cost as measured at FVTPL effective from 1 October 2018 to reduce an accounting mismatch. The debt issuances had an amortised cost carrying amount of $1,786 million (comprising $1,767 million recognised in Debt issuances plus $19 million relating to accrued interest recognised in Payables and other liabilities) and a fair value of $1,923 million at 30 September 2018. The net re-measurement impact $12 million was recognised in Retained earnings offset by a $4 million increase in deferred tax liabilities. The initial application of the expected credit loss requirements of AASB 9, resulted in increases in allowances for credit impairment attributable to the following:\nOn-balance sheet loans and advances of $583 million reflected in Net loans and advances at amortised cost;\nDebt securities of $1 million reflected in Investment securities – debt securities at amortised cost; and\nOff-balance sheet credit related commitments of $143 million reflected in Other provisions.\nThe total impact of $727 million was recognised as a reduction to Retained earnings, offset by an increase of $207 million related to deferred tax. Additionally, loss allowances of $2 million (after-tax) attributable to Investment securities - debt securities at FVOCI have been recognised in Reserves with a corresponding adjustment to Retained earnings. The debt securities remain at fair value on the face of the Balance Sheet.\n7. On initial application of AASB 9, a portfolio of Negotiable Certificates of Deposit with a carrying amount of $659 million was reclassified from Net loans and advances at amortised cost to Investment securities - debt securities at amortised cost. There was no re-measurement impact associated with this reclassification.\n8. On initial application of AASB 9, loans with a carrying amount and fair value of $1,340 million that were in the process of being syndicated were reclassified from Net loans and advances at amortised cost to Net Loans and advances at FVTPL on the basis that the applicable business model is held-to-sell. There was no re-measurement impact associated with this reclassification.\n85\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n32. EVENTS SINCE THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR\nOn 17 October the Company announced it had agreed a revised price for the sale of its OnePath P&I business and ADGs to IOOF of $850 million, being a $125 million reduction from the original sale price of $975 million announced in October 2017. The new price of $850 million includes ~$25 million that ANZ has already received for the sale of ADGs in October 2018. The revised terms reflect changing market conditions and include lower overall warranty caps as well as some changes to the strategic alliance arrangements. Subject to APRA approval, the Company expects the transaction to complete in the first quarter of calendar year 2020. The impact of the reduction in price has been reflected in the 2019 financial results.\nOther than the matter above, there have been no significant events from 30 September 2019 to the date of signing this report.\n86\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDIRECTORS’ AND LEAD AUDITOR’S INDEPENDENCE DECLARATION\nDIRECTORS’ DECLARATION\nThe Directors of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited declare that:\na) in the Directors’ opinion, the financial statements and notes of the Company:\ni) are prepared in accordance with Part 7.8 of the Corporations Act 2001, including that they comply with the Australian Accounting Standards and\nthe applicable regulations of the Corporations Regulations 2001; and\nii) give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company as at 30 September 2019 and of its performance for the year ended on that\ndate; and\nb) The auditor’s report lodged with the financial statements is a true copy of the report on the financial statements.\nSigned in accordance with a resolution of the Directors.\nDavid M Gonski, AC Chairman\n30 October 2019\nShayne C Elliott Director\nLEAD AUDITOR'S INDEPENDENCE DECLARATION UNDER SECTION 307C OF THE CORPORATIONS ACT 2001\nTo the Directors of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited declare that:\nI declare that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, in relation to the audit of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited for the financial year ended 30 September 2019 there have been:\ni) no contraventions of the auditor independence requirements as set out in the Corporations Act 2001 in relation to the audit; and\nii) no contraventions of any applicable code of professional conduct in relation to the audit.\nKPMG\nAlison Kitchen Partner Melbourne\n30 October 2019\n87\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT\nTO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND BANKING GROUP LIMITED\nREPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL REPORT\nOPINION\nWe have audited the Financial Report of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (the Company).\nIn our opinion, the accompanying Financial Report of the Company is in accordance with part 7.8 of the Corporations Act 2001, including:\ngiving a true and fair view of the Company’s financial position as at 30 September 2019 and of its financial performance for the year ended on that date; and\ncomplying with Australian Accounting Standards and the relevant Corporations Regulations 2001.\nThe Financial Report comprises the:\nstatement of financial position as at 30 September 2019;\nincome statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and statement of cash flows for the year then ended;\nnotes 1 to 32 including a summary of significant accounting policies; and\nDirectors’ Declaration.\nBASIS FOR OPINION\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report section of our report.\nWe are independent of the Company in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the Financial Report in Australia. We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.\nKEY AUDIT MATTERS\nThe Key Audit Matters we identified are:\nAllowance for expected credit losses;\nValuation of Financial Instruments held at Fair Value;\nProvision for Customer Remediation; and\nIT Systems and Controls.\nKey Audit Matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Report of the current period.\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n88\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nKEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued)\nALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES ($2,921M)\nRefer to the critical accounting estimates and judgements and disclosures in relation to allowance for expected credit losses in Note 12 to the Financial Report.\nThe Key Audit Matter AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9) was adopted by the Company on 1 October 2018. This is a key audit matter due to the significance of the loans and advances balance to the financial statements and the inherent complexity of the Company’s Expected Credit Loss (ECL) models (ECL models) used to measure ECL allowances. This new and complex accounting standard requires the Company to recognise ECLs on its loans and advances and off-balance sheet positions; the Company developed new models which are reliant on data as well as a number of estimates including the impact of multiple economic scenarios and other assumptions such as defining a significant increase in credit risk (SICR). This involves significant judgement and estimates and takes into account forward looking information reflecting potential future economic events.\nAASB 9 requires the Company to measure ECLs on a forward-looking basis reflecting a range of future economic conditions, including key forward- looking assumptions such as forecast GDP and unemployment levels. Post-model adjustments to the ECL results are also made by the Company to address known ECL model limitations or emerging trends in the loan portfolios. We exercise significant judgement in challenging the economic scenarios used and the judgemental overlays the Company applied to the ECL results.\nThe criteria selected to identify a SICR, such as a decrease in customer credit rating (CCR), are key areas of judgement within the Company’s ECL methodology as these criteria determine if a forward-looking 12 month or lifetime allowance is recorded.\nSeparate from the ECL calculation, allowances for individually assessed loans exceeding specific thresholds are individually assessed by the Company. These specific allowances are established based on the expected future cash repayments and estimated proceeds from the value of the collateral held by the Company in respect of the loans.\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit Our audit procedures for the allowance for ECL and disclosures for the year ended 30 September 2019 included assessing the Company’s significant accounting policies against the requirements of the accounting standard. Additionally our procedures covered:\nWe tested key controls in relation to:\nThe Company’s ECL model governance and validation processes;\nThe Company’s assessment and approval of the forward looking macroeconomic assumptions and scenario weightings through challenge applied by the Company’s internal governance processes;\nReconciliation of the data used in the ECL calculation process to gross balances recorded within the general ledger as well as source systems;\nTesting the key controls over counterparty risk grading for wholesale loans (larger customer exposures are monitored individually). We tested the approval of new lending facilities against the Company’s lending policies, and controls over the monitoring of counterparty credit quality. This included testing controls over the identification of exposures showing signs of stress, either due to internal factors specific to the counterparty or external macroeconomic factors, and testing the timeliness of and the accuracy of counterparty risk assessments and risk grading against the requirements of the Company’s lending policies and regulatory requirements; and\nFor retail loans, testing controls over the systems which record lending arrears, group exposures into delinquency buckets, and re-calculate individual allowances. We tested automated calculation and change management controls and evaluated the Company’s oversight of the portfolios, with a focus on controls over delinquency monitoring. We tested a sample of the level of allowances held against different loan products based on the delinquency profile and challenged assumptions made in respect of expected recoveries, including from collateral held.\nWe also tested relevant General Information Technology Controls (GITCs) over the key IT applications used by the Company in measuring ECL allowances as detailed in the IT Systems and Controls key audit matter below.\nIn addition to controls testing, our procedures included:\nPerforming credit assessments of a sample of wholesale loans controlled by the Company’s specialist workout and recovery team assessed as higher risk or impaired, and a sample of other loans, focusing on larger exposures assessed by the Company as showing signs of deterioration, or in areas of emerging risk (assessed against external market conditions). We challenged the Company’s risk grading of the loan, assessment of loan recoverability, valuation of security and the impact on the credit allowance. To do this, we used the information on the Company’s loan file, understood the facts and circumstances of the case with the loan officer, and performed our own assessment of recoverability. Exercising our judgment, our procedures included using our understanding of relevant industries and the macroeconomic environment and comparing data and assumptions used by the Company in recoverability assessments to externally sourced evidence, such as commodity prices, publicly available audited financial statements and comparable external valuations of collateral held. Where relevant we assessed the forecast timing of future cash flows in the context of supporting valuations and approved business plans and challenged key assumptions implicit in the valuations;\nObtaining an understanding of the Company’s processes to determine ECL allowances, evaluating the Company’s ECL model methodologies against established market practices and criteria in the accounting standards;\n89\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (continued)\nKEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued)\nWorking with KPMG Risk Consulting specialists, we assessed the accuracy of the Company’s ECL model predictions by re-performing, for a sample of loans, the ECL allowance and comparing this to the amount recorded by the Company;\nWorking with KPMG Economic specialists, we challenged the Company’s forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions and scenarios incorporated in the Company’s ECL models. We compared the Company’s forecast GDP and unemployment rates to relevant publicly available macro-economic information, and considered other known variables and information obtained through our other audit procedures to identify contradictory indicators;\nTesting the implementation of the Company’s SICR methodology by re-performing the staging calculation for a sample of loans and comparing our expectation to actual staging applied on an individual account level, taking into consideration movements in CCR; and\nAssessing the accuracy of the data used in the ECL models by confirming a sample of data fields such as account balance and CCR to relevant source systems.\nWe also challenged key assumptions in the components of the Company’s post-model adjustments to the ECL allowance balance. This included:\nEvaluating underlying data used in concentration risk and economic cycle allowances by comparing underlying portfolio characteristics to recent loss experience, current market conditions and specific risks inherent in the Company’s loan portfolios;\nAssessing the requirement for other additional allowances considering the Company’s ECL model and data deficiencies identified by the Company’s ECL model validation processes, and\nAssessing the completeness of additional allowance overlays by checking the consistency of risks we identified in the portfolios against the Company’s assessment.\nAASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Assessing the appropriateness of the Company’s disclosures in the financial report using our understanding obtained from our testing against the requirements of the accounting standard.\nVALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD AT FAIR VALUE - -\nASSETS HELD AT FAIR VALUE $222,093M LIABILITIES HELD AT FAIR VALUE $124,398M\nRefer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures of fair values in Note 16 to the Financial Report.\nThe Key Audit Matter Financial instruments held at fair value on the Company’s balance sheet include investment securities, trading securities, derivative assets and liabilities, certain debt securities, and other assets and liabilities designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income. The instruments are mainly risk management products sold to customers and used by the Company to manage its own interest rate and foreign exchange risk.\nThe valuation of financial instruments held at fair value is considered a Key Audit Matter as:\nFinancial instruments held at fair value are significant (25% of assets and 14% of liabilities);\nThe significant volume and range of products transacted, in a number of international locations, increases the risk of inconsistencies in transaction management processes that could lead to inaccurate valuation;\nDetermining the fair value of trading securities and derivatives involves a significant level of judgement by the Company, increasing the risk of error, and adding complexity to our audit. The level of judgement increases where internal models, as opposed to quoted market prices, are used to determine fair value of an instrument, or where inputs to the internal models, such as discount rates and measures of volatility, are not observable; or where there are a greater number of variables, including trade economic details and modelling assumptions, which feed into the internal models; and\nThe valuation of certain derivatives held by the Company is sensitive to inputs including funding rates, probabilities of default and loss given default. Both funding and credit risk are incorporated within the valuation of certain derivative instruments. This increased our audit effort in this area and necessitated the involvement of valuation specialists.\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit Our audit procedures for the valuation of financial instruments held at fair value included:\nTesting access rights and change management controls for key valuation systems;\n Testing interface controls, notably the completeness and accuracy of data transfers between transaction processing systems, key systems used to\ngenerate valuations and any related valuation adjustments, and the Company’s market risk management and finance systems to identify inconsistencies in transaction management and valuation processes across products and locations;\n90\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nKEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued)\nTesting the governance and approval controls, such as management review and approval of the valuation models, and approval of new products against policies and procedures;\nTesting the front office management review and approval of the daily financial instrument trading profit and loss reconciliations prepared by the Company’s independent markets and treasury control;\nTesting the management review and approval of model construction and validation, aimed at assessing the validity and robustness of underlying valuation models; and\nTesting the Company’s data validation controls, such as those over key inputs in generating the fair value to market data where fair values were determined by front office teams.\nWe carried out testing over the valuation of financial instruments with both observable and unobservable inputs. Our specific testing involved valuation specialists and included:\nRe-performing the valuation of ‘level 1’ and ‘level 2’ investment securities and trading securities, which are primarily government, semi- government and corporate debt securities, by comparing the observable inputs, including quoted prices, to independently sourced market data;\nUsing independent models, re-calculating the valuation of a sample, across locations, of derivative assets and liabilities where the fair value was determined using observable inputs. This included comparing a sample of observable inputs used in the Company’s derivative valuations to independently-sourced market data, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and volatilities;\nWhere the fair value of derivatives and other financial assets and liabilities were determined using unobservable inputs (‘level 3’ instruments), challenging the Company’s valuation model by testing the key inputs used to comparable data in the market, including the use of proxy instruments and available alternatives. We compared the Company’s valuation methodology to industry practice and the criteria in the accounting standards; and\nEvaluating the appropriateness of the Company’s valuation methodology for derivative financial instruments, having regard to current and emerging derivative valuation practices across a range of peer institutions, and against the required criteria in the accounting standards. We tested adjustments made to valuations, particularly funding and credit valuation adjustments on un-collateralised derivatives. In particular, for a sample of individual counterparties, across locations, we tested key inputs to the credit valuation adjustment calculation, including the probability of default, against observable market data. Where proxies were used, we assessed the proxy against available alternatives, across a number of locations.\nPROVISION FOR CUSTOMER REMEDIATION ($967M) Refer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures in Notes 20 to the Financial Report.\nThe Key Audit Matter The Company has assessed the need to recognise provisions in relation to certain customer remediation activities arising from both internal and external investigations and reviews. This includes provisions for expected refunds to customers, remediation project costs and related customer and regulatory claims, penalties, and litigation outcomes.\nThe provision for customer remediation activities is a Key Audit Matter due to the number of investigations, the quantum of amounts involved, and the judgements required by us in assessing the Group’s determination of:\nThe existence of a present legal or constructive obligation arising from a past event using the conditions of the event against the criteria in the accounting standards;\nReliable estimates of the amounts which may be paid arising from investigations, including estimates of related costs and regulatory penalties;\nThe potential for legal proceedings, further investigations, and reviews from its regulators leading to a wider range of estimation outcomes for us to consider.\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit Our audit procedures for customer remediation provisions included:\nObtaining an understanding of the Company’s processes for identifying and assessing the potential impact of customer remediation payments, related project costs and legal proceedings associated with compliance matters, investigations and reviews from its regulators;\nEnquiring with the Company regarding ongoing legal and regulatory matters, and investigation into other remediation activities;\nEnquiries with external legal counsel;\nReading the minutes and other relevant documentation of the Company’s Board of Directors, Board Committees, various management committees, and attending the Company’s Audit and Risk Committee meetings;\nInspecting correspondence with relevant regulatory bodies;\n For a sample of individual exposures, assessing the basis for recognition and measurement of a provision and associated costs against the requirements of the accounting standards. We did this by understanding and challenging the provisioning methodologies and underlying assumptions;\n91\nANZ 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (continued)\nKEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued)\nTesting completeness by evaluating where exposures may have arisen based upon our knowledge and experience of broader industry matters, the Company's documentation of compliance matters and customer complaints and the current regulatory environment. We also checked features of these exposures against the criteria defining a provision or a contingency in the accounting standards;\nAssessing the appropriateness of the Company’s conclusions against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards where estimates were unable to be reliably made for a provision to be recognised;\nEvaluating the related disclosures against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\nIT SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS The Key Audit Matter As a major Australian bank, the Company’s businesses utilise a large number of complex, interdependent Information Technology (IT) systems to process and record a high volume of transactions. Controls overaccess and changes to IT systems are critical to the recording of financial information and the preparation of a financial report which provides a true and fair view of the Company’s financial position and performance.\nThe IT systems and controls, as they impact the financial recording and reporting of transactions, is a key Audit matter and our audit approach could significantly differ depending on the effective operation of the Company’s IT controls. KPMG IT specialists were used throughout the engagement as a core part of our audit team.\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit We tested the technology control environment for key IT applications (systems) used in processing significant transactions and recording balances in the general ledger. We also tested automated controls embedded within these systems which support the effective operation of technology-enabled business processes. Our audit procedures included:\nAssessing the governance and higher-level controls in place across the IT Environment, including the approach to Company policy design, review and awareness, and IT Risk Management practices;\nDesign and operating effectiveness testing of controls across the User Access Management Lifecycle, including how users are on-boarded, reviewed, and removed on a timely basis from critical IT applications and supporting infrastructure. We also looked at how privileged roles and functions are managed across each IT Application and the supporting infrastructure;\nDesign and operating effectiveness testing of controls in place to enable Change Management including how changes are initiated, documented, approved, tested and authorised prior to migration into the production environment of critical IT Applications. We also assessed the appropriateness of users with access to make changes to IT applications across the Company;\nDesign and operating effectiveness testing of controls used by the Company’s technology teams to schedule system jobs and monitor system integrity;\nDesign and operating effectiveness testing of controls in place to support Program Development, including the implementation of revised guidelines per the new ANZ Delivery Framework; and\nDesign and operating effectiveness testing of automated business process controls include those that enforce segregation of duties conflicts between toxic role combinations within IT applications, configurations in place to perform calculations, mappings, and flagging of financial transactions, automated reconciliation controls, both between systems and intra-system and data integrity of critical system reporting used for sampling, data analysis and financial reporting across the audit.\n92\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS FOR THE FINANCIAL REPORT\nThe Directors are responsible for:\npreparing a Financial Report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001;\nimplementing necessary internal control to enable the preparation of a Financial Report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and\nassessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and whether the use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate. This includes disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL REPORT\nOur objective is:\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and\nto issue an Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion.\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the Financial Report.\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report is located at the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board website at: http://www.auasb.gov.au/auditors_responsibilities/ar2.pdf.

The report confirmed we had taken up many of their recommendations, however there were some suggestions for improvement. For example, it was suggested we provide information on customers beyond the thermal coal supply chain and risks, particularly physical risks. In response we have provided disclosures on our agribusiness sector in the ‘Strategy’ section below.\nIn 2019 we have focused on: * training our people on climate-related risks and opportunities; * engaging with our largest emitting customers on their transition plans; and\n« feeding the results of our customer engagement into our assessments of individual customers and carbon-intensive portfolios, in particular the energy, transport, buildings and food, beverage and agricultural sectors.\nContents\nOur progress in aligning with the TCFD 3 Risk Management\nGovernance 4 Metrics and Targets 8 Strategy 4 Financed Emissions 10\nANZ 2019 CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES\nOur progress in aligning w\nTCFD theme\nGovernance\nStrategy\nMetrics and targets\nOur progress to date\nFocus areas - 2020/21\nBoard Risk Committee oversees management of\nclimate-related risks\nBoard Ethics, Environment, Social and Governance Committee approves climate-related objectives,\ngoals and targets\nEthics and Responsible Business Committee (executive management) oversees our approach to sustainability and reviews climate-related risks\nANZ's Climate Change Statement (available on anz.com) reaffirms support for the Paris Agreement goals and the transition to a net-zero carbon economy\nManaging the net-zero carbon transition focuses on an orderly and just transition that gives careful consideration to the impacts on communities\nParticipation in a United Nations Environment Programme\nFinance Initiative (UNEP Fl) working group on TCFD scenario\nanalysis that issued recommendations and methods to assess portfolio transition and physical risks\nLow carbon products and services within our Institutional business focused on climate-related opportunities\nAnalysis of flood-relate\nrisks for our home loan portfolio\nin a major regional location of Australia\nresilience of home loan\nClimate change risk ad\nin our UK Disclosure ani\nEnhanced financial ana terms applied to agricu\nRisk Appetite Statements\nTest-pilot of socio-economic indicators showing financial\ncustomers with respect to flood risk\nled to Group and Institutional\nClimate change identified as a Principal Risk and Uncertainty\nTransparency Rules (DTR) Submission\nGuidelines and training provided to over 1,000 of our nstitutional bankers on customer transition plan discussions\nlysis and stronger credit approval\ntural property purchases in regions\nof low average rainfall or measured variability\nNew agribusiness customers assessed for financial resilience and understanding of rainfall and climate trends in their area, and water budgets considered if irrigating\nSupport 100 of our largest emitting customers’ to establish or strengthen low carbon transition plans by 2021, with metrics developed to track their progress\nExceeded our 5-year $15 billion target to fund and facilitate low carbon and environmentally sustainable solutions\nPower Purchase Agreement to increase renewable energy use in our Australian operations\nOngoing emissions reduction targets for ANZ energy use aligned with the Paris Agreement goals\nIn the energy, transport, buildings and food, beverage and\nagricultural sectors\nAlign with regulatory guidance on climate-related risk governance, including stress testing of selected portfolios\nConsider extending scenario analysis to incorporate bushfire, flood and other risks relating\nto retail customers\nossible extension of emerging environmental and climate-related risks to other segments of the ome loan portfolio\nnclude climate risk reference in Agriculture related lending guidance documents used by our front line bankers\nEncourage customers to develop and disclose their transition plans in key sectors energy, transport, buildings and food, beverage and agriculture\nCustomer engagement\nto identify customer or sector-specific transition or physical risks\nComplete transition plan engagement with high emitting customers and consider how to integrate into customer assessments\n« New 6-year $50 billion\ntarget to fund and facilitate sustainable solutions\nNew metrics for measuring impact of our progress on environmental sustainability New target to procure 100%\nrenewable electricity for ANZ's operations by 2025\nBeyond 2020 vision\nAn enhanced risk management framework that is responsive\nto climate change,\nand meets financial regulators’ requirements\nANZ business strategy more closely aligned to a resilient and sustainable economy that supports the Paris Agreement goals and Sustainable Development Goals\nIntegrate assessment\nof climate-related risks into our Group risk management framework Standard with business customers include climate-related risks and opportunities\niscussions\nAssessment of customer transition plans part of standard lending decisions and portfolio analysis\nMonitor industry standards for lending aligned with the Paris Agreement goals\nReduce ANZ's operational emissions in line with the decarbonisation trajectory of the Paris Agreement goals\n4\nGovernance\nOur Board has the highest level of oversight for climate change with responsibilities also allocated to some sub-committees. The Ethics, Environment, Social and Governance (EESG) Committee of the Board meets quarterly and is responsible for reviewing and approving our climate-related objectives and performance, including goals and targets to support action on climate change. The Board Risk Committee has responsibility for the overview of ANZ's management of new and emerging risks, including climate-related risks.\nAt an executive level, the Ethics and Responsible Business Committee (ERBC) sets our policy as detailed in our Climate\nChange Statement. The ERBC provides leadership on our sustainability risks and opportunities, monitoring progress against our targets, including those related to climate change. The ERBC is also responsible for:\nguiding which industry sectors, customers and transactions we bank, to align with our purpose, strategy and values, and our public statements on issues such as climate change; and\nassessing current and emerging ethical, social, environmental and governance risks and opportunities.\nStrategy\nIdentification and management of our material sustainability\nrisks and opportunities, including those related to climate change, supports the achievement of our business strategy. Environmental sustainability is one of our key priorities and accordingly we are: establishing low carbon financial products and services; creating policies to guide which customers we bank; training staff on climate- related risks and seeking to reduce our own operational footprint.\nWe are supporting our customers to identify their risks and plan\nfor the transition, in addition to assisting customers that are able to create opportunities for affected communities. Each of our business areas needs to understand the risks and opportunities relevant to their customers — including those related to climate change.\nIn 2018 we worked with the United Nations Environment Programme for Financial Institutions (UNEP Fl) on a pilot scenario analysis project. We stress tested our agricultural portfolio for physical risk under two warming scenarios and the results were in line with our expectations — that customers with weaker credit profiles experienced more significant impacts of higher temperatures. This work is summarised in the UNEP FI report, ‘Navigating a New Climate: Assessing Credit Risk and Opportunity in a Changing Climate’?\nWe continue our UNEP FI involvement by providing advice to other participant banks who have joined the project in 2019. Risk specialists in our Australian agribusiness team have assisted other banks with the scenario analysis developed in 2018, enabling them to stress test their agriculture portfolios.\nSince 2016 we have also been working with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), using their mapping to identify parts of Australia with low rainfall and those areas more likely to experience rainfall variation. (Fig 1- Rainfall Annual 30-year average (1986-2015)). When customers purchase properties in these areas, we test their financial resilience to climatic events like rainfall variation and drought. Customers with lower resilience may be subject to enhanced underwriting standards, for example, loan approval may be dependent on a lower loan to valuation ratio, higher repayments, or evidence of savings or equity. Our bankers also need to document the customer's knowledge of recent rainfall and climate trends where their farm is located and, if relevant, how they manage water budgets for irrigation.\nThis year we extended these financial resilience tests to new customers in all drought-affected parts of New South Wales and Queensland. From 2020 we will consider measures to encourage customers to build climate resilience into their farm operating models, regardless of whether they are located in areas experiencing rainfall variability. In effect this means that our farming customers nationally would undergo testing for financial resilience to climate events such as rainfall variability. In addition, all farm purchases in Australia would require the customer's knowledge of climate and rainfall conditions and water budgets, to be documented.\nWe continue to work with Australia’s BOM as it improves its identification of areas potentially impacted by other climate factors such as drought, which reduces streamflow to irrigators, warmer than usual temperatures leading to accelerated evaporation, and heatwaves.\n2. See https://www.unepfi.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NAVIGATING-A-NEW-CLIMATE.pdf\nANZ 2019 CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES\nRisk Managemen\nClimate Risk Management\nWe have disclosed our most material social and environmental risks in our 2019 Annual Report (see page 46) on anz.com/annualreport in accordance with the ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations. Our most material climate-related risks and opportunities result from our lending to business and retail customers, including credit-related losses incurred as a result of a customer being unable to repay debt.\nUnder our risk management framework, our material risk category of Credit Risk incorporates the risks associated with lending to customers that could be impacted by climate change or by changes to laws, regulations, or other policies such as carbon pricing and climate change adaptation or mitigation policies. It also includes changes to the cost and level of insurance cover available to our customers.\nWe also specifically include climate change as one of our Principal Risks and Uncertainties (available on anz.com/annualreport). Climate change risk is included in the Group and Institutional Risk Appetite Statements to ensure the risk is appropriately identified and assessed.\nWe continue to develop an organisational culture that encourages regular discussion and consideration of emerging climate-related risks. Our Risk team is working with our bankers, encouraging them to talk with customers about managing the risks and opportunities associated with climate change, assisting us to progress our low carbon transition target focused on our largest emitting customers.\nRainfall Annual 30-year average (1986-2015)\nMillimeters. kKalumburu\nKatherine 3000\nKowanyama », Cairns\n‘© Normanton Broome\n3 a8 o 9° 66 8\n.

This engagement will inform the development of a model applicable to our broader customer base enabling us to encourage customers to improve the management and disclosure of their climate-related risks\nand opportunities.\nWithin each industry our customers have different starting points. Both through customer discussions and reviews of public disclosures we are developing a better understanding of our customers’ preparation for, and management of, their most\nlikely climate-related risks and opportunities.\nWhile acknowledging transition plans vary depending on\nthe sector, some sector-specific measures we expect are:\nenergy customers seeking to diversify energy sources towards less carbon-intensive fuels, and if diversification is not feasible within the period to 2030, can they discuss how their business is resilient under scenarios in which demand for their commodities declines more rapidly than a‘business as usual’ scenario;\ntransportation customers moving towards more fuel-efficient vehicle fleets or other measures that will reduce their carbon emissions;\nproperty developers or retailers reducing building energy consumption and refrigerant-based emissions using best available, commercially viable technologies; and,\n« food, beverage and agriculture customers switching to practices that lower energy use or non-energy emissions such as reforestation or energy efficient farm equipment.\nOur engagement with energy customers is well-progressed, especially amongst those with thermal coal operations. A number of them have already disclosed robust transition plans, while others have signalled an intention to improve disclosure. Our customer discussions have generally been well-received and have often revealed more detailed strategies and plans than were apparent from previous engagements. Insights we have gained from these early customer conversations include:\nEnergy: our engagement in this sector is initially focused on customers with thermal coal operations. Some customers see continuing strong demand for high quality, low-cost Australian thermal coal that will be used in recently built or planned high efficiency, lower emissions (HELE) plants across Asia. Their strategy is focused on developing high quality thermal coal assets and they are committed to improving their external disclosures. Other customers have undertaken scenario analysis (aligned with TCFD recommendations), revealing that some of their commodities perform worst under a low-carbon transition; in response they are directing limited expenditure to thermal coal and most of this is in maintenance capital rather than expansion. Some energy companies are also starting to work with their suppliers and customers to seek to reduce the emissions associated with the use of their mining commodities, ie ‘Scope 3’ emissions.\n3. See https://news.anz.com/posts/2019/may/low-carbon-transition-plans\nANZ 2019 CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES\nTransport: a significant customer has ambitious plans to expand their electric vehicle fleet in Australia and is building a new distribution centre that will integrate rooftop solar and electric vehicle charging bays. They also plan to enter a renewable energy power purchase agreement (PPA) to lower their carbon footprint and shield themselves from price volatility.\nBuildings: a number of customers have established net-zero carbon targets that will be achieved largely through improved energy efficiency and onsite solar installations, setting time bound goals to achieve this by 2030.\nFood, beverage and agriculture: for many of our agribusiness and food producers, the physical risks of climate change (eg. water availability and supply) represent the most material and immediate risk to their business, rather than transition risks. We have observed many soft commodity customers are increasingly focused on managing climate-related risks by committing to reduce or remove deforestation from their operations and supply chains.\nTo equip our staff with the skills and knowledge to undertake these customer engagements, in 2019 we provided training to over 1,000 frontline bankers in our Institutional and Corporate businesses. The training covered how climate-related risks and opportunities might manifest for our customers and what elements we would expect to see in a robust transition plan. Our Risk, Sustainable Development and Institutional ESG specialists assisted, attending team meetings and customer discussions about low carbon transition plans and the TCFD framework.\nResults of customer transition plan engagement\nANZ has defined three key elements that constitute a robust low-carbon transition plan for our customers regarding their level of governance, targets / long term plans and disclosures that are preferably TCFD-alignec®.\nOf the 29 customers that we engaged with during FY19, the diagram below show how many we have assessed to have met each of the three transition plan elements. In FY20, we will aim to meet with the remainder of our largest emitting customers to encourage and support them to develop transition plans that incorporate each of the three elements above.\nCustomer transition plan status 35\n30 25\n20\n: a fe)\nCustomers\nGovernance Targets/long term Disclosures plans TCFD-aligned Planned @ Yes «== Customers engaged\nHow we are responding\nBAU cycle\nStrategic segment management\nClimate-related cycle\nPortfolio assessment of carbon-intensive sectors\nANZ CUSTOMER\nPeriodic customer engagement\nOngoing credit review\nBAU staff training\n1. 2019 focus on ANZ staff managing specific higher carbon emitting customers\nWhilst it is important to have identified the sectors that are potentially at risk from climate change, to ensure transition risk is part of our future customer strategies, we will embed the results of our transition plan target into our customer due diligence.\nInitially, we are focused on sectors most likely to be impacted by climate change and we will use the results of this work to help understand risk exposure at a customer and an industry level. We will also use this to inform our engagement with customers and our risk evaluation\nof them, which we expect to increasingly inform our credit decisions.\nMANAGEMENT\nPeriodic custom engagement on transition plan\nDesktop research on customer disclosures and statements\nStaff training on low-carbon transition discussion!\nThe results of our customer due diligence will be incorporated to help us understand client exposure, and their strategic response to their climate risks and opportunities. This will help us to understand our customer's climate resilience and inform our actions and strategy.\nOur support for society's transition to a net-zero carbon economy, can be seen in ANZ's declining exposure to thermal coal mining, which has halved since 2015. This year we have again publicly disclosed our financial exposure to thermal coal and our overall exposures that include metallurgical coal mining.\n8\nMetrics ets\nTCFD-related metrics and industry exposures\nFor the second consecutive year we have disclosed credit metrics and our exposure to various sub-industries in four key sectors identified by the TCFD to be most exposed to climate-related risks: energy, transportation, materials and building, and agriculture, food and forestry products. This is in response to the TCFD recommendations that ‘banks should describe significant concentrations of credit exposure to carbon related assets“ and provide a breakdown of\nthis data by industry, geography, credit quality and average tenor.\nOur overall exposure to these four sectors is 20% of the Group exposure at default (EAD), up from 19% in the previous two years. In terms of credit metrics, we have observed a steady improvement in the percentage of exposures rated as investment grade with 51.5% of our exposures across the four sectors achieving this benchmark in FY19 compared to 44.1% in FY17. The higher proportion of our loans rated investment grade has been matched by a corresponding decrease in the proportion of loans rated as non-performing with 0.4% of our exposures across the four sectors falling into this category; down from 0.7% in FY17. The average loan term is relatively short for the majority of our exposures; 87% of total loans to customers in the four sectors are due for repayment in less than five years.\nANZ acknowledges stakeholder interest in banks’ exposure to the transition risks faced by some customers in the energy sector, including the potential risk of ‘stranded assets’ in the transition to a net-zero economy. For ANZ, transition risks may manifest as credit losses which can occur when a customer becomes unable or unwilling to repay debt. Our total exposure to the energy sector at the end of FY19 was $31.9b — which is just over 3% of the Group EAD. With more than 81% of these exposures rated as investment\n4. Implementing the Recommendations of the TCFD, June 2017 (p24)\nANZ 2019 CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES\ngrade, and a declining proportion of non-performing loans, it reflects our strategy to bank larger, well-rated clients, that are adapting their business strategies to pursue opportunities available in the long- term decarbonisation of the energy sector.\nAlso disclosed is a more detailed industry and sub-industry breakdown of our exposures to the four sectors identified by the TCFD (see following page).\nOur exposure to the most carbon-intensive forms of energy generation has declined since 2015. This decline is partly an outcome of active portfolio management, informed by our credit strategies. hese industry credit strategies (known as Risk Appetite Statements) reference our Climate Change Statement and relevant industry standards and they reflect risks associated with climate change, influencing decisions about business strategy and capital allocation.\nFor example we expect the decline in our exposures to thermal coal mining to continue over time and we will continue to disclose our progress. To help manage our exposures, we will also only consider lending to new customers involved in coal-related mining, transport and power generation if their thermal coal operations contribute less than 50% of their revenue, installed capacity or generation.\nWhile supporting our customers to reduce their emissions, we are also seeking to reduce the environmental impact of our own operations. We have a suite of environmental sustainability targets aimed at lowering our carbon emissions, reducing our water and paper consumption and increasing our recycling rates. See our 2019 ESG Supplement, to be released in December, for detail on how we have performed against these and our other targets.\nTCFD-Related Metrics and Industry Exposures\nIndustry groups and credit quality summary®\nExposure at Default (EAD) Non-performing loans Investment Grade\n(Sb) (% of sector EAD) (% of sector EAD) Group 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 Energy 31.9 28.7 283 0.1% 0.1% 0.3% 81.5% 80.0% 796% Transportation 18.8 16.6 15.5 0.2% 0.3% 0.8% 65.1% 63.7% 60.5% Materials and Building 100.3 92.5 85.8 0.4% 04% 0.6% 46.0% 40.9% 35.9% Agriculture, Food and Forestry 43.6 42.3 418 0.8% 0.9% 1.1% 36.2% 35.8% 30.7% Total 194.7 180.0 171.3 0.4% 0.5% 0.7% 51.5% 48.0% 44.1%\nExposures to key TCFD sub-industries Exposure at Default ($b)\nFY19 FY18 FY17\nOil and Gas 19.9 18.4 18.0 Energy Coal Mining® 1.5 14 1 Electric Utilities’ 10.4 89 91 Air Freight 3.8 34 33 Maritime Transportation 24 17 17 ail Transportation 17 2.0 15 Transportation tucking Services 5.6 47 5 Automobiles 5.3 47 37 assenger Air 0.1 0.1 03 Metals and Mining 8.6 67 67 Chemicals 3.2 26 19 Materials and Building Construction Materials 1.7 18 17 Capital Goods 22.0 203 19.5 Real Estate Management and Development 64.9 611 559 Beverages 3.2 3.0 29 Agriculture 31.6 31.2 30.7 Agriculture, Food and Forestry Packaged Foods and Meats 78 71 70 Paper and Forest Products 11 1.0 12 Total 194.7 180.0 171.3\n5.

Electric utilities includes exposures to electricity generators that own or operate a mix of thermal and renewable generation assets as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure\n10\nFinanced Emissions\nDirect financing of renewables projects has increased by 27% compared to the previous year. Renewable generation assets now comprise 83% of our total exposures to electricity generation assets in our project finance portfolio — up from 76% in FY18.\nOver the past year our financing has contributed to bringing online 488 megawatts (MW) of renewables projects in Australia, helping reduce the emissions intensity of the electricity generation assets we irectly finance to 0.54tCO2 for every megawatt-hour generated. This is 18% below the previous year and is the lowest level recorded for this metric in the six years we have reported it. With a further 859MW of solar and wind projects under construction and scheduled to come online in FY20, we expect to see continued reductions in the emissions intensity of our Australian-based generation portfolio. One of these projects is Stage 1 of the Kiamal Solar Farm located near\nthe Ouyen township in North-West Victoria. This project consists of 720,000 solar PV modules with a nameplate capacity of 256.5MWp%, which will not only support Australia’s long-term transition to cleaner energy, it has also helped to deliver social and economic benefits to the Mildura region. More than 300 jobs are being supported during the project's construction phase with long-term employment for\n10 skilled employees. Once operational, a voluntary community\nfund will be established to support initiatives in the Ouyen local community. No new thermal coal power projects were added to\nour Australian-based project finance portfolio over the past year.\nExplanatory notes Financed Emissions\nThe average emissions intensity of generation we finance continues to be well below the grid average in Australia of 0.79 tonnes of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour?.\nFor electricity generation assets located outside of Australia, the removal of a Southeast Asian coal-fired power station from our portfolio in the last 12 months has supported a record low emissions intensity of 0.02tCO2 for every megawatt-hour generated. For our international portfolio, all but a small proportion of our total limits are directed at wind, hydro and geothermal assets.\nTonnes CO,-e per MWh\nelectricity generated Australia Outside Australia 2019 0.54 0.02 2018 0.66 0.08 2017 0.58 0.24 2016 0.62 0.16 2015 0.64 0.20 2014 0.77 0.25 Movement\n2014-2019 -30% -92%\nReported figures reflect actual generation from financed assets over the period October 2018 to September 2019, or an annual reporting period as close to those dates as possible.

This UK DTR Submission has been prepared by ANZBGL in order to comply with the applicable periodic reporting requirements of DTR 4 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority in connection with certain debt securities issued by ANZBGL. For completeness, in addition to lodgement with the LSE, ANZBGL is lodging this UK DTR Submission with applicable exchanges, including the Australian Securities Exchange and the New Zealand Stock Exchange today.\nYours faithfully\nSimon Pordage Company Secretary Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited\nCompany Secretary’s Office ANZ Centre Melbourne, Level 9, 833 Collins Street, Docklands Vic 3008 GPO Box 254, MELBOURNE VIC 3001 AUSTRALIA www.anz.com\n4 November 2019\nDISCLOSURE AND TRANSPARENCY RULES – ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT SUBMISSION\nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (“ANZBGL” or the “Company”) together with its subsidiaries (“ANZ” or the “Group”) – Annual Financial Report submission under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (“DTR”) of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority\nThe following attached documents constitute ANZ’s 2019 Annual Financial Report for the purposes of the disclosure requirements of DTR 4.1:\nThe Group’s 2019 Annual Report for the year ended 30 September 2019;\nThe Company’s 2019 Financial Statements for the year ended 30 September 2019;\nA description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the Group provided in\naccordance with DTR 4.1.8 (2); and\nA responsibility statement of the Directors of ANZBGL provided in accordance with\nDTR 4.1.12 (3)(b).\n1\nANZ’s 2019 Annual Report and ANZBGL’s 2019 Financial Statements\nThese documents were separately lodged by ANZ with applicable stock exchanges, including the London Stock Exchange and the Australian Securities Exchange, on 4 November 2019.\n2\nPrincipal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group (DTR 4.1.8 (2))\nIntroduction\nThe Group’s activities are subject to risks that can adversely impact its business, operations, results of operations, reputation, prospects, liquidity, capital resources, financial performance and financial condition (together, the “Group’s Position”). The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that the Group may face. Additional risks and uncertainties that the Group is unaware of, or that the Group currently deems to be immaterial, may also become important factors that affect it. If any of the specified or unspecified risks actually occur, the Group’s Position may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks related to the Issuer's business activities and industry\n1. Changes in political and general business and economic conditions, including disruption in regional or global credit and capital markets, may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nThe Group’s financial performance is primarily influenced by the political and economic conditions and the level of business activity in the major countries and regions in which the Group or its customers or counterparties operate, trade or raise funding including, without limitation, Australia, New Zealand, the Asia Pacific, United Kingdom, Europe and the United States (the “Relevant Jurisdictions”).\nThe economic and business conditions that prevail in the Group’s major operating and trading markets are affected by, among other things, domestic and international economic events, political events and natural disasters, and by movements and events that occur in global financial markets.\nThe impact of the global financial crisis in 2007 and its aftermath continue to affect regional and global economic activity, confidence and capital markets. Prudential authorities continue to implement increased regulations in an attempt to mitigate the risk of such events recurring, although there can be no assurance that such regulations will be effective. The Group believes that the global financial crisis has also had a lasting effect on consumer and business behaviour in advanced economies, including the major countries and regions in which the Group or its customers or counterparties operate. Consumers in recent years have reduced their savings rates in the face of weak income growth, while businesses have been reluctant to invest and inflation has remained low. The potential for escalation in geopolitical risks has also contributed to vulnerability in consumer and business behavior. Monetary authorities responded to the global financial crisis by introducing zero or near-zero interest rates across most countries, and the major central banks took unconventional steps to support growth and raise inflation. Recently, some monetary authorities are taking similar actions due to current market conditions. For example, central banks worldwide, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the RBA and the RBNZ, cut interest rates in 2019.\nChanges in global political conditions have lead to, and may continue to result in extended periods of increased political and economic uncertainty and volatility in the global financial markets. Recent examples include the protracted “Brexit” (as defined below) negotiations, Donald Trump’s presidency and protectionist policies, and global trade developments relating to, among other things, the imposition or threatened imposition of trade tariffs and levies by major countries including by those that are Australia’s significant trading partners (for instance, changes in U.S. trade relations with China could affect economic activity in Australia). Such changes have reduced and could lead to a further reduction in consumer and business activity within the markets in which the Group or its customers or counterparties operate, or result in the introduction of new and/or divergent regulatory frameworks that the Group will need to adhere to.\nIn anticipation of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), the Group has made changes to the structure of its business operations in Europe, however the financial, trade and legal implications of Brexit remain uncertain and its impact may be more severe than expected given that the final terms upon which the United\n3\nKingdom will exit the EU are still not known and given the lack of comparable precedent. As a result, there can be no assurance that the changes the Group has made to the structure of its business operations in Europe will be sufficient to address the financial, trade and legal implications of Brexit, and the Group is subject to the risk that further changes may be required as a result of the final terms of Brexit.\nAustralian political conditions have progressively shifted over recent years. Shorter tenures for Prime Ministers appear to have become more common, and the focus on the societal impacts of the financial sector, and other business sectors as well, has sharpened. The banking tax and the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry (the “Royal Commission”) have been initiated in this environment. The Royal Commission process itself appears to have exacerbated this shift, suggesting a sustained period of focus on the financial sector in Australia.\nPolitical and economic uncertainty has in the past led to declines in market liquidity and activity levels, volatile market conditions, a contraction of available credit, lower or negative interest rates, weaker economic growth and reduced business confidence, each of which may adversely affect the Group’s Position. These conditions may also adversely affect the Group’s ability to raise medium or long-term funding in the international capital markets.\nGeopolitical instability, including potential or actual conflict, occurring around the world, such as the ongoing unrest and conflicts in Ukraine, North Korea, Hong Kong, Syria, Egypt, Afghanistan, Iraq, Nicaragua and elsewhere, as well as the current high threat of terrorist activities, may also adversely affect global financial markets, general business and economic conditions and consequently, the Group’s ability to continue operating or trading in an affected country or region that in turn may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\nShould difficult economic conditions in the Group’s markets eventuate, asset values in the housing, commercial or rural property markets could decline, unemployment could rise and corporate and personal incomes could suffer. Deterioration in global markets, including equity, property, currency and other asset markets, may impact the Group’s customers and the security the Group holds against loans and other credit exposures, which may impact the Group’s ability to recover loans and other credit exposures.\nThe Group’s financial performance may also be adversely affected if the Group is unable to adapt cost structures, products, pricing or activities in response to a drop in demand or lower than expected revenues. Similarly, higher than expected costs (including credit and funding costs) could be incurred because of adverse changes in the economy, general business conditions or the operating environment in the countries or regions in which the Group or its customers or counterparties operate.\nAll or any of the negative political, business or economic conditions described above may cause a reduction in demand for the Group’s products and services and/or an increase in loan and other credit defaults and bad debts, which may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\n2. Competition in the markets in which the Group operates may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nThe markets in which the Group operates are highly competitive and could become even more so. Many factors contribute to competition risk including mergers, acquisitions, divestments, joint ventures and alliances, changes in customers’ needs, preferences and behaviours, entry of new participants, development of new distribution and service methods and technologies, increased diversification of products by competitors and changes in regulation such as the rules governing the operations of banks and non-bank competitors. Other examples are:\n\n\nentities that the Group competes with, including those outside of Australia and New Zealand, could be subject to different levels of regulation and regulatory activity. This could allow them to offer more competitive products and services, including because those different levels give them a lower cost base and/or the ability to attract employees that the Group would otherwise seek to employ; digital technologies and business models are changing customer behaviour and the\n4\n\n\ncompetitive environment and emerging competitors are increasingly utilising new technologies and seeking to disrupt existing business models in the financial services sector; existing companies from outside of the traditional financial services sector may seek to directly compete with the Group by offering products and services traditionally provided by banks, including by obtaining banking licences and/or by partnering with existing providers; consumers and businesses may choose to transact using, or to invest in, new forms of currency (such as cryptocurrencies) in relation to which the Group may choose not to provide financial services; and\nOpen Banking (as described below) may lead to increased competition (see risk factor 15 “Regulatory changes or a failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies may adversely affect the Group’s Position”).\nIncreasing competition for customers could also potentially lead to a compression in the Group’s net interest margins or increased advertising and related expenses to attract and retain customers.\nThe Group competes with banks and other financial services firms for deposits to fund a significant portion of its balance sheet. Increased competition for deposits may increase the Group’s cost of funding. If the Group is not able to successfully compete for deposits, the Group would be forced to rely more heavily on other, less stable or more expensive forms of funding, or to reduce lending. This may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\nThe impact on the Group of an increase in competitive market conditions or a technological change that puts the Group’s business platforms at a competitive disadvantage, especially in the Group’s main markets and products, could lead to a material reduction in the Group’s market share, customers and margins and adversely affect the Group’s Position.\n3. Weakening of the real estate markets in Australia, New Zealand or other markets where the Group does business may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nResidential and commercial property lending, together with real estate development and investment property finance, constitute important businesses of the Group. Major sub- segments within the Group's lending portfolio include:\n•\nresidential housing loans (owner occupier and investment); and commercial real estate loans.\nSince 2009, the world’s major central banks have embarked upon unprecedented monetary policy stimulus. The resulting weight of funds searching for yield continues to be a significant driver underlying property markets in the Group’s core property jurisdictions (Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong). However, although values for completed tenanted properties and residential house prices, particularly in metro east coast Australian and New Zealand markets, rose steadily until 2018, the fall in Australian house prices in 2018 was the largest since the global financial crisis. Across Australia, house prices are approximately 7% below their late 2017 peak, although they are still almost 30% higher as at April 2019 since the start of 20131.\nA continued weakening of real estate markets in Australia, New Zealand, and other markets where the Group does business could impact the Group in a number of ways. These include: declining asset prices could impact customers, counterparties and the value of security (including residential and commercial property) the Group holds against these loans, impacting the Group’s ability to recover amounts owing if customers or counterparties were to default. declining demand for the Group’s residential lending products due to buyer concerns about decreases in values or concerns about rising interest rates that may make the Group’s lending products less attractive to potential homeowners and investors; and • A material decline in residential housing prices may also cause losses in the Group’s residential development portfolio if customers who are pre- committed to purchase\n\n\n1 Source: RBA Financial Stability Review, April 2019\n5\nthese dwellings are unable or unwilling to complete their contracts and the Group is forced to re-sell these dwellings at a loss.\nThe Group's portfolio of commercial property loans may be particularly susceptible to asset price deflation, tenancy risk and delivery risk, which may result in higher credit losses, refinance risk and deteriorating security values. A significant decrease in commercial property valuations or a significant slowdown in the commercial real estate markets in the Relevant Jurisdictions could result in a decrease in new lending opportunities or lower recovery rates that may in turn materially and adversely impact the Group’s Position.\n4. Market risk events may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nMarket risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit spreads, or from fluctuations in bond, commodity or equity prices. For purposes of financial risk management, the Group differentiates between traded and non- traded market risks. Traded market risks principally arise from the Group’s trading operations in interest rates, foreign exchange, commodities and securities. The non-traded market risk is predominantly interest rate risk in the banking book. Other non-traded market risks include transactional and structural foreign exchange risk arising from capital investments in offshore operations and non-traded equity risk. Losses arising from the occurrence of such market risk events may adversely affect the Group's Position.\n5. Changes in exchange rates may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nAs the Group conducts business in several different currencies, its businesses may be affected by a change in currency exchange rates. Additionally, as the Group’s annual and interim reports are prepared and stated in Australian dollars, any appreciation in the Australian dollar against other currencies in which the Group earns revenues (particularly the New Zealand dollar and U.S. dollar) may adversely affect the Group’s reported earnings.\nWhile the Group has put in place hedges to partially mitigate the impact of currency changes, there can be no assurance that the Group’s hedges will be sufficient or effective, and any further appreciation may have an adverse impact upon the Group’s Position.\n6. The regulation, reform and replacement of benchmark rates could have adverse consequences on the Group’s securities issuances and its capital markets and investment activities\nInterest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” including those in widespread and long-standing use, have been the subject of ongoing international regulatory scrutiny, and initiatives and proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented or are under consideration. These reforms may cause benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be fully anticipated.\nAny of the benchmark reforms which have been proposed or implemented, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could also increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of benchmarks and complying with regulations or requirements relating to benchmarks. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to certain benchmarks, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain benchmarks or lead to the disappearance of certain benchmarks. Any of these developments, and any future initiatives to regulate, reform or change the administration of benchmarks, could result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of and market for loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark, including those issued, funded or held by the Group.\nVarious regulators, industry bodies and other market participants globally are engaged in initiatives to develop, introduce and encourage the use of alternative rates to replace certain benchmarks. There is no assurance that these new rates will be accepted or widely used by market participants, or that the characteristics of any of these new rates will be similar to, or produce the economic equivalent of, the benchmarks that they seek to replace. If a particular\n6\nbenchmark were to be discontinued and an alternative rate has not been successfully introduced to replace that benchmark, this could result in widespread dislocation in the financial markets, engender volatility in the pricing of securities, derivatives and other instruments, and suppress capital markets activities, all of which could have adverse effects on the Group’s Position. In addition, the transition of a particular benchmark to a replacement rate could affect hedge accounting relationships between financial instruments linked to that benchmark and any related derivatives, which could adversely affect the Group’s Position.\nOn 27 July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In a subsequent announcement on 12 July 2018, the FCA emphasized the need for market participants to transition away from LIBOR before the end of 2021. Such announcements indicate that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021, and there is a substantial risk that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified by 2021. Vast amounts of loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments are linked to the LIBOR benchmark, and any failure by market participants and regulators to successfully introduce benchmark rates to replace LIBOR and implement effective transitional arrangements to address the discontinuation of LIBOR could result in disruption in the financial markets, suppress capital markets activities and give rise to litigation claims, all of which could have a negative impact on the Group’s position and on LIBOR-linked securities or other instruments which are issued, funded or held by the Group.\n7. Acquisitions and/or divestments may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nThe Group regularly examines a range of corporate opportunities, including acquisitions and divestments, with a view to determining whether those opportunities will enhance the Group’s strategic position and financial performance.\nDivestments that the Group has previously announced but not yet completed include OnePath Pensions and Investments in Australia which remains subject to regulatory approvals.\nIntegration (or separation) of an acquired (or divested) business can be complex and costly, sometimes including combining (or separating) relevant accounting and data processing systems, and management controls, as well as managing relevant relationships with employees, customers, regulators, counterparties, suppliers and other business partners. Integration (or separation) efforts could create inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, as well as diverting management attention and resources. There is also the risk of counterparties making claims in respect of completed or uncompleted transactions against the Group that could adversely affect the Group’s Position. There can also be no assurance that any acquisition (or divestment) would have the anticipated positive results around cost or cost savings, time to integrate and overall performance. All or any of these factors could adversely affect the Group’s ability to conduct its business successfully and impact the Group’s operations or results. Additionally, there can be no assurance that employees, customers, counterparties, suppliers and other business partners of newly acquired (or retained) businesses will remain post-acquisition (or post-divestment). Further, there is a risk that completion of an agreed transaction may not occur whether in the form originally agreed between the parties or at all, including due to failure of the counterparty to satisfy its completion conditions or because other completion conditions such as obtaining relevant regulatory or other approvals are not satisfied. Should any of these integration or separation risks occur, this could adversely affect the Group’s Position.\n8. Sovereign risk events may destabilise global financial markets and may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nSovereign risk is the risk that governments will default on their debt obligations, be unable to refinance their debts as and when they fall due or nationalise parts of their economy. Sovereign risk remains in many economies, including the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Should one sovereign default, there could be a cascading effect to other markets and countries, the consequences of which, while difficult to predict, may be similar to or worse than those experienced during the global financial crisis and subsequent sovereign debt crises.\n7\nSuch events could destabilise global financial markets and adversely affect the Group’s Position.\nRisks related to the Issuer's financial situation\n9. Credit risk may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nAs a financial institution, the Group is exposed to the risks associated with extending credit to other parties, including incurring credit-related losses that can occur as a result of a counterparty being unable or unwilling to honour its contractual obligations. Credit losses can and have resulted in financial services organisations realising significant losses and in some cases failing altogether.\nThe risk of credit-related losses may be increased by a number of factors, including deterioration in the financial condition of the economies in which the Group or its customers or counterparties operate, a sustained high level of unemployment in the markets in which the Group or its customers or counterparties operate, more expensive imports into Australia and New Zealand due to the reduced strength of the Australian and New Zealand dollars relative to other currencies, a deterioration of the financial condition of the Group’s customers or counterparties, a reduction in the value of assets the Group holds as collateral, and a reduction in the market value of the counterparty instruments and obligations it holds.\nLess favourable business or economic conditions, whether generally or in a specific industry sector or geographic region, as well as the occurrence of events such as natural disasters, could cause customers or counterparties to fail to meet their obligations in accordance with agreed terms.\nFor example, the Group’s customers and counterparties in or with exposure to:\n\n\n\nincreased geopolitical risk including the continuation or escalation of the trade conflict between the United States and China may impact the outlook for commodity prices due to a growing possibility of declining global growth. A further or sustained slowdown in global economic growth or a decline in commodity prices could depress the volume and price of exports, such as dairy products produced in Australia and New Zealand, with negative flow-on effects for those industries closely tied to the export sector; the Australian natural resources sector, which is particularly exposed to any prolonged slowdown in the Chinese economy and could be materially and adversely impacted by a decline in natural resource prices; and segments reliant on consumer discretionary spend in Australia that are exposed to a slowdown in spending levels arising from the impact of a combination of a slowing housing market, low wage growth and high household debt. Impacted segments may include specialty retail, department stores and discretionary retail leisure travel.\nThe Group is also subject to the risk that its rights against third parties may not be enforceable in certain circumstances, which may result in credit losses. Should material credit losses occur to the Group’s credit exposures, this may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\nCredit risk may also arise from certain derivative, clearing and settlement contracts the Group enters into, and from the Group’s dealings with, and holdings of, debt securities issued by other banks, financial institutions, companies, governments and government bodies where the financial conditions of such entities are affected by economic conditions in global financial markets.\nIn addition, in assessing whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and/or counterparties, the Group relies on information provided by or on behalf of customers and/or counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. The Group may also rely on representations of customers and independent consultants as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. The Group’s financial performance could be negatively impacted to the extent that it relies on information that is inaccurate or materially misleading.\nThe Group holds provisions for credit impairment that are determined based on current information and subjective and complex judgements of the impairment within the Group’s\n8\nlending portfolio. If the information upon which the assessment is made proves to be inaccurate or if the Group fails to analyse the information correctly, the provisions made for credit impairment may be insufficient, which may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\n10. Challenges in managing the Group’s capital base could give rise to greater volatility in capital ratios, which may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nThe Group’s capital base is critical to the management of its businesses and access to funding. Prudential regulators of the Group include, but are not limited to, APRA, RBNZ and various regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom and the countries in the Asia Pacific region. The Group is required by its primary regulator, APRA (and the RBNZ for ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited (\"ANZ New Zealand\" and, together with its subsidiaries the (\"ANZ New Zealand Group\"), to maintain adequate regulatory capital.\nUnder current regulatory requirements, risk-weighted assets and expected loan losses increase as counterparty’s risk grade worsens. These regulatory capital requirements are likely to compound the impact of any reduction in capital resulting from lower profits in times of stress. As a result, greater volatility in capital ratios may arise and may require the Group to raise additional capital. There can be no certainty that any additional capital required would be available or could be raised on reasonable terms.\nThe Group’s capital ratios may be affected by a number of factors, such as (i) lower earnings (including lower dividends from its deconsolidated subsidiaries such as those in the insurance and funds management businesses as well as from its investment in associates), (ii) increased asset growth, (iii) changes in the value of the Australian dollar against other currencies in which the Group operates (particularly the New Zealand dollar and U.S. dollar) that impact risk weighted assets or the foreign currency translation reserve (iv) changes in business strategy (including acquisitions, divestments and investments or an increase in capital intensive businesses), and (v) changes in regulatory requirements.\nAPRA and the RBNZ have implemented prudential standards to accommodate Basel 3. Certain other regulators have either implemented or are in the process of implementing regulations, including Basel 3, that seek to strengthen, among other things, the liquidity and capital requirements of banks, funds management entities and insurance entities, though there can be no assurance that these regulations have had or will have their intended effect. These regulations, together with any risks arising from any regulatory changes (including those arising from APRA’s response to the remaining Financial System Inquiry (“FSI”) recommendations, further changes from APRA’s “unquestionably strong” requirements, the requirements of the BCBS, or the RBNZ’s review of capital requirements), are described in risk factor 15 \"Regulatory changes or a failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies may adversely affect the Group’s Position\".\nAny inability of the Group to maintain its regulatory capital may have a material adverse effect on the Group's Position.\n11. The Group’s credit ratings could change and adversely affect the Group’s ability to raise capital and wholesale funding and constrain the volume of new lending, which may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nThe Group’s credit ratings have a significant impact on both its access to, and cost of, capital and wholesale funding. They may also be important to customers or counterparties when evaluating the Group’s products and services. Credit ratings and rating outlooks may be withdrawn, qualified, revised or suspended by credit rating agencies at any time. The methodologies used by ratings agencies to determine credit ratings and rating outlooks may be revised in response to legal or regulatory changes, market developments or for any other reason.\nThe Group’s credit ratings or rating outlooks could be affected by a change in the credit rating of the Commonwealth of Australia or New Zealand, the occurrence of one or more of the other risks identified in this document, a change in the ratings methodologies or by other events. As a result, downgrades in the Group’s credit ratings could occur that do not reflect changes in the general economic conditions or the Group's financial condition.\n9\nIn addition, the ratings of individual securities (including, but not limited to, certain Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital securities and covered bonds) issued by the Group (and other banks globally) could be impacted from time to time by changes in the regulatory requirements for those instruments as well as the ratings methodologies used by rating agencies.\nAny future downgrade or potential downgrade to the Group’s credit ratings or rating outlooks may reduce access to capital and wholesale debt markets and could lead to an increase in funding costs, which could constrain the volume of new lending and affect the willingness of counterparties to transact with the Group and may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\nCredit ratings are not a recommendation by the relevant rating agency to invest in securities offered by the Group.\n12. Liquidity and funding risk events may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nLiquidity and funding risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due (including repaying depositors or maturing wholesale debt) or that the Group has insufficient capacity to fund increases in assets. Liquidity and funding risk is inherent in all banking operations due to the timing mismatch between cash inflows and cash outflows. Reduced liquidity could lead to an increase in the cost of the Group’s borrowings and constrain the volume of new lending that may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\nDeterioration in market conditions and/or investor confidence in the Group may materially impact the Group’s ability to replace maturing liabilities and access funding (in a timely and cost effective manner), which may adversely impact the Group’s Position.\nThe Group raises funding from a variety of sources, including customer deposits and wholesale funding domestically and in offshore markets to meet its funding requirements and to maintain or grow its business generally. Developments in major markets can adversely affect liquidity in global capital markets. For example, in times of liquidity stress, if there is damage to market confidence in the Group or if funding inside or outside of domestic markets is not available or constrained, the Group’s ability to access sources of funding and liquidity may be constrained and it will be exposed to liquidity and funding risk. In such cases, the Group may be forced to seek alternative funding. The availability of such alternative funding, and the terms on which it may be available, will depend on a variety of factors, including prevailing market conditions and the Group’s credit ratings at that time (which are strongly influenced by Australia’s credit rating). Even if available, the cost of these funding alternatives may be more expensive or on unfavourable terms that may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\n13. Changes in the valuation of some of the Group’s assets and liabilities may adversely affect the Group’s earnings and/or equity, and therefore its financial position\nThe Group applies accounting standards that require that various financial instruments, including derivative instruments, assets and liabilities classified as fair value through other comprehensive income, and certain other assets and liabilities (as per Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year ended 30 September 2019 as set out in the Group’s 2019 Annual Report (“2019 Financial Statements”)) are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in earnings or equity.\nGenerally, in order to establish the fair value of these instruments, the Group relies on quoted market prices or, where the market for a financial instrument is not sufficiently active, fair values are based on present value estimates or other valuation techniques that incorporate the impact of factors that would influence the fair value as determined by a market participant. The fair value of these instruments is impacted by changes in market prices or valuation inputs that may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s earnings and/or equity.\nIn addition, the Group may be exposed to a reduction in the value of non-lending related assets as a result of impairments that are recognised in earnings. The Group is required to\n10\nassess the recoverability of goodwill balances at least annually and other non-lending related assets including premises and equipment, investment in associates, capitalised software and other intangible assets (including acquired portfolio of insurance and investment businesses and deferred acquisition costs) where there are indicators of impairment.\nFor the purpose of assessing the recoverability of the goodwill balances, the Group uses either a discounted cash flow or a multiple of earnings calculation. Changes in the assumptions upon which the calculation is based, together with expected changes in future cash flows, may materially impact this assessment, resulting in the potential write-off of a part or all of the goodwill balances.\nIn respect of other non-lending related assets, in the event that an asset is no longer in use, or that the cash flows generated by the asset do not support the carrying value, impairment charges may be recorded. This, in conjunction with the other potential changes above, could impact the Group’s Position.\n14. Changes to accounting policies may adversely affect the Group’s financial position\nThe accounting policies that the Group applies are fundamental to how it records and reports its financial position and results of operations. Management must exercise judgement in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies so that they not only comply with the applicable accounting standards or interpretations but that they also reflect the most appropriate manner in which to record and report on the Group’s financial position and results of operations. However, these accounting policies may be applied inaccurately, resulting in a misstatement of the Group’s financial position. In addition, the application of new or revised accounting standards or interpretations may adversely affect the Group’s financial position. The impact of new accounting standards effective for the first time in the Group’s 2019 financial year is outlined in Note 1 and Note 35 of the 2019 Financial Statements.\nIn some cases, management must select an accounting policy from two or more alternatives, any of which would comply with the relevant accounting standard or interpretation to the Group and be reasonable under the circumstances, yet might result in reporting materially different outcomes than would have been reported under the alternative.\nLegal and regulatory risk\n15. Regulatory changes or a failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nThe Group’s businesses and operations are highly regulated. The Group is subject to a substantial number of laws, regulations and policies, including industry self-regulation, in the Relevant Jurisdictions in which it carries on business or obtains funding and is supervised by a number of different authorities in each of these jurisdictions.\nThe resources allocated to the regulation and supervision of financial services groups, such as the Group, and the enforcement of laws against them, have increased substantially in recent years, particularly in Australia and New Zealand. As a result, the regulation and supervision of financial services groups has become increasingly extensive and complex across the Relevant Jurisdictions. Such regulation and supervision continue to evolve.\nCommunity concern with misconduct in the financial services industry in Australia, including the Group, has led to a substantial increase in the number of laws, regulations, enforcement and other legal actions and policies applied to the financial services industry, each of which could adversely affect the Group’s Position. In particular, in Australia:\nRoyal Commission: The Royal Commission made 76 recommendations concerning law reform, self-regulatory standards and the operations of ASIC and APRA. Depending on how the recommendations are implemented by the Australian Government and followed by regulatory agencies, they could result in additional costs and may lead to further exposures, including exposures associated with further regulator activity or potential customer exposures such as class actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities. The recommendations may also lead to adjustments in the 11\ncompetitive environment of the Group. The outcomes and total costs associated with these possible exposures and changes remain uncertain and their impact may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\nCompetition Laws, Regulations and Inquiries: There is a strong focus on the regulation\n\nof competition in the financial services sector. The Productivity Commission, an independent research and advisory body to the Australian Government, undertook an inquiry into competition in Australia’s financial system and released its report in August 2018. Policy and law reforms in response to the final report may adversely affect the Group's Position. In May 2017, the Federal Treasurer directed the ACCC to conduct an inquiry into prices charged or proposed to be charged by ADIs affected by the Major Bank Levy (as defined below) in relation to residential mortgage products. A final report was published in December 2018. Findings in the report may lead to competition related policy changes or increased regulatory scrutiny. In October 2019, the Australian Government directed the ACCC to immediately commence an inquiry into home loan pricing of the major Australian banks, which includes the Group. In October 2018, the ACCC commenced an inquiry into foreign currency conversion services. The ACCC examined price competition amongst suppliers of foreign currency conversion services to consider whether there are impediments to effective competition. The ACCC provided its final report to the Federal Treasurer in September 2019. In July 2019, the ACCC released its final report of its Digital Platforms Inquiry. This report recommended reforms to privacy and certain consumer protections. The Australian Government is consulting on these recommendations. A draft report from the ACCC on customer loyalty schemes released in September 2019 has proposed some overlapping reforms. Legislative, regulatory or supervisory changes in response to these recommendations could adversely affect the Group's Position.\n\nProduct Laws, Regulations and Inquiries. There is a strong focus on the suitability of products offered by financial services providers, including the Group. Regulatory policy development and monitoring of responsible consumer lending has increased significantly, and continues to drive the review of, and changes to, business practices. If any additional changes in law, regulation or policy are implemented, as a result of the development and monitoring of responsible consumer lending, such changes may impact the manner in which the Group provides consumer lending services in the future that may adversely affect the Group’s operations in this area and consequently, the Group’s Position. For example, ASIC is currently reviewing its regulatory guidance on responsible lending laws. In addition, the Australian Government passed legislation in 2019 to enhance the regulation of the design and distribution of financial and credit products in Australia and to provide ASIC with product intervention powers where it perceives a risk of significant consumer detriment, which have already been used by ASIC. There are significant penalties for non-compliance and such legislation could impact the Group’s ability to issue and market financial products in the future. Increased compliance costs resulting from financial product distribution requirements may adversely impact the Group’s Position.\n\nIncreasing Corporate Penalties and Funding for Regulators. There are increased penalties for breaches of laws in Australia, as well as increased funding for regulators to prosecute breaches. The Australian Consumer Law was amended to increase penalties for breaches of consumer law from September 2018. The increased penalties relate to unconscionable conduct, false or misleading representations about goods or services, unfair practices, the safety of consumer goods and product-related services and information standards. The Australian Government announced in March 2019 that ASIC would be provided with more than A$400 million and APRA with more than A$150 million in additional funding to support enforcement, regulation and supervision. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Strengthening Corporate and Financial Sector Penalties) Act 2019 significantly increased the sanctions applicable to the contravention of a range of corporate and financial sector obligations. The imposition of such penalties on the Group may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\nSenior Executive Accountability Laws and Regulations. There are increasing penalties and specialised rules applicable to senior executives in the banking sector. The Banking Executive Accountability Regime (“BEAR”) was introduced as a new responsibility and\n12\naccountability framework for the directors and most senior executives in ADI groups. The Australian Government has indicated that the BEAR will be extended and modified following the Royal Commission. Potential risks to the Group from the BEAR legislation include the risk of penalties and the risk to the Group’s ability to attract and retain high-quality directors and senior executives.\nOther Government or regulatory interventions in the financial sector. There remain ongoing Australian Government and regulator led inquiries and interventions into Australia’s banks. These inquiries are wide ranging and could lead to legislative or regulatory changes or measures that may adversely affect the Group’s Position. The Commonwealth Parliament has held and will hold public hearings to review the four major banks, including the Group, during 2019. ASIC held public hearings on responsible lending in August 2019. The Australian Government imposed a levy on liabilities for certain large banks, including the Group, with effect from July 2017 (“Major Bank Levy”). There is a risk that the Australian Government could increase the Major Bank Levy or introduce new levies on banks. Australian State and Territory governments may introduce similar levies that may adversely affect the Group’s Position. ASIC has also implemented a new and more intensive supervisory approach by placing ASIC staff onsite in major financial institutions to closely monitor governance and compliance with laws. Scrutiny of banks also increased following the commencement by the AUSTRAC of civil penalty proceedings in 2017 against another major Australian bank relating to alleged past and ongoing contraventions of the Anti- Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Commonwealth).\n\nIndustry self-regulation. There is continued focus on industry best practice guidance and standards impacting retail and small business banking. Changes to self-regulatory instruments, including industry codes and practice guidelines, is requiring considerable Group resources to implement and monitor compliance. A new Australian Banking Code came into effect from July 2019, with further changes to certain retail and small business products and processes being introduced by March 2020 to give effect to Royal Commission recommendations. Industry guidance on working with vulnerable customers is also evolving. Such changes may impact the products that the Group is able to offer to its customers and the operational costs associated with delivery, which may adversely impact the Group’s Position.\nThere are also other emerging regulatory developments and challenges, which include:\n\nPrudential Developments: Developments in prudential regulation continue to impact the Group in a material way. Given the number of items that are currently open for consultation with APRA and the RBNZ, the potential impacts on the Group remain uncertain. Further changes to APRA’s prudential standards could increase the level of regulatory capital that the Group is required to maintain, restrict the Group’s flexibility, require it to incur substantial costs and/or impact the profitability of one or more business lines any of which may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\no\nIn October 2019, APRA released a discussion paper on draft revisions to the prudential standard APS111 “Capital Adequacy: Measurement of Capital” (“APS111”) for consultation. The most material change from APRA’s proposal is in relation to the treatment of capital investments for each banking and insurance subsidiary at Level 1, with the tangible component of the investment changing from a 400% risk weighting to:\no 250% risk weighting up to an amount equal to 10% of ANZBGL’s net Level\n1 Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital; and\no the remainder of the investment will be treated as a CET1 capital\ndeduction.\nANZBGL is reviewing the implications for its current investments. The net impact on the Group is unclear and will depend upon a number of factors including the capitalisation of the affected subsidiaries at the time of implementation, the final form of the prudential standard, as well as the effect of management actions being pursued that have the potential to materially offset the impact of these proposals. Based on ANZBGL’s current investment in its affected subsidiaries and in the absence of any offsetting management actions, the above proposals imply\n13\na reduction in ANZBGL’s Level 1 CET1 capital ratio of up to approximately A$2.5 billion (~75 basis points). However, ANZBGL believes that this outcome is unlikely and, post implementation of management actions, the net capital impact could be minimal. There is no impact on the Group’s Level 2 CET1 capital ratio arising from these proposed changes, which are proposed to be implemented from 1 January 2021.\no\nIn August 2019, APRA announced that it will amend APS222 “Associations with Related Parties” to reduce the limits for Australian ADIs’ individual entity exposure to related ADIs (or overseas equivalents) from 50% of Level 1 Total capital to 25% of Level 1 Tier 1 capital, and aggregate exposures from 150% of Level 1 Total capital to 75% of Level 1 Tier 1 capital. As exposures are measured net of capital deductions, the proposed changes to APRA’s capital regulations (contained in APS111) will affect the measurement of ADI exposures. The changes are proposed to be implemented from 1 January 2021.\no\nIn July 2019, APRA announced its decision on loss-absorbing capacity pursuant to which it will require Australian domestic systemically important banks (“D- SIBs”), including ANZBGL, to increase their Total Capital by 3% of risk-weighted assets by January 2024. Based on the Group’s capital position as at 30 September 2019, this represents an incremental increase in the total capital requirement of approximately A$12 billion, with an equivalent decrease in other senior funding. APRA has stated that it anticipates that D-SIBs would satisfy the requirement predominantly with additional Tier 2 capital. APRA is considering, over the next four years, alternative methods for raising additional 1% and 2% of risk weighted assets.\no\nImplementation of APRA’s revisions to the capital framework for ADIs, resulting from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”) Basel 3 capital reforms and the recommendations of the FSI, will continue over the coming years. APRA is consulting on an ongoing basis on its intention to strengthen banking system resilience by establishing “unquestionably strong” capital ratios. APRA indicated that in the case of the four major Australian D-SIBs, this equated to a benchmark Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio, under the current capital adequacy framework, of at least 10.5% and this benchmark should be met by 1 January 2020. Additionally, APRA is currently consulting on changes to ADIs risk-weighting framework and other capital requirements with final standards expected to be released in 2020 for implementation by the Group in 2022. APRA has announced that it does not expect that the changes to the risk weights will necessitate further increases in capital for ADIs, although this could vary by ADI depending on the final requirements.\no\nIn December 2018, the RBNZ released a consultation paper relating to possible additional RBNZ capital requirements in relation to the Group’s New Zealand assets. The overall impact on the Group depends on a number of factors, which include the outcome of the consultation, ANZ New Zealand’s balance sheet at the time of implementation and the outcome of other regulatory reviews that are currently underway.\nShareholder interventions. Under Australia’s “2 strikes” rule applicable to public companies listed on ASX, such as the Group, two successive votes of 25% or more against the adoption of the company’s remuneration report would require the company to put an ordinary resolution to shareholders to determine whether to hold a “spill meeting” where all non-executive Directors who approved the most recent remuneration report would need to stand for re-election by shareholders (by ordinary resolution). At the 2018 Annual General Meeting, there were sufficient votes against the adoption of the report for the Group to receive its “first strike” under the “2 strikes” rule. A second strike may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\nOpen Banking Laws. Open Banking is part of a new consumer data right in Australia that was made law in August 2019. The law can give consumers (both individuals and businesses) an entitlement to access, and have transferred to accredited third parties, certain designated data sets that relate to them. The ACCC has proposed that the major Australian banks (including the Group) would need to share consumer data about credit and debit cards, deposit accounts and transaction accounts from February 2020.\n14\nIn July 2020, consumer data for mortgage accounts will need to be made available. Consumer data concerning certain other products (for example, personal and business loans and certain other accounts) will need to be made available from February 2021. There are also requirements to share data relating to products. The Group commenced sharing product data voluntarily in July 2019. Open Banking may lead to increased competition that may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\nNew Zealand Developments. There have been a series of regulatory releases from New Zealand regulatory authorities that have proposed significant regulatory changes for New Zealand financial institutions. These changes include, among other things: RBNZ’s review of capital requirements, prudential credit controls, revised outsourcing and mortgage bond collateral standards review; the Financial Markets Authority’s (“FMA”) and the RBNZ’s conduct and culture review; the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s proposed conduct regulations for financial institutions, the FMA’s review of sales incentives structures in the New Zealand banking industry; the enactment of the Financial Services Legislation Amendment Act 2019 and replacement of the Financial Advisers Act 2008; the New Zealand Government review of the Reserve Bank Act, and proposed amendments to the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003. Such changes may adversely affect the ANZ New Zealand Group, potentially impacting its corporate structures, businesses, strategies, capital, liquidity, funding and profitability, cost structures, and the cost and access to credit for its customers and the wider economy. This in turn may adversely affect the Group's Position.\nOther Offshore Developments. There have been a series of other regulatory developments in Relevant Jurisdictions other than Australia and New Zealand. These include changes to financial regulations in the United States (including legislative changes to the Dodd-Frank Act and potential revision to its Volcker Rule), changes to senior executive accountability in Singapore, Hong Kong, and the UK, changes to English and European law in connection with Brexit, introduction of greater data protection regulations in Europe, implementation of further phases of the initial margin requirements for uncleared OTC derivatives in a number of the Relevant Jurisdictions and the requirement that banks prepare for the reform of EURIBOR and SIBOR, and the discontinuation of LIBOR and other such interbank offered rates by transitioning to risk free rates.\nA failure by the Group to comply with laws, regulations or policies in any Relevant Jurisdiction could result in regulatory investigations, legal or regulatory sanctions, financial or reputational loss, litigation, fines, penalties, restrictions on the Group’s ability to do business, revocation, suspension or variation of conditions of relevant regulatory licences or other enforcement or administrative action or agreements (such as enforceable undertakings) that may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\nSuch failures may also result in the Group being exposed to the risk of litigation brought by third parties (including through class action proceedings). The outcome of any litigation (including class action proceedings) may result in the payment of compensation to third parties and/or further remediation activities. For information in relation to the Group’s litigation and contingent liabilities, see risk factor 16 “Litigation and contingent liabilities may adversely affect the Group’s Position” and Note 33 of the 2019 Financial Statements.\n16. Litigation and contingent liabilities may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nFrom time to time, the Group may be subject to material litigation, regulatory actions, legal or arbitration proceedings and other contingent liabilities that may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\nThe Group had contingent liabilities as at 30 September 2019 in respect of the matters outlined in Note 33 of the 2019 Financial Statements.\nNote 33 includes, among other things, descriptions of:\n• •\nregulatory and customer exposures; bank fees litigation and periodical payment remediation and ASIC action; benchmark/rate actions;\n15\n• • •\ncapital raising actions; franchisee litigation; the Royal Commission; and security recovery actions.\nIn recent years there has been an increase in the number of matters on which the Group engages with its regulators. There have also been significant increases in the nature and scale of regulatory investigations and reviews, civil and criminal enforcement actions (whether by court action or otherwise), formal and informal inquiries, regulatory supervisory activities and the quantum of fines issued by regulators, particularly against financial institutions both in Australia and globally. The Group has received various notices and requests for information from its regulators as part of both industry-wide and Group-specific reviews and has also made disclosures to its regulators at its own instigation. The nature of these interactions can be wide ranging and, for example, currently include a range of matters including responsible lending practices, product suitability and distribution, interest and fees and the entitlement to charge them, customer remediation, wealth advice, insurance distribution, pricing, competition, conduct in financial markets and financial transactions, capital market transactions, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations, reporting and disclosure obligations and product disclosure documentation. There may be exposures to customers which are additional to any regulatory exposures. These could include class actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities. The outcomes and total costs associated with such reviews and possible exposures remain uncertain.\nThere is a risk that contingent liabilities may be larger than anticipated or that additional litigation, regulatory actions, legal or arbitration proceedings or other contingent liabilities may arise.\n17. Significant fines and sanctions in the event of breaches of law or regulation relating to anti-money laundering, counter-terrorism financing and sanctions may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nAnti-money laundering, counter-terrorism financing and sanctions compliance have been the subject of significant regulatory change and enforcement in recent years. The increasingly complicated environment in which the Group operates has heightened these operational and compliance risks. Furthermore, the increased transparency of the outcomes of compliance breaches by financial institutions both domestically and globally and the related fines and settlement sums mean that these risks continue to be an area of focus for the Group. Following the AUSTRAC civil penalty proceedings in 2017 against a major Australian bank relating to alleged past and ongoing contraventions of the AML Act, and the introduction of an infringement regime to allow more efficient regulatory action to be taken, there has been a change in regulatory stance toward further increased action against regulated entities in Australia. Similarly, the RBNZ has stated that its appetite for taking formal enforcement action for breaches of the New Zealand Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 has increased since September 2019. As a result of the enhanced scrutiny, Australian entities including the Group may incur additional costs associated with regulatory compliance that may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\nThe risk of non-compliance with anti-money laundering, counter-terrorism financing and sanction laws remains high given the scale and complexity of the Group and the lack of clarity around some mandatory reporting requirements. Emerging technologies, such as virtual currency issuers/exchangers and wallet providers as well as increasingly complex remittance arrangements via fintechs and other disruptors, may limit the Group’s ability to track the movement of funds. A failure to operate a robust programme to combat money laundering, bribery and terrorism financing or to ensure compliance with economic sanctions may have serious financial, legal and reputational consequences for the Group and its employees. Consequences can include fines, criminal and civil penalties, civil claims, reputational harm and limitations on doing business in certain jurisdictions. These consequences, individually or collectively may adversely affect the Group’s Position. The Group’s foreign operations may place the Group under increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities, and subject the Group to increased compliance costs.\n16\n18. Changes in monetary policies may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nCentral monetary authorities (including the RBA, the RBNZ, the United States Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the monetary authorities in the Asian jurisdictions in which the Group operates) set official interest rates or take other measures to affect the demand for money and credit in their relevant jurisdictions. In addition, in some jurisdictions, currency policy is also used to influence general business conditions and the demand for money and credit. These measures and policies can significantly affect the Group’s cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that the Group will earn on those loans and investments. These factors impact the Group’s net interest margin and can affect the value of financial instruments it holds, such as debt securities and hedging instruments. The measures and policies of the central monetary authorities can also affect the Group’s borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay loans.\nMany central monetary authorities have been actively reducing official interest rates, including the RBA, RBNZ and other authorities in jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Low or negative interest rates could put pressure on the Group’s interest margins and adversely affect the Group’s profitability and prospects.\nChanges in interest rates and monetary policy are difficult to predict and may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\n19. Increasing compliance costs, the risk of heightened penalties and ongoing regulatory scrutiny with respect to the significant obligations imposed by global tax reporting regimes (which are still evolving), may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nThere have been mandatory and substantial changes to, and increasing regulatory focus on, compliance by all global Financial Institutions (“FIs”), including the Group, with global tax transparency reporting regimes, including the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”), the OECD’s Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) and similar anti-tax avoidance regimes. Current regulatory focus also includes enforcement and implementation of detailed global tax reporting rules and frameworks to close down any circumvention of global tax reporting regimes and enforce any case of non-compliance.\nAs a global financial institution, the Group operates in a high volume and globally interlinked operating environment. In this context, the highly complex and rigid nature of the obligations under the various global tax reporting regimes present heightened operational and compliance risks for the Group. This may be coupled with the current increased regulatory scrutiny of global financial institutions (including the Group) and the increasing trend in compliance breaches by global financial institutions and related fines for non-compliance in general. Accordingly, compliance with global tax reporting regimes will continue to be a key area of focus for the Group.\nOngoing OECD peer review and other regulatory review activities are resulting in further extension and expansion of existing obligations together with increased focus on compliance with the CRS, pushing each country of adoption to ensure that its penalty regime is sufficiently adequate to deter non-compliance.\nUnder FATCA and other U.S. Treasury Regulations, the Group could be subject to:\n\n\na 30 percent withholding tax on certain amounts (including amounts payable to customers), and be required to provide certain information to upstream payers, as well as other adverse consequences, if the ongoing detailed obligations are not adequately met; and broader compliance issues, significant withholding exposure, competitive disadvantage and other operational impacts if the FATCA Intergovernmental Agreements between the United States and the applicable jurisdictions in which the Group operates cease to be in effect.\n17\nUnder the CRS, the Group:\n\nfaces challenges in developing countries where the Group has operations, such as the Pacific region. The local regulators in these countries are generally assisted by a ‘partner’ country which may introduce standards that can be challenging to implement;\nmust deal with considerable country specific variations in local law and regulatory implementation, with significant local regulatory penalties for non-collection or failed reporting in respect of prescribed customer information; and\n\nalong with other FIs, is under increasingly stringent regulatory scrutiny and measures as regulators turn their focus from initial establishment of the CRS to its effective implementation. This tightening of the regulatory focus can lead to significant negative experience for affected customers (including unilateral account blocking and closure), may adversely affect the Group’s Position and if not similarly implemented by other FIs, may present a significant competitive disadvantage.\nThe scale and complexity of the Group, like other FIs, means that the risk of inadvertent non- compliance with the FATCA, CRS and other tax reporting regimes is high. A failure to successfully operate the implemented processes could lead to legal, financial and reputational consequences for the Group and its employees. Consequences include fines, criminal and civil penalties, civil claims, reputational harm, competitive disadvantage, loss of business and constraints on doing business. These consequences, individually or collectively, may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\n20. Unexpected changes to the Group’s licence to operate in any jurisdiction may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nThe Group is licensed to operate in various countries, states and territories. Unexpected changes in the conditions of the licenses to operate by governments, administrations or regulatory agencies that prohibit or restrict the Group from trading in a manner that was previously permitted may adversely impact the Group’s Position.\nInternal control, operations and reputational risk\n21. Operational risk events may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nOperational risk is the risk of loss and/or non-compliance with laws resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. This definition includes legal risk, and the risk of reputational loss or damage arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and/or systems, but excludes strategic risk.\nOperational risk events include:\n• •\n\n• •\ninternal fraud (for example, involving employees or contractors); external fraud (for example, fraudulent loan applications or ATM skimming); employment practices, loss of key staff, inadequate workplace safety and failure to effectively implement employment policies; impacts on clients, products and business practices (for example, misuse of customer data or anti-competitive behaviour); business disruption (including systems failures); damage to physical assets; and execution, delivery and process management (for example, processing errors or data management failures).\nLoss from operational risk events may adversely affect the Group’s Position. Such losses can include fines, penalties, loss or theft of funds or assets, legal costs, customer compensation, loss of shareholder value, reputation loss, loss of life or injury to people, and loss of property and/or information.\n22. Reputational risk events as well as operational failures and regulatory compliance failures may give rise to reputational risk, which may adversely affect the Group’s Position\n18\nReputational risk may arise as a result of an external event or the Group’s own actions, which include operational and regulatory compliance failures. The occurrence of such events may adversely affect perceptions about the Group held by the public (including the Group’s customers), shareholders, investors, regulators or rating agencies. The impact of a risk event on the Group’s reputation may exceed any direct cost of the risk event itself and may adversely impact the Group’s Position.\nThe Group may incur reputational damage where one of its practices fails to meet community expectations. As these expectations may exceed the standard required in order to comply with applicable law, the Group may incur reputational damage even where it has met its legal obligations. A divergence between community expectations and the Group’s practices could arise in a number of ways, including in relation to its product and services disclosure practices, pricing policies and use of data. Further, the Group’s reputation may also be adversely affected by community perception of the broader financial services industry.\nAdditionally, certain operational and regulatory compliance failures may give rise to reputational risk. Such operational and regulatory compliance failures include, but are not limited to:\n• • •\nfailures related to fulfilment of identification obligations; failures related to new product development; failures related to ongoing product monitoring activities; failures related to suitability requirements when products are sold outside of the target market;\nmarket manipulation or anti-competitive behaviour; • • • • • •\nfailure to comply with disclosure obligations; inappropriate crisis management/response to a crisis event; inappropriate handling of customer complaints; inappropriate third party arrangements; privacy breaches; and unexpected risks (e.g. credit, market, operational or compliance).\nDamage to the Group’s reputation may have wide-ranging impacts, including adverse effects on the Group’s profitability, capacity and cost of sourcing funding, increased regulatory scrutiny and availability of new business opportunities. The Group’s ability to attract and retain customers could also be adversely affected if the Group’s reputation is damaged, which may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\n23. Conduct-related risk events or behaviours may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nThe Group defines conduct-related risk as the risk of loss or damage arising from the failure of the Group, its employees or agents to appropriately consider the interests of consumers, the integrity of the financial markets, and the expectations of the community in conducting the Group’s business activities.\nConduct-related risks can result from:\n•\n\n•\n•\nthe provision of unsuitable or inappropriate advice to customers; the representation of, or disclosure about, a product or service which is inaccurate, or does not provide adequate information about risks and benefits to customers; a failure to deliver product features and benefits in accordance with terms, disclosures, recommendations and/or advice; a failure to appropriately avoid or manage conflicts of interest; sales and/or promotion processes (including incentives and remuneration for staff engaged in promotion, sales and/or the provision of advice); the provision of credit, outside of the Group’s policies and standards; and trading activities in financial markets, outside of the Group’s policies and standards.\nThere has been an increasing regulatory and community focus on conduct-related risk globally and in particular, in Australia and New Zealand. For example, the Group is currently\n19\nundertaking a variety of customer remediation programs, of which some relate to conduct issues that have been identified from reviews to date and these reviews remain on-going. Conduct-related risk events may expose the Group to regulatory actions, restrictions or conditions on banking licences and/or reputational consequences that may adversely affect the Group's Position. Remediation programs may not be implemented appropriately or may lead to further remediation work being required, resulting in litigation, regulatory action and/or increasing cost to the Group, all of which may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\nFor further discussion of the increasing regulatory focus on conduct-related risk, see risk factor 15 “Regulatory changes or a failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies may adversely affect the Group’s Position” and risk factor 16 “Litigation and contingent liabilities may adversely affect the Group’s Position”.\n24. Disruption of information technology systems or failure to successfully implement new technology systems could significantly interrupt the Group’s business, which may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nThe Group’s day-to-day activities and its service offerings (including digital banking) are highly dependent on information technology systems. Therefore, there is a risk that disruption or unavailability of information technology systems, or the services the Group uses or is dependent upon, will result in the Group failing to meet customers’ banking requirements and/or failing to meet compliance obligations and regulators’ expectations.\nThreats to information technology systems are continuously evolving and cyber threats and the risk of attacks are increasing. The Group may not be able to anticipate or implement effective measures to prevent or minimise disruptions caused by cyber threats because the techniques used can be highly sophisticated and those perpetuating the attacks may be well- resourced.\nThe Group has an ongoing obligation to maintain information technology systems, to ensure currency and information security resiliency and to enhance business capabilities and digital banking services for the Group’s customers. The Group may not implement this effectively or execute this obligation efficiently, which could lead to increased costs, delays in complying with regulatory requirements, unstable or insecure systems or a decrease in the Group’s ability to service its customers, which may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\nIn addition, ANZ New Zealand relies on the Group to provide a number of information technology systems. A failure of the Group’s systems may directly affect ANZ New Zealand, which may in turn, adversely affect the Group's Position.\n25. Risks associated with information security including cyber-attacks, may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nInformation security means protecting information and technology systems from disruptions to confidentiality, integrity or availability. As a bank, the Group handles a considerable amount of personal and confidential information about its customers and its own internal operations, including in Australia, New Zealand, India, the United States, Europe, Singapore and China. This information is processed and stored on both internal and third party hosted environments, hence security controls need to be operated effectively by the Group and its third parties and related parties to ensure information is safeguarded.\nThe Group operates in multiple countries and the risks to its systems are inherently higher in certain countries where, for example, political threats or targeted cyber-attacks by terrorist or criminal organisations are greater.\nThe Group is conscious that cyber threats, such as advanced persistent threats, distributed denial of service, malware and ransomware, are continuously evolving, becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume. Any failure in the Group’s cybersecurity policies, procedures or controls, may result in significant financial losses, major business disruption, inability to deliver customer services, or loss of data or other sensitive information (including as a result of an outage) and may cause associated reputational damage. Any of these\n20\nfactors could increase costs (including costs relating to notification of, or compensation for customers), and may result in regulatory investigations or sanctions being imposed or may affect the Group’s ability to retain and attract customers, and thus may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\nEnvironmental, social and governance risks\n26. The Group’s risk management framework may fail to manage all existing risks appropriately or detect new and emerging risks fast enough, which could adversely affect the Group’s Position\nRisk management is an integral part of all of the Group’s activities and includes the identification and monitoring of the Group’s risk appetite and reporting on the Group’s risk exposure and effectiveness of identified controls. However, there can be no assurance that the Group’s risk management framework will be effective in all instances including in respect of existing risks, or new and emerging risks that the Group has not anticipated or identified, and for which its controls may not be effective. Failure to manage risks effectively could adversely impact the Group’s reputation or compliance with regulatory obligations.\nThe effectiveness of the Group’s risk management framework is also connected to the establishment and maintenance of a sound risk management culture, which is supported by appropriate remuneration structures. If the remuneration structures are not designed or implemented effectively, then this could have an adverse impact on the Group’s risk culture and effectiveness of the Group’s risk management frameworks.\nThe Group seeks to continuously improve its risk management framework. It has implemented, and regularly reviews, its risk management policies and allocates additional resources across the organisation to manage and mitigate risks (including conduct risk). However, such efforts may not insulate the Group from future instances of misconduct and no assurance can be given that the Group’s risk management framework will be effective. A failure in the Group’s risk management processes or governance could result in the Group suffering unexpected losses and reputation damage, and failing to comply with regulatory obligations, which could adversely affect the Group’s Position.\n27. Risks associated with lending to customers that could be directly or indirectly impacted by climate risk may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nThe risks associated with climate change are subject to increasing regulatory, political and societal focus. Embedding climate change risk into the Group’s risk management framework in line with expectations, and adapting the Group’s operation and business strategy to address both the risks and opportunities posed by climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy could have a significant impact on the Group.\nThe Group’s most material climate-related risks result from its lending to business and retail customers, including credit-related losses incurred as a result of a customer being unable or unwilling to repay debt, or impacting the value and liquidity of collateral.\nThe risk to the Group through credit-related issues with the Group’s customers could result directly from climate-related events, and indirectly from changes to laws, regulations, or other policies such as carbon pricing and climate risk adaptation or mitigation policies, which may impact the customer’s supply chain or their own customer’s ability to purchase. This may result in credit-related losses as a result of the customer being unable or unwilling to repay debt, which may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\n28. Impact of future climate events, geological events, plant, animal and human diseases, and other extrinsic events may adversely affect the Group’s Position\nThe Group and its customers are exposed to climate-related events. These events include severe storms, drought, fires, cyclones, hurricanes, floods and rising sea levels. The Group and its customers may also be exposed to other events such as geological events (including volcanic seismic activity or tsunamis), plant, animal and human diseases or a pandemic.\nDepending on their severity, events such as these may temporarily interrupt or restrict the\n21\nprovision of some local services such as ANZ branch or business centers or Group services, and may also adversely affect the Group’s financial condition or collateral position in relation to credit facilities extended to customers, which in turn may adversely affect the Group’s Position.\n22\nResponsibility statement of the Directors of ANZBGL in accordance with Rule 4.1.12 (3)(b) of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority\nThe Directors of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited confirm to the best of their knowledge that:\nANZ’s 2019 Annual Financial Report (as defined on page 1 of this DTR Annual Financial Report submission) includes:\n(i)\na fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; together with\n(ii)\na description of the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group.\nSigned in accordance with a resolution of the Directors.\nDavid M Gonski, AC Chairman\nShayne C Elliott Director\n30 October 2019\n23"

Lee Hsien Yang retired as a Non-Executive Director on 19 December 2018.\n3.4 CEO and delegation to management\nThe Board appoints the CEO and certain members of the senior management team at ANZ, as set out in its Charter. The Board delegates to the CEO, and through the CEO to senior management, via the ANZ Delegations of Authority Policy, the authority and responsibility to make decisions with the aim of achieving the approved strategies and financial objectives of ANZ. This Policy is reviewed regularly.\nExCo generally meets each month and is responsible for delivering ANZ’s purpose, to shape a world where people and communities thrive. It does this by focusing on:\nANZ also has a number of formally established management committees, each of which deals with particular sets of ongoing issues with defined decision-making authority.\nAs part of implementing the Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR), individual accountability statements were developed and are maintained for ANZ’s Accountable Persons (all ANZ Directors and ExCo (other than the Group Executive, International) and the Group General Manager, Internal Audit). These contain a comprehensive statement of their individual responsibilities and acknowledgment of their accountability obligations under BEAR.\nAll key stakeholders;\nShaping ANZ’s culture and capabilities; and\nPrioritising ANZ’s efforts and allocation of resources.\nIn addition, ANZ maintains an Accountability Map for BEAR which describes the purpose of ANZ’s Board, Board committees and key management committees. The Map also includes mapping of management and governance arrangements across the Accountable Persons.\nThe ANZ Board Reserved Powers and ANZ Delegations of Authority policy together comprise a comprehensive Delegations of Authority Framework that applies to all employees and contractors of ANZ and its controlled entities.\n7\n3.5 Board composition, selection and appointment\nANZ reviews its Board composition regularly. The NBO Committee was created in 2019, with one of its duties being to assist the Board with all matters to do with reviewing Board composition. In assessing potential candidates and in undertaking reviews of the size and composition of the Board, the NBO Committee takes into account the guiding principle that the Board’s composition should reflect an appropriate mix having regard to such matters as:\nWhen considering potential candidates, the Board also notes that diversity has a much broader dimension and includes other matters such as age and cultural identity (for example, ethnicity and country of origin). The Committee also considers a candidate’s personal qualities, communication capabilities as well as ability to effectively challenge management, professional reputation and commitment to ethical behavior.\nskills/experience across the key areas identified in the ANZ Board Skills Matrix;\nThe Committee also reviews and recommends the succession planning for, and the process for electing, the Chairman of the Board, as required.\ntenure; and\ndiversity.\nThe NBO Committee also takes into account factors including:\nrelevant guidelines/legislative requirements in relation to Board composition;\nMore detailed information on ANZ’s nomination process an be found in ANZ’s Board Composition, Selection and Appointment document, available on ANZ’s website at anz.com/corporategovernance. In 2019 the Board undertook a comprehensive review of its Board skills matrix, to seek to ensure it remains appropriate for scheduled Board member rotation and to enable optimum Board performance.\nBoard membership requirements as articulated in the Board Charter; and\nother considerations including ANZ’s strategic goals.\nThe Board has an objective of maintaining at least 30% female membership of the Board, with a longer-term aspiration of having equal representation of females and males in its own composition.\nThe NBO Committee has been delegated responsibility to review and make recommendations to the Board regarding board size and composition, and to identify individuals believed to be qualified to become Board members and recommend such candidates to the Board.\n8\n3.6 Board skills and experience\nThe table below sets out the key skills and experience that the ANZ Board is looking to achieve in its membership and the number of Directors with each skill/experience.\nIn addition to having individuals on the Board with a variety of technical skills and experiences listed below, the ANZ Board seeks to ensure that its own membership will operate as a team, focused on the long-term success of the business and comprise different personalities and viewpoints, who will respectfully challenge management and each other and participate in robust debate and work with peers to arrive at new solutions.\nSKILLS AND EXPERIENCE\nNUMBER OF DIRECTORS\nStrategy and Commercial Acumen (knowledge and experience in charting and monitoring the implementation of strategic objectives using commercial judgment)\n8\nBanking and/or Financial Services (experience outside ANZ in significant components of the banking or financial services industry)\n7\nTechnology (knowledge and experience in the application and development within enterprises of major technology, data, technology related innovation or digital infrastructure or applications)\n3\nLeadership role in organisations of significant size (held CEO or senior position in a listed company or large/complex organisation or Government body)\n8\nWorkplace culture and/or remuneration (knowledge and experience at a senior level in the management or oversight of workplace culture matters and/or the oversight of remuneration practices and senior appointments)\n8\nCorporate Governance, Risk Management/Compliance and/or Sustainability (including but not limited to experience in the design and application of corporate governance, risk management/compliance and/or sustainability frameworks and related practices.

Those criteria are set out in the Board Charter and are reviewed by the NBO Committee regularly against the ASX Governance Principles, the APRA Prudential Standards, and the other relevant requirements.\nOver and above the issue of independence, each Director has a continuing responsibility to determine whether he or she has a potential, or actual, conflict of interest in relation to any material matter which relates to the affairs of ANZ. Such a situation may arise from external associations, interests or personal relationships.\nThe Audit Committee Charter sets additional independence criteria for Audit Committee members which is also considered.\nANZ has a Directors’ Disclosure of Interest Protocol and Procedures for Handling Conflicts of Interest. It provides that a Director may not exercise any influence over the Board if an actual or potential conflict of interest exists.\nFurther details of the criteria are set out on ANZ’s website at anz.com/corporategovernance\nThe Protocol contains more information around ANZ’s approach to handling conflicts of interest, which is available on ANZ’s website at anz.com/corporategovernance.\nANZ’s test for independence is whether a Director has a material relationship with ANZ. In summary, a relationship with ANZ is regarded as material if a reasonable person in the position of a Non-Executive Director of ANZ would expect there to be a real and sensible possibility that it would influence a Director’s mind in:\n3.9 Outside commitments of Non-Executive Directors\nAll Non-Executive Directors are required to notify the Chairman before accepting any new outside appointment. The Chairman reviews the proposed new appointment and considers the issue on an individual basis.\nmaking decisions on matters likely to come regularly before the Board or its Committees;\nobjectively assessing information and advice given by management;\nsetting policy for general application across ANZ; and\nThe process the Chairman follows in carrying out this review, and the factors considered, are set out in the Outside Commitments of Non-Executive Directors document, which is available on ANZ’s website at anz.com/corporategovernance.\ngenerally carrying out the performance of his or her role as a Director.\nDirectors are on the boards of companies and other organisations that have a commercial relationship with ANZ. Arrangements are in place (see Section 3.8) to seek to ensure that there are no independence issues arising from those relationships.\nIf the Chairman proposes to accept a new outside appointment, the longest serving Non-Executive Director substitutes for the Chairman for the purpose of the review and approval process set out above.\nANZ is comfortable with each of the outside commitments of the Non-Executive Directors.\nDirectors’ biographies as set out in the Directors’ Report (in the 2019 Annual Report) and located on ANZ’s website at anz.com/directors highlight their major associations outside ANZ.\nThe Board has reviewed each Non-Executive Director’s independence and concluded that each Non-Executive Director is independent.\n10\n4. Performance evaluations ANZ conducts performance evaluations of each Non-Executive Director, the Chairman of the Board, the Board and the Board Committees.\nDetails of the evaluation processes are summarised below and set out in more detail in ANZ’s Board Renewal and Performance Evaluation Protocol, which is available on ANZ’s website at anz.com/corporategovernance.\n4.1 Non-Executive Directors\nFor the evaluation of Non-Executive Directors, the Chairman has a one-on-one meeting with the Non-Executive Director regarding their performance, including compliance with the Non-Executive Directors’ Code of Conduct.\n4.2 Chairman of the Board\nANZ’s longest serving Non-Executive Director facilitates the evaluation of the performance of the Chairman. This involves seeking input from each Director.\n4.3 The Board\nOn a periodic basis, the performance of the Board is evaluated using an independent external facilitator. ANZ expects this evaluation to occur approximately every three years.\n4.4 Board Committees\nEach of the principal Board Committees conducts an annual self- assessment to evaluate the Committee’s performance using Guidelines approved by the NBO Committee.\n4.5 Senior executives\nThe Remuneration Report in the 2019 Annual Report sets out how the Board evaluates the performance of the CEO and other key senior executives, including how we assess Risk and Reputation, Financial and Discipline, Customer, and People and Culture measures.\nRelevant senior executive evaluations have been undertaken in respect of the 2019 financial year in accordance with this process.\n4.6 2019 evaluation processes undertaken\nAs at the time of this report, the 2019 financial year evaluations of the Chairman, Non-Executive Directors, the Board and Board Committees were being finalised and will be completed prior to the 2019 AGM.\n5. Other information 5.1 Fit and proper person checks and BEAR suitability\nANZ has processes that ensure individuals appointed to relevant senior positions have the appropriate fitness and propriety to properly discharge their prudential responsibilities.\nThe framework is set out in ANZ’s Fit and Proper Policy for APRA Regulated Institutions. Before a new appointment is made to any of the following positions, the policy requires assessments to be carried out: each Director, relevant senior executives, and the APRA engagement partner of ANZ’s External Auditor. The Board carries out assessments of ANZ’s Non-Executive Directors, the Human Resources Committee assesses the CEO and key senior executives and the Audit Committee assesses the APRA engagement partner of ANZ’s External Auditor. The assessment includes:\neach individual providing attestations;\nthe reviewer obtaining evidence of the individual’s material qualifications; and\nthe reviewer checking the individual’s past — for example: for any criminal record, bankruptcy history and regulatory disqualifications.\nDuring the 2019 financial year, Annual Fit and Proper assessments were carried out for each Non-Executive Director, the CEO, key senior executives and the APRA engagement partner of ANZ’s External Auditor.\nThe policy also sets out how the Board and Human Resources Committee assesses whether ANZ’s Accountable Persons are suitable to act in that capacity pursuant to the requirements of the BEAR.\nA Fit and Proper Policy summary with more information around the framework is available on ANZ’s website at anz.com/corporategovernance.\n5.2 Appointment documentation\nEach new Non-Executive Director receives an appointment letter with a:\nDirectors’ Handbook — the handbook includes information on a broad range of matters relating to the role of a Director, including information about all applicable policies; and\nDirector’s Deed — each Director signs a Deed, currently in the form approved by shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting.\nThe Deed covers a number of issues including indemnity, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, the right to obtain independent advice, confidentiality requirements and access to information.\nEach current Non-Executive Director received a letter at the commencement of their term which sets out the terms of their appointment.\nFormal letters are provided to senior executives setting out the terms of their appointment.\n5.3 Induction for directors\nANZ arranges an induction program which involves every new Director receiving information about: ANZ’s values and culture; the governance framework; the Non-Executive Directors’ Code of Conduct; Director related policies; Board and Committee policies, processes and key issues; financial management; and business operations. Directors are also briefed by senior management about matters concerning their areas of responsibility.\n11\n5.4 Directors right to independent advice\nTo help Directors fulfill their responsibilities, each Director has the right (with the prior approval of the Chairman) to seek independent professional advice, at ANZ’s expense, about his or her responsibilities. In addition, the Board and each principal Committee may, at ANZ’s expense, and with the approval of the Chairman, obtain whatever professional advice it requires to assist in its work.\n5.5 Meeting director share qualifications\n6. Role of company secretaries The Board is responsible for appointing ANZ’s Company Secretaries. The Board has appointed two Company Secretaries. Profiles of ANZ’s Company Secretaries can be found in the Directors’ Report (in the 2019 Annual Report). One of them is the Group General Counsel, Ken Adams. He is responsible for the provision of legal services to ANZ globally. He works closely with the Chairman, Directors and senior management and is responsible to the Board for the Company Secretary’s Office.\nWithin five years of each Non-Executive Director’s appointment, they must accumulate, and then maintain, a holding in ANZ shares that is equivalent to at least 100% of a Non-Executive Director’s base fee. The requirement for the Chairman is 200% of that fee. Each Non-Executive Director is in compliance with this requirement.\n5.6 Non-Executive Director and senior executive remuneration\nThe Company Secretary, Simon Pordage, is responsible for the operations of the Company Secretary’s Office including administering Board and Board Committee meetings and associated Board governance requirements for ANZ and its Australian subsidiaries, overseeing the relationship with ANZ’s Share Registrar and administering ANZ’s listed securities, including managing distributions, and communication and lodgment of information with, securities exchanges and corporate regulators.\nInformation about the structure of the Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration and the remuneration of the CEO and other senior executives is set out in the Remuneration Report in the 2019 Annual Report.\nHe is accountable directly to the Board, through the Chair, on all matters to do with the proper functioning of the Board.\n5.7 Election at next Annual General Meeting\nHe works closely with the Chair of the Board to develop and maintain ANZ’s corporate governance principles.\nAs allowed by ANZ’s Constitution and the Corporations Act 2001, the Board may appoint a Non-Executive Director of ANZ at any time. But that person must retire at the next Annual General Meeting.\nIf they wish to continue as a Director, they must seek election by shareholders at that Annual General Meeting.\nThe Company Secretary is accountable directly to the Board, through the Chair, on all matters to do with the proper functioning of the Board.\n5.8 Directors tenure and retirement\nANZ’s Constitution requires a Non-Executive Director who wishes to continue in their role to seek re-election by shareholders every three years. This is consistent with the ASX Listing Rules.\nIn addition, ANZ’s Board Renewal and Performance Evaluation Protocol requires Non-Executive Directors to retire when they have served three consecutive 3-year terms after first being elected by shareholders.\n7. Board Committees 7.1 Membership and attendance Each of the principal Board Committees:\nHowever, in special circumstances, the Board may invite them to extend their tenure.\nis comprised solely of independent Non-Executive Directors — and has at least three members;\nhas its own Charter;\n5.9 Continuing education for directors\nANZ Directors take part in a range of training and continuing education programs relating to their duties and responsibilities as Directors, in addition to a formal induction program.\nhas the power to initiate any special investigations it considers necessary; and\nhas the Board appoint one of its members as Chair.\nEach Committee also conducts its own continuing education sessions as appropriate and seeks to identify topics as part of their self-assessment. For example, the Audit Committee receives regular briefings on developments in accounting standards. Internal and external experts are engaged, as required, to conduct education sessions.\nEach year, the Board reviews Board Committee composition. The Chairman is an ex-officio member of each principal Board Committee and is Chair of the EESG Committee and NBO Committee. The CEO is invited to attend Board Committee meetings as appropriate. However, his presence is not automatic and he does not attend if his remuneration is being considered or discussed. Non-Executive Directors may, and are encouraged, to attend meetings of other Committees and are provided with papers for all meetings.\nEach Board Committee may, within the scope of its responsibilities, have unrestricted access to management, employees and information it considers relevant to the carrying out of its responsibilities under its Charter.\nEach Board Committee may require the attendance of any ANZ officer or employee, or request the attendance of any external party, at meetings as appropriate.\n12\n7.2 Audit Committee\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for providing oversight and independent review of:\nANZ’s financial reporting principles and policies, controls and\nprocedures;\nthe effectiveness of ANZ’s internal control and risk management framework;\nthe effectiveness of ANZ’s internal control and risk management framework;\nthe work of Internal Audit (IA) which reports directly to the Chair of the Audit Committee — see Section 8.1 of this Statement for more information about IA;\nthe integrity of ANZ’s financial statements and their independent audit, and compliance with related legal and regulatory requirements;\nprudential supervision procedures and other regulatory requirements (including reporting requirements) to the extent they relate to financial reporting; and reports from major subsidiary audit committees.\nThe Audit Committee is also responsible for:\nappointing, overseeing, and annually evaluating the External Auditor — including reviewing their independence, fitness and propriety and qualifications;\ncompensation of the External Auditor;\nif appropriate, replacing the External Auditor; and\nreviewing the performance and remuneration of the Group General Manager, Internal Audit and making recommendations to the Board as appropriate.\nUnder the Committee Charter:\neach member of the Audit Committee must be appropriately financially literate; and\ncollectively they must have the appropriate knowledge, skills and experience (including industry experience) to effectively discharge the Committee’s responsibilities.\nThe Board determined Paula Dwyer (Chair) was a ‘financial expert’ under the definition set out in the Audit Committee Charter. Although the Board determined that Paula has the necessary attributes to be a ‘financial expert’ in accordance with those requirements, it is important to note that this does not give Paula additional responsibilities to those of other members of the Audit Committee.\nThe Audit Committee meets with the External Auditor and internal auditor without Management being present. The Chair of the Audit Committee meets separately and regularly with IA, the External Auditor and Management. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer is the executive responsible for assisting the Chair of the Committee in connection with the administration and efficient operation of the Committee.\nThe CEO and CFO gave the Board the declarations concerning the Group’s 2019:\nfull year financial statements, and other matters, that are required by s295A of the Corporations Act and Recommendation 4.2 of the ASX Governance Principles;

Its duties include:\nWe have a risk management framework in place to monitor and manage ANZ’s key risks. The Board, with the endorsement of the Risk Committee, reviews the framework at least annually to satisfy itself that the framework continues to be sound and that ANZ is operating with due regard to the risk appetite set by the Board. This review was conducted during the 2019 financial year. The Annual Report contains further information on ANZ’s framework, including how it is structured with respect to the Three Lines-of- Defence Model and Risk Management Committee, actions taken to improve risk management during the year and emerging risks for ANZ. Under the Three Lines-of-Defence Model, the business has first line of defence responsibility, the Risk Function is the second line of defence and Internal Audit is the final line of defence.\nall matters to do with reviewing Board composition, including renewal and succession planning, the processes for Director selection, appointment and re-election, the effectiveness of ANZ’s approach to diversity, monitoring and making amendments to ANZ’s Board skills matrix, recommending individuals to the Board to be appointed as directors and succession planning for the Chairman of the Board;\nthe review and approval of processes for evaluating the performance of the Board, each principal Committee and each Director including the Chairman but excluding the CEO; and\nall other matters do to with the effective and efficient operation of the Board and its principal Committees, including NED induction and education and review and approval of Charters.\nThe Company Secretary is responsible for assisting the Chair of the Committee with the operation of the Committee.\n7.8 Additional Committees\nIn addition to the six principal Board Committees, the Board has constituted two Committees, consisting solely of Directors, to assist in carrying out specific tasks.

Audit and Financial Governance 8.1 Internal Audit Internal Audit (IA) is independent of management. Its role is to provide the Board and management with an independent appraisal of the internal controls established by ANZ’s first (business) and second (Group Risk) lines of defence. IA operates under a Board approved Charter. The outcome of IA’s work is reported through the Audit Committee Chair to the Audit Committee.

Its role is to provide the Board and management with an independent appraisal of the internal controls established by ANZ’s first (business) and second (Group Risk) lines of defence. IA operates under a Board approved Charter. The outcome of IA’s work is reported through the Audit Committee Chair to the Audit Committee. IA has a direct communication line to the Group Chief Executive and the External Auditor.\nThe IA team includes six General Managers accountable for the provision of audit services to their respective Divisions. The General Managers, together with the Head of Audit Services and Group General Manager, IA, form the IA Leadership Team. IA uses a global audit pool structure, which comprises individuals with skills in Technology, Credit Assurance, Culture Assessments, Data Analytics and Operational audits. The global team is spread across fourteen locations.\nIA operates to its annual IA Plan, which is developed and reviewed in line with ANZ’s overall risk appetite and risk management framework. The Audit Committee reviews and approves the annual IA Plan and any material changes to it. This ensures the Plan meets regulatory requirements and covers all material risks. The Audit Committee also approves the annual budget for the IA function.\nAll audit activities are conducted in accordance with ANZ policies and values, including ANZ’s Employee Code of Conduct, as well as local and international auditing standards promulgated by the professional auditing bodies. The Group General Manager, IA presents reports at each Audit Committee meeting. The reports cover: major activities and findings; statistics on issued audit reports and ratings; and information about the internal audit function — including progress on strategic initiatives, staffing and other related matters.\nIA assesses and reports on the effective and timely resolution of audit issues raised.\n8.2 External audit\nThe External Auditor’s role is to provide an independent opinion that ANZ’s financial reports are true and fair and comply with accounting standards and applicable regulations. The External Auditor performs an independent audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. The Audit Committee oversees ANZ’s Stakeholder Engagement Model for Relationship with the External Auditor (Stakeholder Engagement Model).\nUnder the Stakeholder Engagement Model, the Audit Committee is responsible for appointing (subject to ratification by shareholders) and also compensating, retaining and overseeing the conduct of the external audit.\nThe Stakeholder Engagement Model also stipulates that the Audit Committee:\npre-approves all audit, audit related and non-audit services either on an engagement-by-engagement basis or under a specific service pre-approved by the Committee;\nregularly reviews the independence of the External Auditor; and\nevaluates the effectiveness of the External Auditor.\nThe Stakeholder Engagement Model can be found on ANZ’s website at: anz.com/corporategovernance\nThe Stakeholder Engagement Model contains a number of requirements as to non-audit services that the External Auditor may provide, as well as recruitment and rotation requirements of external auditor staff.\nInformation about the non-audit services provided by the External Auditor, KPMG, during the 2019 financial year is set out in the Directors’ Report in the 2019 Annual Report. That information includes the cost of those services and a statement from the Board as to its satisfaction with KPMG’s compliance with the related independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001. In addition, the auditor has provided an independence declaration under Section 307C of the Corporations Act 2001.\n8.3 Financial controls\nThe Audit Committee oversees: ANZ’s financial reporting policies and controls; the integrity of ANZ’s financial statements; the relationship with the External Auditor; the work of IA; and the audit committees of various significant subsidiary companies.\nANZ maintains a financial reporting governance framework that assesses the design of, and tests the operational effectiveness of, key financial reporting controls.

The attestation comprises representations on financial results, financial reporting disclosures, compliance obligations and control. The attestation is aligned with ANZ’s external reporting obligations.\n17\n9. Ethical and responsible decision-making\n9.1 Codes of conduct\n9.3 Whistleblower protection\nANZ has two Codes of Conduct — the Employee Code and the Non-Executive Directors Code (the Codes). The Employee Code supports ANZ’s values and provides ANZ employees with a practical set of guiding principles to help them make fair, balanced and ethical decisions in their day-to-day work. The Non-Executive Directors Code recognises the different responsibilities that Directors have under law and enshrines the same values and principles as the Employee Code.\nANZ has a strong values based culture that encourages openness, integrity and accountability. The Whistleblower Policy has been developed to ensure that all current and former employees, officers, associates, contractors and sub-contractors of the ANZ group, including relatives of those aforementioned individuals, can freely and without fear of detriment raise concerns regarding actual or suspected misconduct by ANZ, or anyone connected to the ANZ group, including contraventions of ANZ’s ethical and legal standards.\nThe Codes require honesty, integrity, quality and trust. ANZ employees and Directors are required to demonstrate these behaviours and to comply with the Codes. The Codes are supported by a suite of policies that are reviewed regularly to ensure they reflect any changes in law and otherwise remain fit for purpose. Directors’ compliance with the Non-Executive Directors Code forms part of their usual annual performance review.\nA whistleblower can make a confidential disclosure under the Policy in a number of ways, including through a Whistleblower Protection Officer, the Whistleblower Program team, or anonymously via phone, email and web-based mechanisms operated by ANZ’s external whistleblower reporting service, operated by a third party provider (Deloitte). ANZ maintains confidentiality of all reports to the fullest extent possible and also protects whistleblowers from retaliation or victimization.\nThe Codes are available on ANZ’s website at anz.com/corporategovernance. ANZ’s 2019 Annual Report contains information on work undertaken during the year with respect to ANZ’s conduct and culture (including breaches). Further information about the Codes, including on internal training and breaches, will be available in ANZ’s 2019 ESG Supplement (to be released in December).\n9.2 Securities trading\nANZ’s Whistleblower Program team reports to the Operational Risk Executive Committee and Audit Committee twice annually on reports made in the preceding period, including de-identified thematic details of reports made and actions taken. It also reports to any boards and committees of the ANZ group in a manner agreed between the Whistleblower Program and the relevant board from time to time. Any reports involving a Director or the CEO of ANZ would be reported to the Chair of ANZ.\nThe Trading in ANZ Securities Policy prohibits trading in ANZ securities by all employees, Directors and contractors who possess information that is not generally available and that could be reasonably expected to have a material, or significant, effect on the price, or value, of an ANZ security.\nThe Policy specifically prohibits ANZ Directors and certain ‘restricted persons’ (which includes certain senior executives) and their associates from trading in ANZ securities during ‘blackout periods’ as defined in the Policy. The Policy:\nexcludes certain types of trading from the trading restrictions under the Policy;\nallows in exceptional circumstances, and with prior written clearance, trading during a prohibited period;\nprohibits employees and their associates from hedging interests that have been granted under any ANZ employee equity plan that are either unvested or subject to a holding lock; and\nprohibits ANZ Directors and restricted persons from using ANZ securities in connection with a margin loan or similar financing arrangement which may be subject to a margin call or loan-to- value ratio breach. The Policy was updated in 2019 and is available on ANZ’s website at anz.com/corporategovernance.\n18\n10. Commitment to shareholders\n10.1 Communication\nTo be able to make informed decisions about ANZ, and to communicate views to ANZ, shareholders need an understanding of ANZ’s business operations, performance and governance framework.\nGenerally, we do that through our reporting of results, the Annual Report (which now incorporates the Annual Review), announcements and briefings to the market, half yearly newsletters and through our dedicated shareholder site anz.com/shareholder/centre.\nWe strive for transparency in all our business practices, and we recognise the impact of quality disclosure on the trust and confidence of shareholders, the wider market and the community. To this end, ANZ, in addition to its scheduled results announcements, issued Trading Updates to the market during the 2019 financial year.\nIf you require any information or wish to express your view to ANZ on any matters of concern or interest, then the contact details for ANZ Investor Relations and ANZ’s Share Registrar, Computershare Investor Services (including postal, telephone and email) are set out in ANZ’s 2019 Annual Report and on ANZ’s website at: anz.com/annualreport.\nANZ shareholders have the option of receiving communications from, and sending communications to, ANZ and its Share Registrar electronically.\nANZ also has a comprehensive investor relations program, which facilitates effective communication with investors.\n10.2 Meetings\nTo allow as many shareholders as possible to have an opportunity to attend shareholder meetings, ANZ rotates meetings around capital cities and makes them available to be viewed online using webcast technology.\nInformation on meetings and presentations held throughout this financial year are available on ANZ’s website at: anz.com/shareholder/centre\nBefore the Annual General Meeting, shareholders have the opportunity to submit questions to the Chairman or CEO to enable key common themes to be considered during the meeting.\nThe External Auditor attends ANZ Annual General Meetings and is available to answer shareholder questions on any matter that concerns them in their capacity as auditor.\nDirectors are also required to attend the Annual General Meeting, except in unusual circumstances. After the meeting, they are available to meet with, and answer questions from, shareholders.\nShareholders have the right to vote on various resolutions related to company matters. Shareholders are encouraged to attend and participate in meetings. But, if they are unable to attend a meeting, then they can submit their proxies via post or electronically.

Those results are reported as soon as possible to ASX and posted on ANZ’s website at : anz.com/shareholder/centre\nANZ’s Notice of 2018 Annual General Meeting contained all material information in its possession relevant to the business of the meeting, including the election and re-election of Director at that AGM.\nANZ encourages shareholders to take an active interest in ANZ, and seeks to provide shareholders with quality information in a timely fashion.\n11. Continuous disclosure ANZ’s practice is to release market sensitive information:\nto ASX promptly and without delay as required under ASX Listing Rules;\nthen to all relevant overseas securities exchanges on which ANZ’s securities are listed; and\nthen to the market and community generally through ANZ’s media releases, website and other appropriate channels.\nDesignated Disclosure Officers are generally responsible for reviewing proposed disclosures and making decisions in relation to what information will be disclosed to the market. ANZ employees and contractors must inform the Company Secretary (or in his absence, the Group General Counsel) of any potentially price sensitive information concerning ANZ as soon as they become aware of it. ANZ’s Board receives copies of all market announcements promptly after they have been made. Any new and substantive investor or analyst presentation is released to the ASX ahead of the presentation.\nA summary of ANZ’s Continuous Disclosure Policy is available on ANZ’s website at anz.com/corporategovernance.\n12. Economic, environmental and social sustainability risks Details of ANZ’s material economic, environmental and social sustainability risks, as well as details of how ANZ manages those risks, are referred to in the ANZ’s Principal Risks and Uncertainties Disclosure and in the Annual Report, which are available on ANZ’s website at anz.com/annualreport.\n19\nDiversity and inclusion at ANZ\n13.

This represents a 1.4% increase from 31.1% at 30 September 2017.\nSince 2016, we have recruited 734 people from under-represented groups. This figure is made up of 306 Indigenous Australians, 343 people with a disability, and 85 refugees.\n13.2 Leadership, governance and accountability\n13.4 Gender balance at Board, senior executive and management levels\nANZ’s Human Resources Committee plays an important role in relation to ANZ’s people strategy, remuneration strategy and approach to diversity and inclusion (including gender diversity).\nThe Human Resources Committee has an overarching role to:\nreview, note and monitor the effectiveness of ANZ’s approach to diversity and inclusion;\nAs at the date of this report, ANZ’s Board comprises eight directors, one Executive Director (the CEO), and seven Non-Executive Directors, three of whom are women. Female representation on the Board is now at 37.5%. The Board’s current objective is to maintain at least 30% female representation on the Board. In the long term, the Board’s aspirational goal is to have equal representation of females and males in its own composition.\nreview and approve measurable objectives for achieving diversity and inclusion; and\nreview annually both those objectives and progress in achieving them, including the relative proportion of women at all levels.\nANZ has five women on its 11-person ExCo (45.5% female representation): the Chief Financial Officer; the Group Executive Talent and Culture; the Group Executive Digital and Australia Transformation; the Acting CEO New Zealand, and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Group Executive Wealth Australia.\nThe Human Resources Committee also reviews annual performance and remuneration outcomes.

Introduction\nPurpose of this document\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) ADI Prudential Standard (APS) 330: Public Disclosure.\nAPS 330 mandates the release to the investment community and general public of information relating to capital adequacy and risk management practices. APS 330 was established to implement Pillar 3 of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s framework for bank capital adequacy2. In simple terms, the Basel framework consists of three mutually reinforcing ‘Pillars’:\nPillar 1\nPillar 2\nPillar 3\nMinimum capital requirement\nSupervisory review process\nMarket discipline\nMinimum capital requirements for Credit Risk, Operational Risk, Market Risk and Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book\nFirm-wide risk oversight, Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), consideration of additional risks, capital buffers and targets and risk concentrations, etc.\nRegular disclosure to the market of qualitative and quantitative aspects of capital adequacy and underlying risk metrics\nrisk management,\nAPS 330 requires the publication of various levels of information on a quarterly, semi-annual and annual basis. This document is the annual disclosure.\nBasel in ANZ\nIn December 2007, ANZ received accreditation for the most advanced approaches permitted under Basel for credit risk and operational risk, complementing its accreditation for market risk. Effective January 2013, ANZ adopted APRA requirements for Basel III with respect to the measurement and monitoring of regulatory capital.\nVerification of disclosures\nThese Pillar 3 disclosures have been verified in accordance with Board approved policy, including ensuring consistency with information contained in ANZ’s Financial Report and in Pillar 1 returns provided to APRA. In addition, ANZ’s external auditor has performed an agreed upon procedure review with respect to these disclosures.\nComparison to ANZ’s Financial Reporting\nThese disclosures have been produced in accordance with regulatory capital adequacy concepts and rules, rather than with accounting policies adopted in ANZ’s financial reports. As such, there are different areas of focus and measures in some common areas of disclosures. These differences are most pronounced in the credit risk disclosures, for instance:\nThe principal method for measuring the amount at risk is Exposure at Default (EAD), which is the estimated amount of exposure likely to be owed on a credit obligation at the time of default. Under the Advanced Internal Ratings Based (AIRB) approach in APS 113 Capital Adequacy: Internal Ratings-based Approach to Credit Risk, banks are accredited to provide their own estimates of EAD for all exposures (drawn, commitments or contingents) reflecting the current balance as well as the likelihood of additional drawings prior to default.\n\nLoss Given Default (LGD) is an estimate of the amount of losses expected in the event of default. LGD is essentially calculated as the amount at risk (EAD) less expected net recoveries from realisation of collateral as well as any post default repayments of principal and interest.\nMost credit risk disclosures split ANZ’s portfolio into regulatory asset classes, which span different areas of ANZ’s internal divisional and business unit organisational structure.\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts are rounded to AUD millions.\n2 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework, 2004.\n3\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 Disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nChapter 2 – Risk appetite and governance\nRisk types: ANZ is exposed to a broad range of inter-related business risks.\n\nCapital Adequacy risk is the risk of loss arising from the Group failing to maintain the level of capital required by prudential regulators and other key stakeholders (shareholders, debt investors, depositors, rating agencies, etc.) to support ANZ’s consolidated operations and risk appetite.\n\nCompliance risk is the risk of failure to act in accordance with laws, regulations, industry standards and codes, internal policies and procedures and principles of good governance as applicable to ANZ’s businesses.\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from a counterparty failing to fulfil its obligations or a decrease in credit quality of a counterparty resulting in a financial loss. Credit Risk incorporates the risks associated with us lending to customers who could be impacted by climate change or by changes to laws, regulations, or other policies adopted by governments or regulatory authorities, including carbon pricing and climate change adaptation or mitigation policies.\n\nEquity risk is the risk of financial loss arising from the unexpected reduction in value of equity investments not held in the trading book including those of the Group’s associates.\n\nInsurance risk is risk of unexpected losses resulting from worse than expected claims experience, including any of the following that expose an insurer to financial loss: inadequate or inappropriate underwriting, claims management, reserving, insurance concentrations, reinsurance management, product design and pricing.\nMarket risk stems from ANZ’s trading and balance sheet activities and is the risk to the Group’s earnings arising from changes in any interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, volatility, and correlations or from fluctuations in bond, commodity or equity prices.\n\nLiquidity and Funding risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due, including repaying depositors or maturing wholesale debt or the Group having insufficient capacity to fund increases in assets.\nOperational risk is risk of loss and/or non-compliance with laws resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and/or systems, or from external events. This definition includes legal risk, and the risk of reputation loss, or damage arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, but excludes strategic risk.\nReputation risk\nis defined as the risk of loss that directly or indirectly impacts earnings, capital adequacy or value, that is caused by adverse perceptions of the Group held by any of customers, the community, 3 shareholders, investors, regulators, or rating agencies, conduct risk associated with the Group’s employees or contractors (or both) or the social or environmental (or both) impacts of our lending decisions.\n\nSecuritisation risk is the risk of credit related losses greater than expected due to a securitisation failing to operate as anticipated, or of the values and risks accepted or transferred, not emerging as expected.\n\nStrategic risk is the risk that the Group’s business strategy and strategic objectives may lead to an increase in other key Material Risks — for example: Credit Risk, Market Risk and Operational Risk.\n\nTechnology risk is the risk of loss and/or non-compliance with laws resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events impacting on IT assets, including the compromise of an IT asset’s confidentiality, integrity or availability.\n3 Regulatory Capital is calculated in accordance with the definition of Operational Risk outlined in APS 115 Capital Adequacy: Advanced Measurement Approaches to Operational Risk, and therefore excludes reputation risk considerations.\n4\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 Disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nRisk Appetite Framework\nANZ's Board is ultimately responsible for ANZ’s risk management framework, which includes the Group Risk Appetite Statement (RAS). The Group RAS is the document which clearly and concisely sets out the Board’s expectations regarding the degree of risk that ANZ is prepared to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives and business plan.\nThe articulation of risk appetite and risk tolerances is central to the risk appetite statement. ANZ’s Group RAS conveys the following:\nThe degree of risk (risk appetite) that ANZ is prepared to accept in pursuit of its strategy, objectives and business plans with consideration of its shareholders’ and customers’ best interests.\nFor each material risk, ANZ has set the maximum level of risk (risk tolerance) that it is willing to operate within, expressed as a risk limit and based on its risk appetite, risk profile and capital strength. Risk tolerances translate risk appetite into operational limits for the day-to-day management of material risks, where possible.\nThe process for ensuring that risk tolerances are set at an appropriate level, based on an estimate of the impact in the event that a risk tolerance is breached, and the likelihood that each material risk is realised.\nThe process for monitoring compliance with each risk tolerance and for taking appropriate action in the event that it is breached; and\nThe timing and process for review of the risk appetite and risk tolerances.\nRisk management governance\nThe Board is principally responsible for overseeing the establishment by Management of a sound risk management culture with an operational structure and the necessary resources to facilitate effective risk management throughout ANZ, and which in turn supports the ability of ANZ to operate consistently within its risk appetite and approves the risk appetite within which management is expected to operate and including ANZ’s risk appetite statement and risk management strategy. The Committees and their purpose are:\nRisk Committee The purpose of the Risk Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in the effective discharge of its responsibilities for business, market, credit, equity and other investment, financial, operational, liquidity and reputational risk management and for the management of the Group’s compliance obligations. The Risk Committee also assists the Board by providing an objective non-executive oversight of the implementation by management of ANZ’s risk management framework and its related operation and by enabling an institution-wide view of ANZ’s current and future risk position relative to its risk appetite and capital strength. The Committee meets at least four times annually.\nAudit Committee Assists the Board of Directors in reviewing: financial reporting principles and policies, controls and procedures; the effectiveness of ANZ's internal control and risk management framework; the work of Internal Audit which reports directly to the Board Audit Committee; the integrity of ANZ’s financial statements and the independent audit thereof and compliance with related legal and regulatory requirements; due diligence procedures; prudential supervision procedures and other regulatory requirements to the extent relating to financial reporting and for reviewing reports from major subsidiary audit committees. It’s also responsible for the appointment and evaluation of the external auditor. The committee meets at least four times annually.\nDigital Business and Technology Committee The purpose of the Digital Business and Technology Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in the effective discharge of its responsibilities in connection with the oversight of ANZ’s information technology, digitalisation and technology-related innovation strategies. The Committee meets at least three times annually.\nHuman Resource Committee The Committee is responsible for, among other matters, reviewing and making recommendations to the Board with regard to the remuneration of ANZ Board Appointees and ANZ Material Risk Takers, the design of executive remuneration structures and significant incentive plans and the Group’s Remuneration Policy. It also approves the appointment and termination of ANZ Board Appointees (excluding the CEO, CRO and GGM-IA4), reviews senior executive succession plans and monitors the effectiveness of ANZ’s culture, employee engagement and diversity and inclusion programs. The Committee meets at least four times annually.\nEthics, Environment, Social and Governance Committee Amongst other matters, the Committee reviews the development of and approves all other corporate governance policies and principles applicable to ANZ and seeks to ensure an appropriate Board and Committee structure is in place. It seeks to ensure there is a robust and effective process for evaluating the performance of the Board, Board Committee and Non-Executive Directors. It also reviews, monitors and approves ANZ’s corporate sustainability objectives and provides advice to management on sustainability issues within ANZ. The Committee meets at least twice annually.\nThe above Committees are exclusively comprised of Non-Executive directors. Members, including the Chair are appointed by the Board and serve at the discretion of the Board and for such term or terms as the Board determines.\nProcesses and procedures relating to the operation of each of the board committees are documented in the committee charters and in the Board Committees’ Standing Rules.\n4 CRO: Chief Risk Officer; GGM-IA: Group General Manager-Internal Audit\n5\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 Disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nExecutive Management Committees are responsible for co-ordination of risk matters for each of the areas of risk management. The Executive Management Committees most relevant to the risks described above and overall capital management at ANZ are as follows:\nGroup Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO)\nGALCO is responsible for the oversight and strategic management of the ANZ’s balance sheet activities including balance sheet structure, liquidity, funding, capital management, non-traded interest rate risk, and non-traded FX risks and exposures. The Committee meets at least 4 times a year, or more frequently as required.\nCredit and Market Risk Committee (CMRC) CMRC is responsible for the oversight and control of credit, market, insurance and material financial risks across the ANZ Group. The Committee meets monthly, with additional meetings as required.\nOperational Risk Executive Committee (OREC) OREC is responsible for oversight of and monitoring Operational and Compliance Risk and the related Control Environment, setting policies and frameworks for the implementation across ANZ. The committee meets at least six times per year, with additional meetings as required.\nEthics and Responsible Business Committee (ERBC) ERBC is a leadership and decision making body that exists to advance ANZ’s purpose, namely to shape a world where people and communities thrive. The Committee meets at least 4 times a year, or more frequently as required.\nCredit Ratings System Oversight Committee (CRSOC) CRSOC is a sub-committee of CMRC responsible for the oversight and control of the Internal Ratings System for credit risk including credit model approvals and performance monitoring. The Committee meets at least 4 times a year, or more frequently as required.\nCapital and Stress Testing Oversight Committee (CSTOC) CSTOC is responsible for the oversight and control of the Group’s stress testing framework, modelling and processes, economic profit methodology and framework, capital allocation framework and other capital management (apart from Group ICAAP) and portfolio measurement related recommendations. The Committee meets a minimum of three times per year, with additional meetings at the discretion of the Chair. CSTOC is a sub-committee of GALCO.\nProcesses and procedures relating to the operation of each of the Executive Management Committees are documented in the committee charters.\n6\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 Disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nChapter 3 – Capital reporting and measurement\nCapital reporting and measurement\nTo ensure that an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) is adequately capitalised on both a standalone and group basis, APRA adopts a tiered approach to the measurement of an ADI’s capital adequacy by assessing the ADI’s financial strength at three levels:\nLevel 1 - being the ADI i.e. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, consolidated with APRA approved subsidiaries, to form the ADI’s Extended Licensed Entity (ELE).\nLevel 2 - being the consolidated group for financial reporting purposes adjusted to exclude associates activities and certain subsidiaries referenced under APS 001: Definitions that undertake the following business activities:\n•\n•\nInsurance businesses (including friendly societies and health funds). Acting as manager, responsible entity, approved trustee, trustee or similar role in relation to funds management. Non-financial (commercial) operations. Securitisation special purpose vehicles to which assets have been transferred in accordance with APRA's requirements as set out in APS 120: Securitisation.\nLevel 3 – the consolidated group for financial reporting purposes.\nAPRA is extending its prudential supervision framework to Conglomerate Groups via the Level 3 framework which will regulate a bancassurance group such as ANZ as a single economic entity with minimum capital requirements and additional monitoring of risk exposure levels.\nIn August 2016, APRA confirmed the deferral of capital requirements for Conglomerate Groups to allow for the final capital requirements arising from FSI recommendations and from international initiatives to be determined.\nThe non-capital components of the Level 3 framework relating to group governance, risk exposures, intragroup transactions and other risk management and compliance requirements came into effect on 1 July 2017. These have had no material impact on the Group’s capital position\nThis Pillar 3 report is based on the Level 2 prudential structure.\nRefer to Note 25 Controlled Entities of ANZ’s 2019 Annual Report for a list of all material subsidiaries and a brief description of their key activities.\n7\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 Disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nChapter 4 – Capital and Capital Adequacy\nTable 1\nCapital Disclosure template\nThe head of the Level 2 Group to which this prudential standard applies is Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited.\nTable 1 of this chapter consists of a Capital Disclosure template that assists users in understanding the differences between the application of the Basel III reforms in Australia and those rules as detailed in the document Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems, issued by the Bank for International Settlements.\nThe information in the lines of the template has been mapped to ANZ’s Level 2 balance sheet, which adjusts for non- consolidated subsidiaries as required under APS 001: Definitions. Where this information cannot be mapped on a one to one basis, it is provided in an explanatory table. ANZ’s material non-consolidated subsidiaries are also listed in this chapter.\nRestrictions on Transfers of Capital within ANZ\nANZ operates branches and locally incorporated subsidiaries in many countries. These operations are capitalised at an appropriate level to cover the risks in the business and to meet local prudential requirements. This level of capitalisation may be enhanced to meet local taxation and operational requirements. Any repatriation of capital from subsidiaries or branches is subject to meeting the requirements of the local prudential regulator and/or the local central bank. Apart from ANZ’s operations in New Zealand, local country capital requirements do not impose any material call on ANZ’s capital base.\nANZ undertakes banking activities in New Zealand principally through its wholly owned subsidiary, ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited, which is subject to minimum capital requirements as set by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ). The RBNZ adopted the Basel II framework, effective from 1 January 2008 and Basel III reforms from 1 January 2013. ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited has been accredited to use the advanced approach for the calculation of credit risk and standardised approach for operational risk. ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited maintains a buffer above the minimum capital base required by the RBNZ. This capital buffer has been calculated via the ICAAP undertaken for ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited, to ensure ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited is appropriately capitalised under stressed economic scenarios.\n8\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 Disclosure\nTable 1\nCapital disclosure template\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital: instruments and reserves\n1\nDirectly issued qualifying ordinary shares (and equivalent for mutually-owned entities) capital\n2\nRetained earnings\n3\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (and other reserves)\n4\nDirectly issued capital subject to phase out from CET1 (only applicable to mutually-owned companies)\n5\nOrdinary share capital issued by subsidiaries and held by third parties (amount allowed in group CET1)\n6\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital before regulatory adjustments\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital : regulatory adjustments\n7\nPrudential valuation adjustments\n8\nGoodwill (net of related tax liability)\n9\nOther intangibles other than mortgage servicing rights (net of related tax liability)\n10\nDeferred tax assets that rely on future profitability excluding those arising from temporary differences (net of related tax liability)\n11\nCash-flow hedge reserve\n12\nShortfall of provisions to expected losses\n13\nSecuritisation gain on sale\n14\nGains and losses due to changes in own credit risk on fair valued liabilities\n15\nDefined benefit superannuation fund net assets\n16\nInvestments in own shares (if not already netted off paid-in capital on reported balance sheet)\n17\nReciprocal cross-holdings in common equity\n18\nInvestments in the capital of banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regulatory consolidation, net of eligible short positions, where the ADI does not own more than 10% of the issued share capital (amount above 10% threshold)\n19\nSignificant investments in the ordinary shares of banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regulatory consolidation, net of eligible short positions (amount above 10% threshold)\n20\nMortgage service rights (amount above 10% threshold)\n21\nDeferred tax assets arising from temporary differences (amount above 10% threshold, net of related tax liability)\n22\nAmount exceeding the 15% threshold\n23\nof which: significant investments in the ordinary shares of financial entities\n24\nof which: mortgage servicing rights\n25\nof which: deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences\n26\nNational specific regulatory adjustments (sum of rows 26a -

features of ANZ’s capital instruments are updated on an ongoing basis, ANZ has provided this information separately in the Regulatory Disclosures section of its website.\nTable 3 The above tables are produced at the quarters ending 30 June and 31 December.\nCapital adequacy, Table 4 Credit risk, Table 5 Securitisation\nTable 6\nCapital adequacy\nCapital management\nANZ pursues an active approach to capital management, which is designed to protect the interests of depositors, creditors and shareholders. This involves the on-going review and Board approval of the level and composition of ANZ’s capital base, assessed against the following key policy objectives:\nRegulatory compliance such that capital levels exceed APRA’s, ANZ’s primary prudential supervisor, minimum Prudential Capital Ratios (PCRs) both at Level 1 (the Company and specified subsidiaries) and Level 2 (ANZ consolidated under Australian prudential standards), along with US Federal Reserve’s minimum Level 2 requirements under ANZ’s Foreign Holding Company Licence in the United States of America;\nCapital levels are aligned with the risks in the business and to meet strategic and business development; and\nAn appropriate balance between maximising shareholder returns and prudent capital management principles.\nANZ achieves these objectives through an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) where by ANZ conducts detailed strategic and capital planning over a medium term time horizon. The Capital Plan is maintained and updated through a monthly review of forecast financial performance, economic conditions and development of business initiatives and strategies. The Board and senior management are provided with monthly updates of ANZ’s capital position. Any actions required to ensure ongoing prudent capital management are submitted to the Board for approval. ANZ annually conducts a detailed strategic planning process over a three year time horizon, the outcomes of which are embodied in the Strategic Plan. This process involves forecasting key economic variables which Divisions use to determine key financial data for their existing business. New strategic initiatives to be undertaken over the planning period and their financial impact are then determined. These processes are used for the following:\nReview capital ratios, targets, and levels of different classes of capital against ANZ’s risk profile and risk appetite outlined in the Strategic Plan. ANZ’s capital targets reflect the key policy objectives above, and the desire to ensure that under specific stressed economic scenarios that capital levels are sufficient to remain above PCR requirements;\nStress tests are performed under different economic conditions to provide a comprehensive review of ANZ’s capital position both before and after mitigating actions. The stress tests determine the level of additional capital (i.e. the ‘stress capital buffer’) needed to absorb losses that may be experienced during an economic downturn; and\nStress testing is integral to strengthening the predictive approach to risk management and is a key component in managing risks, asset writing strategies and business strategies. It creates greater understanding of the impacts on financial performance through modelling relationships and sensitivities between geographic, industry and Divisional exposures under a range of macro-economic scenarios. ANZ has a dedicated stress testing team within Risk Management that models and reports to management and the Board’s Risk Committee on a range of scenarios and stress tests.\nResults are subsequently used to: •\nRecalibrate ANZ’s management targets for minimum and operating ranges for its respective classes of capital such that ANZ will have sufficient capital to remain above regulatory requirements; and\n\nIdentify the level of organic capital generation and hence determine current and future capital issuance requirements for Level 1 and Level 2.\nFrom these processes, a Capital Plan is developed and approved by the Board which identifies the capital issuance requirements, capital securities maturity profile, and options around capital products, timing and markets to execute the Capital Plan under differing market and economic conditions.\nThe Capital Plan is maintained and updated through a monthly review of forecast financial performance, economic conditions and development of business initiatives and strategies. The Board and senior management are provided with monthly updates of ANZ’s capital position. Any actions required to ensure ongoing prudent capital management are submitted to the Board for approval.\n19\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 Disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nRegulatory environment\nANZ’s regulatory capital calculation is governed by APRA’s Prudential Standards which adopt a risk-based capital assessment framework based on the Basel III capital measurement standards. This risk-based approach requires eligible capital to be divided by total risk weighted assets (RWA), with the resultant ratio being used as a measure of an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution’s (ADIs) capital adequacy. APRA determines PCRs for Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 and Total Capital, with capital as the numerator and RWAs as the denominator.\nRegulatory capital is divided into Tier 1, carrying the highest capital elements, and Tier 2, which has lower capital elements, but still adds to the overall strength of the ADI.\nTier 1 capital is comprised of Common Equity Tier 1 capital less deductions and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments. Common Equity Tier 1 capital comprises shareholders’ equity adjusted for items which APRA does not allow as regulatory capital or classifies as lower forms of regulatory capital. Common Equity Tier 1 capital includes the following significant adjustments:\nReserves exclude the hedging reserve and reserves of insurance and funds management subsidiaries;\nRetained and current year earnings excluding those of insurance and funds management subsidiaries, but includes capitalised deferred fees forming part of loan yields that meet the criteria set out in the prudential standard;\n\nInclusion of qualifying treasury shares.\nAdditional Tier 1 capital instruments are high quality components of capital that provide a permanent and unrestricted commitment of funds, are available to absorb losses, are subordinated to the claims of depositors and senior creditors in the event of the winding up of the issuer and provide for fully discretionary capital distributions.\nDeductions from the capital base comprise mainly deductions to the Common Equity Tier 1 component. These deductions are largely intangible assets, investments in insurance and funds management entities and associates, capitalised expenses (including loan and origination fees), and net deferred tax assets.\nTier 2 capital mainly comprises perpetual subordinated debt instruments and dated subordinated debt instruments which have a minimum term of five years at issue date.\nTotal Capital is the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital.\nIn addition to the prudential capital oversight that APRA conducts over the Company and the Group, the Company’s branch operations and major banking subsidiary operations are overseen by local regulators such as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the US Federal Reserve, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the China Banking Regulatory Commission who may impose minimum capitalisation rates on those operations.\nThroughout the financial year, the Company and the Group maintained compliance with the minimum Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios set by APRA and the US Federal Reserve (as applicable) as well as applicable capitalisation rates set by regulators in countries where the Company operates branches and subsidiaries.\nRegulatory development There are a number of matters currently outstanding that may have an impact on ANZ’s regulatory capital in the future. Details of these matters are available in ANZ’s 2019 Full Year Results Announcement Group Results section, pages 50-51, available on ANZ’s website: shareholder.anz.com/pages/results-announcement-archive.\n20\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 Disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nTable 6\nCapital adequacy - Capital Ratio and Risk Weighted Assets 6 7\nThe following table provides the composition of capital used for regulatory purposes and capital adequacy ratios.\nSep 19\nMar 19\nSep 18\nRisk weighted assets\n$M\n$M\n$M\nSubject to Advanced Internal Rating Based (IRB) approach\nCorporate\n136,885\n127,989\n121,891\nSovereign\n6,199\n7,016\n6,955\nBank\n15,968\n15,511\n15,908\nResidential Mortgage\n105,491\n101,469\n97,764\nQualifying Revolving Retail\n5,255\n5,795\n6,314\nOther Retail\n26,258\n28,029\n29,373\nCredit risk weighted assets subject to Advanced IRB approach\n296,056\n285,809\n278,205\nCredit risk Specialised Lending exposures subject to slotting approach6\n36,318\n35,696\n33,110\nSubject to Standardised approach\nCorporate\n11,645\n12,252\n13,760\nResidential Mortgage\n216\n331\n327\nOther Retail\n50\n81\n88\nCredit risk weighted assets subject to Standardised approach\n11,911\n12,664\n14,175\nCredit Valuation Adjustment and Qualifying Central Counterparties\n8,682\n6,217\n7,344\nCredit risk weighted assets relating to securitisation exposures\n1,859\n1,558\n1,600\nOther assets\n3,280\n3,579\n3,146\nTotal credit risk weighted assets\n358,106\n345,523\n337,580\nMarket risk weighted assets\n5,307\n5,790\n6,808\nOperational risk weighted assets\n46,626\n37,733\n37,618\nInterest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) risk weighted assets\n6,922\n7,245\n8,814\nTotal risk weighted assets\n416,961\n396,291\n390,820\nCapital ratios (%)7\nLevel 2 Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio\n11.4%\n11.5%\n11.4%\nLevel 2 Tier 1 capital ratio\n13.2%\n13.4%\n13.4%\nLevel 2 Total capital ratio\n15.3%\n15.3%\n15.2%\nLevel 1: Extended licensed Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio\n11.4%\n11.2%\n11.6%\nLevel 1: Extended licensed entity Tier 1 capital ratio\n13.4%\n13.2%\n13.6%\nLevel 1: Extended licensed entity Total capital ratio\n15.7%\n15.3%\n15.6%\nOther significant Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) or overseas bank subsidiary:\nANZ Bank New Zealand Limited – Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio\n10.8%\n11.4%\n11.1%\nANZ Bank New Zealand Limited - Tier 1 capital ratio\n13.6%\n14.6%\n14.4%\nANZ Bank New Zealand Limited - Total capital ratio\n13.6%\n14.6%\n14.4%\n6 Specialised Lending exposures subject to slotting approach are those where the main servicing and repayment is from the asset being financed, and includes specified commercial property development/investment lending, project finance and object finance.\n7 ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited’s capital ratios have been calculated in accordance with Reserve Bank of New Zealand prudential standards.\n21\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 Disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nCredit Risk Weighted Assets (CRWA)\nTotal CRWA increased $12.6 billion (3.6%) from March 2019 to $358.1 billion at September 2019. The increase was mainly attributable to Methodology Review changes with the implementation of the regulatory standard impacting derivative exposures, Standardised Approach to Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR), and an increase from APRA risk weight floors on New Zealand residential mortgages and farm lending exposures.\nMarket Risk, Operational Risk and IRRBB RWA\nIRRBB RWA decreased $0.3 billion (4.5%) due to an improvement in embedded gains, partially offset by an increase in Repricing and Yield Curve risk.\nThe Operational Risk RWA has increased $8.9 billion (23.6%) compared to March 2019 due to the update of Operational risk capital model parameters ($2.6 billion), and implementation of a regulatory capital overlay ($6.3 billion).\nTraded Market Risk RWA decreased $0.5 billion (8.3%) over the half year due to reduction in Stress VaR.\n22\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 Disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nChapter 5 – Credit risk\nTable 7\nCredit risk – General disclosures\nDefinition of credit risk\nCredit Risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from a counterparty failing to fulfil its credit obligations, or from a decrease in credit quality of a counterparty resulting in a loss in value.\nRegulatory approval to use the Advanced Internal Ratings-based approach\nANZ has been given approval by APRA to use the Advanced Internal Ratings (AIRB) based approach to credit risk, under APS 113 Capital Adequacy: Internal Ratings-based Approach to Credit Risk. As an AIRB bank, ANZ’s internal models generate the inputs into regulatory capital adequacy to determine the risk weighted exposure calculations for both on and off-balance sheet exposures, including undrawn portions of credit facilities, committed and contingent exposures and expected loss (EL) calculations.\nANZ’s internal models are used to generate three key risk components that serve as inputs to the IRB approach to credit risk:\nProbability of Default (PD) is an estimate of the level of the risk of borrower default • Exposure at Default (EAD) is defined as the expected facility exposure at the date of default • Loss Given Default (LGD) is an estimate of the potential economic loss on a credit exposure, incurred as a consequence of obligor default.\nThere are however several small portfolios (mainly retail and local corporates in Pacific, and local corporates in Asia) where ANZ applies the Standardised approach to credit risk, under APS 112 Capital Adequacy: Standardised Approach to Credit Risk.\nCredit risk management framework and policies\nANZ has a comprehensive framework to manage Wholesale Credit Risk. The framework is top down, being defined by credit principles and policies. Credit policies, requirements and procedures cover all aspects of the credit life cycle such as transaction structuring, risk grading, initial approval, ongoing management and problem debt management, as well as specialist policy topics.\nThe effectiveness of the credit risk management framework is assessed through various compliance and monitoring processes. These, together with portfolio selection and risk appetite setting, define and guide the credit process, organisation and staff.\nOrganisation\nThe Credit and Market Risk Committee (CMRC) is a senior executive level committee responsible for the oversight and control of credit, market, insurance and material financial risks across the ANZ Group. The Credit Rating System Oversight Committee (CRSOC) supports the CMRC, by providing oversight and control of the internal ratings system for credit risk in the wholesale and retail sectors, including credit model approvals and performance monitoring.\nThe primary responsibility for prudent and profitable management of credit risk assets and customer relationships rests with the business units. An independent credit risk management function is staffed by risk specialists. Independence is achieved by having all credit risk staff ultimately report to the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), even where they are embedded in business units. Risk performs key roles in portfolio management such as development and validation of credit risk measurement systems, loan asset quality reporting, and development of credit policies and requirements. In ANZ’s wholesale businesses, Risk also provides independent credit assessment and approval on lending decisions.\nThe authority to make credit decisions is delegated by the Board to the CEO who in turn delegates authority to the CRO. The CRO in turn delegates some of their credit discretion to individuals as part of a ‘cascade’ of authority from senior to the most junior credit officers. Within ANZ, credit approval for material wholesale lending is judgementally made on a ‘dual approval’ basis, jointly by the business writer in the business unit and the respective independent credit risk officer. Individuals must be suitably skilled and accredited in order to be granted and retain credit discretion. Credit discretions are reviewed on an annual basis, and may be varied based on the holder’s performance.\nProgrammed credit assessment typically covers retail and some small business lending, and refers to the automated assessment of credit applications using a combination of scoring (application and behavioural), policy rules and external credit reporting information. Where an application does not meet the automated assessment criteria it will be referred out for manual assessment, with assessors considering the decision tool recommendation.\n23\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 Disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nPortfolio direction and performance\nThe credit risk management framework contains several portfolio direction and performance tools which enable Risk to play a fundamental role in monitoring the direction and performance of the portfolio. These include:\nGroup and divisional level risk appetite strategies, business writing strategies and segment transaction guidelines are prepared by the businesses and set out appetite, planned portfolio growth, capital usage and risk/return profile, and also identify areas that may require attention to mitigate and improve risk management;\nRegular portfolio reviews; and\nExposure concentration limits, covering single customers, industries and cross border risk, to ensure a diversified portfolio.\nANZ uses portfolio monitoring and analysis tools, technologies and techniques to assist with portfolio risk assessment and management. These assist in:\nMonitoring, analysing and reporting ANZ’s credit risk profile and progress in meeting portfolio objectives;\nCalculating and reporting ANZ’s collectively assessed provision, economic capital, expected loss, regulatory risk weighted assets (RWA) and regulatory expected loss;\nAssessing impact of emerging issues, and conducting ad-hoc investigations and analysis;\nValidating rating/scoring tools and credit estimates; and\nOngoing review and refinement of ANZ's credit risk measurement and policy framework.\nCredit Risk Reporting\nCredit risk management information systems, reporting and analysis are managed centrally and at the divisional and business unit level.\nPeriodic reporting assists in analysing the effectiveness of strategies and processes identifying emerging issues and monitoring of portfolio trends by all levels of management and the Board.\nExamples of reports include EAD, portfolio mix, risk grade profiles and migrations, RWAs, large exposure reporting, credit watch and control lists, impaired assets and provisions.\nExposure at default\nEAD is defined as the expected facility exposure at the date of default. Unless otherwise stated, throughout this disclosure EAD represents credit exposure net of offsets for credit risk mitigation such as guarantees, credit derivatives, netting and financial collateral.\nPast due facilities\nFacilities where a contractual payment has not been met or the customer is outside of contractual arrangements for a material length of time are deemed past due. Past due facilities include those operating in excess of approved arrangements or where scheduled repayments are outstanding, but do not include impaired assets.\nImpaired assets8\nA facility for which there is doubt about timely payment of principal, interest and fees being achieved and / or a material credit obligation is 90 days or more past due and is not well secured. It includes all problem assets, off- balance sheet exposures (including derivatives) and assets brought to ANZ’s balance sheet through the enforcement of security. Impaired derivatives have a credit valuation adjustment, which is a market assessment of the credit risk of the relevant counterparties.\nRestructured items\nRestructured items comprise facilities in which the original contractual terms have been modified for reasons related to the financial difficulties of the customer. Restructuring may consist of reduction of interest, principal or other payments legally due, or an extension in maturity materially beyond those typically offered to new facilities with similar risk.\n8 The definition of Impaired Assets for accounting purposes is a default occurs when there are indicators that a debtor is unlikely to fully satisfy contractual credit obligations to the Group, or the exposure is 90 days past due. Financial assets, including those that are well secured, are considered credit impaired for financial reporting purposes when they are in default.\n24\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 Disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nCollectively Assessed Provisions for Credit Impairment\nCollectively assessed provisions for credit impairment represent the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculated in accordance with AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9) which commenced 1 October 2018. These incorporate forward looking information and do not require an actual loss event to have occurred for an impairment provision to be recognised.\nUnder AASB 9, ECL is either measured over 12 months or the expected lifetime of the financial asset, depending on the credit deterioration since origination, according to the following three-stage approach:\nStage 1: At the origination of a financial asset, and where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, a provision equivalent to 12 months ECL is recognised. For instruments with a remaining maturity of less than 12 months, a provision calculated on the remaining term of the maturity is recognised.\nStage 2: Where there has been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since origination, a provision equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised.\nStage 3: Where there is objective evidence of impairment, a provision equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised.\nIn determining what constitutes a SICR, ANZ considers both qualitative and quantitative information, including CCR at origination and at the reporting date.\nECL is calculated as the product of PD, LGD and EAD at a facility level, discounted for incorporating the effect of time value of money. These credit risk factors are adjusted for current and forward looking information through the use of macro-economic variables in the model.\nIndividually Assessed Provisions for Credit Impairment\nIndividually assessed provisions for credit impairment are calculated in accordance with AASB 9. They are assessed on a case-by-case basis for all individually managed impaired assets taking into consideration factors such as the realisable value of security (or other credit mitigants), the likely return available upon liquidation or bankruptcy, legal uncertainties, estimated costs involved in recovery, the market price of the exposure in secondary markets and the amount and timing of expected receipts and recoveries.\nWrite-offs\nFacilities are written off against the related provision for impairment when they are assessed as partially or fully uncollectable, and after proceeds from the realisation of any collateral have been received. Where individually assessed provisions recognised in previous periods have subsequently decreased or are no longer required, such impairment losses are reversed in the current period income statement.\nDefinition of default\nANZ uses the following definition of default:\nANZ considers that the customer is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse to actions such as realising security, or\n\nthe customer is at least 90 days past due on a credit obligation, or\n\nthe customer’s overdraft or other revolving facility(ies) have been continuously outside approved limits for 90 or more consecutive days.\nSpecific Provision and General Reserve for Credit Losses\nDue to definitional differences, there is a difference in the split between ANZ’s individually assessed provision and collectively assessed provision for accounting purposes and the specific provision and general reserve for credit losses (GRCL) for regulatory purposes. This does not impact total provisions, and essentially relates to the classification of collectively assessed provisions on defaulted accounts. The disclosures in this document are based on individually assessed provision and collectively assessed provision, for ease of comparison with other published results.\nAPRA has flagged that the adoption of the forward looking ECL approach means that a GRCL will no longer be required. This is likely to take effect at the commencement of the revised APS 220 prudential standard expected in mid 2020.\nExposure at Default in Table 7 represents credit exposure net of offsets for credit risk mitigation such as guarantees, credit derivatives, netting and financial collateral. It includes Advanced IRB, Specialised Lending and Standardised exposures, and excludes Securitisation, Equities or Other Assets exposures.\n25\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 Disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nTable

Under the Standardised approach, exposures are mapped to several regulatory risk weights, mainly based on the type of counterparty and its external rating. For these counterparties, external ratings by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service are used as inputs into the RWA calculation. As described in the section on the ANZ rating system, ANZ has mapped its master scale to the grading of these two External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs).\nANZ applies its full normal risk measurement and management framework to these segments for internal management purposes, such as for economic capital. Standardised segments will be migrated to AIRB if they reach a volume that generates sufficient data for development of advanced internal models.\nANZ has not applied the Foundation IRB approach to any portfolios.\nThe ANZ rating system\nAs an AIRB bank, ANZ’s internal models generate the inputs into regulatory capital adequacy to determine the risk weighted exposure calculations for both on and off-balance sheet exposures, including undrawn portions of credit facilities, committed and contingent exposures and EL calculations. ANZ’s internal models are used to generate the three key risk components that serve as inputs to the IRB approach to credit risk:\nPD is an estimate of the level of the risk of borrower default. Borrower ratings are derived by way of rating models used both at loan origination and for ongoing monitoring.\nEAD is defined as the expected facility exposure at the date of default.\nLGD is an estimate of the potential economic loss on a credit exposure, incurred as a consequence of obligor default and expressed as a percentage of the facility’s EAD. ANZ’s LGD also includes recognition of the different legal and insolvency regimes in different countries, where this has been shown to influence recovery outcomes.\n28 The IRB asset classification of investment banks is Corporate, rather than Bank.\n29 Since 2009, APRA has agreed that some large, well-diversified commercial property exposures may be treated as corporate exposures, in line with the original Basel Committee’s definition of Specialised Lending.\n30 ANZ uses an internal assessment which is mapped to the appropriate Supervisory Slot.\n41\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nEffective maturity is also calculated as an input to the risk weighted exposure calculation for bank, sovereign and corporate IRB asset classes.\nANZ’s rating system has two separate and distinct dimensions that:\nMeasure the PD, which is expressed by the Customer Credit Rating (CCR), reflecting the ability to service and repay debt.\nMeasure the LGD as expressed by the Security Indicator (SI) ranging from A to G. The SI is calculated by reference to the percentage of a loan covered by security which can be realised in the event of default. This calculation uses standard ratios to adjust the current market value of collateral items to allow for historical realisation outcomes. The security-related SIs are supplemented with a range of other SIs which cover such factors as cash cover, mezzanine finance, intra-group guarantees and sovereign backing as ANZ’s LGD research indicates that these transaction characteristics have different recovery outcomes. ANZ’s LGD also includes recognition of the different legal and insolvency regimes in different countries, where this has been shown to influence recovery outcomes. ANZ’s corporate PD master scale is APRA approved, and is made up of 27 rating grades. Each level/grade is separately defined and has a range of default probabilities attached to it. The PD master scale enables ANZ’s rating system to be mapped to the grading’s of external rating agencies, using the PD as a common element after ensuring that default definitions and other key attributes are aligned.\nThe following table demonstrates this alignment (for one year PDs):\nANZ CCR\nMoody’s\nStandard & Poor’s\nPD Range\n0+ to 1-\nAaa to Aa3\nAAA to AA-\n0.0000 - 0.0346%\n2+ to 3+\nA1 to Baa1\nA+ to BBB+\n0.0347 - 0.1636%\n3= to 4+\nBaa2 to > Baa3\nBBB to > BB+\n0.1637 - 0.4004%\n4= to 6=\nBa1 to B1\nBB+ to B+\n0.4005 – 2.7550%\n6- to 7=\nB2 to B3\nB to B-\n2.7551 – 9.7980%\n7- to 8+ 8=\nCaa Ca, C\nCCC CC, C\n9.7981 – 27.1109% 27.1110 – 99.9999%\n8-, 9 and 10\nDefault\nDefault\n100%\nIn the retail asset classes, most facilities utilise credit rating scores. The scores are calibrated to PDs, and used to allocate exposures to homogenous pools, along with LGD and EAD.\nUse of internal estimates other than for regulatory capital purposes\nANZ’s rating system is a fundamental part of credit management and plays a key role in:\nLending discretions,\nMinimum origination standards,\nConcentration limits,\nPortfolio reporting,\nCustomer profitability measurement,\nCollectively assessed provision measurement,\nManagement of deteriorating customers (where certain CCR/SI combinations trigger increasing scrutiny), and\nPricing decisions.\n42\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nPD, LGD and EAD are used in the calculation of capital and in the collectively assessed provisioning process. Regulatory and economic capital are calculated from the same data sources and starting from the same basis, however there are some differences between the factors used because several aspects of ANZ’s rating system are adjusted in accordance with APRA requirements for regulatory capital purposes. The most significant of these adjustments are the use for regulatory capital purposes of downturn LGDs; the imposition of a 20% LGD floor for exposures secured by Australian residential real estate and the mandatory use of the supervisory slotting approach for project finance and most commercial real estate exposures.\nControls surrounding the ratings system\nANZ’s rating system and credit risk estimates are governed by the Board Risk Committee and several executive management committees, and are underpinned by a comprehensive framework of controls that operate throughout ANZ. All policies, methodologies, model designs, model reviews, validations, responsibilities, systems and processes supporting the ratings systems are documented, and subject to review by Global Internal Audit.\nThe design, build and implementation of credit rating models resides with a specialist Group-level team. Credit rating models are owned by central Risk teams. The use (including overrides) and performance of credit rating models is monitored by the relevant business and their counterparts in Risk, and validated regularly by a separate specialist Group-level function. This cycle of design, build, implementation, monitoring and validation is overseen by the CRSOC, and informs the need for new models or recalibration of existing models.\nGroup Credit Assurance (within Global Internal Audit) provides third line independent credit related assurance activities, including providing an independent assessment of both the asset quality in the portfolio and the quality of credit decision making. It also assesses management controls from a “top down” portfolio oversight perspective as well as credit risk processes from a “bottom up” perspective based on individual customer file reviews.\nRisk grades are an integral part of reporting to the Board and executives.\nIn addition, the use of the rating system’s outputs in key business unit performance measures in processes such as provisioning and the allocation of capital ensure that the rating system receives robust input from the business units, not just the specialist modelling teams.\nRating process by asset class\nBuilding reliable and accurate rating tools requires balancing of many factors including data availability (external data may be used in some circumstances, where it is relevant), the size of the segment (the more customers within the segment, the more likely that statistically reliable models can be built), and the need to be able to validate the model. Rating tool approaches include:\nStatistical models producing a PD or a LGD, which are developed from internal or external data on defaults.\nStatistical models producing an internal rating, which involve calibrating ANZ’s models to external rating data where data on defaults is insufficient for statistical purposes (such as banks).\nHybrid statistical and expert models producing an internal rating, which use a mixture of default data and expert input.\nExpert models/processes that produce an internal rating, including external rating agency replication models.\nOngoing data collection and testing processes ensure enhanced or new models are introduced as required to maintain and improve the accuracy and reliability of rating processes.\n43\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nRegardless of what credit risk rating tool is used, lending staff rating a customer are required to review the model- generated PD (or CCR) and take into account any out-of-model factors or policy overlays to decide whether or not to override the model rating. Overrides of a rating model to a better rating require approval from the independent credit risk function. The significance of the model for risk grading varies with the customer segment: models will dominate risk grading of homogenous, simple and data-rich segments such as in Retail, however for complex, specialised business segments expert knowledge and the highly customised nature of transactions will influence the rating outcome.\nThe following table summarises the types of internal rating approaches used in ANZ:\nIRB Asset Class\nBorrower type\nRating Approach\nCorporate\nCorporations, partnerships or proprietorships that do not fit into any other asset class\nMainly statistical models Some use of expert models and policy processes\nSovereign\nCentral governments Central banks Certain multilateral development banks Australian state governments\nExternal rating and expert judgement\nBank\nBanks In Australia only, other ADIs incorporated in Australia\nStatistically-based models Review of all relevant and material information including external ratings\nResidential Mortgages\nExposures secured by residential property\nStatistical models\nQualifying Revolving Retail\nConsumer credit cards <$100,000 limit\nStatistical models\nOther Retail\nSmall business lending Other lending to consumers\nStatistical models\nSpecialised Lending\nIncome Producing Real Estate Project finance Object finance\nExpert models/Supervisory Slotting 31\nFor the Retail Basel asset class (Residential Mortgages, Qualifying Revolving Retail and Other Retail Exposures) the large number of relatively homogenous exposures enable the development of statistically robust application scoring models for use at origination and behavioural scoring for ongoing management. As noted above, the scores are calibrated to PD, and used to allocate exposures to homogenous pools, along with LGD and EAD.\nEstimation of LGD and EAD\nANZ’s LGD modelling takes into account data on secured recovery, unsecured recovery rates and debt seniority, geography and internal management costs from several major data sources. Internal data is used as the basis for LGD estimation in the retail asset class, and is supplemented by external data for the corporate asset class. Given the scarcity of internal data for Bank and Sovereign Basel asset classes, LGD modelling for these classes is primarily based on external data.\nEAD represents the expected facility exposure at the date of default, including an estimate of additional drawings prior to default, as well as post-default drawings that were legally committed to prior to default.\n31 Specialised Lending exposures are rated with internal rating tools to produce a PD and LGD. These are used in internal processes, but not for regulatory capital purposes where the exposures are mapped to Supervisory Slots.\n44\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nTable 9(d): Non Retail Exposure at Default subject to Advanced Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach32 33 34\nSep 19\nAAA < A+ $M\nA+ < BBB $M\nBBB < BB+ $M\nBB+ < B+ $M\nB+ < CCC $M\nCCC $M\nDefault $M\nTotal $M\nExposure at Default\nCorporate\n28,676\n83,292\n88,656\n56,847\n14,923\n2,151\n2,054\n276,599\nSovereign\n121,380\n26,556\n2,315\n898\n1,768\n22\n1\n152,940\nBank\n17,972\n31,295\n4,321\n1,529\n24\n4\n\n55,145\nTotal\n168,028\n141,143\n95,292\n59,274\n16,715\n2,177\n2,055\n484,684\n% of Total\n34.8%\n29.1%\n19.7%\n12.2%\n3.4%\n0.4%\n0.4%\n100.0%\nUndrawn commitments (included in above)\nCorporate\n7,689\n32,168\n22,657\n8,018\n1,620\n205\n58\n72,415\nSovereign\n1,194\n54\n1\n10\n4\n\n\n1,263\nBank\n47\n442\n28\n\n2\n\n\n519\nTotal\n8,930\n32,664\n22,686\n8,028\n1,626\n205\n58\n74,197\nAverage Exposure at Default\nCorporate\n12.281\n10.124\n1.790\n0.698\n0.133\n0.217\n0.730\n1.039\nSovereign\n166.960\n491.771\n38.586\n11.662\n21.047\n5.615\n0.204\n151.426\nBank\n6.600\n6.072\n4.163\n4.444\n0.654\n0.240\n\n5.922\nExposure-weighted average Loss Given Default (%)\nCorporate\n54.6%\n56.5%\n46.8%\n36.8%\n33.8%\n39.2%\n41.2%\n47.7%\nSovereign\n5.1%\n12.9%\n40.8%\n42.5%\n51.4%\n58.3%\n5.6%\n7.7%\nBank\n63.9%\n61.7%\n64.3%\n68.5%\n67.7%\n72.5%\n\n62.8%\nExposure-weighted average risk weight (%)\nCorporate\n17.1%\n32.9%\n52.9%\n62.6%\n88.3%\n190.5%\n108.0%\n48.5%\nSovereign\n0.9%\n3.3%\n42.0%\n80.8%\n138.1%\n318.9%\n\n4.1%\nBank\n19.5%\n25.3%\n63.7%\n113.7%\n183.3%\n391.1%\n\n29.0%\n32 In accordance with APS 330, EAD in Table 9(d) includes Advanced IRB exposures and excludes Specialised Lending, Standardised, Securitisation, Equities or Other Assets exposures.

It covers the PD, EAD and LGD estimates for the IRB portfolios.\nEstimated PD and LGD for Specialised Lending exposures have not been provided, since APRA requires the use of supervisory slotting for Regulatory EL calculations. Actual PD, EAD ratio, Estimated LGD and Actual LGD for Sovereign exposures have not been provided, since there were no Sovereign defaults observed in ANZ Sovereign exposures for the observation period.\nWholesale Portfolios The estimated PD is based on the average of the internally estimated long-run PD’s for obligors that are not in default at the beginning of each financial year over the period of observation being 2009 to 2018. The actual PD is based on the number of defaulted obligors up to August 2019 compared to the total number of obligors measured.\nThe EAD ratio compares internally estimated EAD prior to default to realised EAD for defaulted obligors over the 10 years of observation being 2009 to August 2019. A ratio greater than 1.0 signifies that on average, the actual defaulted exposures are lower than the estimated exposures at the time of default.\nThe estimated LGD is the downturn LGD for accounts that defaulted at the beginning of each year during the observation period being 2009 to September 2017. The actual LGD is based on the average realised losses over the period for the accounts observed at the beginning and defaulted during the observation period. For non-retail portfolios, the estimated and actual LGDs are based on accounts that defaulted up to September 2017. Defaults occurring after September 2017 have been excluded from the analysis to allow sufficient time for workout period. Actual LGD for defaults where workouts were not finalised have been estimated to approximate the final actual loss.\nRetail Portfolios The estimated PD is based on the average of the internally estimated long-run PD’s for obligors that are not in default at the beginning of each financial year over the period of observation being 2014 to 2018. The actual PD is based on the number of defaulted obligors up to March 2019 compared to the total number of obligors measured.\nThe EAD ratio compares internally estimated EAD prior to default to realised EAD for defaulted obligors over the period of observation being 2014 to 2018.

ANZ’s credit risk modelling teams use historical internal loss data and other relevant external data to assist in determining the discount that each type would be expected to incur in a forced sale. The discounted value is used in the determination of the SI.\nPolicies and processes for collateral valuation and management\nANZ has well established policies, requirements and processes around collateral valuation and management, that are reviewed regularly. The concepts of legal enforceability, certainty and current valuation are central to collateral management.\nIn order to achieve legal enforceability and certainty, ANZ uses standard collateral instruments or has specific documentation drawn up by external legal advisers, and where applicable, security interests are registered. The use of collateral management systems also provides certainty that the collateral has been properly taken, registered and stored.\nIn order to rely on the valuation of collateral assets, ANZ has developed comprehensive rules around acceptable types of valuations (including who may value an asset), the frequency of revaluations and standard extension ratios for typical asset types. Upon receipt of a new valuation in wholesale lending, the information is used to recalculate the SI (or to reassess the adequacy of the provision, in the case of an impaired asset), thereby ensuring that the exposure has an updated LGD attached to it for risk quantification purposes.\nGuarantee support\nWithin wholesale lending, guarantee support for lending proposals are an integral component in transaction structuring for ANZ. The guarantee of a financially stronger party can help improve the PD of a transaction through its explicit support of the weaker rated borrower.\nGuarantees that are recognised for risk rating purposes may be provided by parties that include associated entities, banks, sovereigns or individuals. Credit requirements provide threshold parameters to determine acceptable counterparties in achieving risk grade enhancement of the transaction.\nThe suitability of the guarantor is determined by risk rating that guarantor. Not all guarantees or guarantors are recognised for risk grading purposes.\nUse of credit derivatives for risk mitigation\nANZ uses purchased credit derivatives to mitigate credit risk by lowering exposures to reference entities that generate high concentration risk exposures or to improve risk return performance. Only certain credit derivatives such as credit default swaps (CDS) are recognised for risk mitigation purposes in the determination of regulatory capital. Standard, legally enforceable documentation applies.\nFor regulatory capital purposes, ANZ only recognises protection using credit derivatives where they meet several policy and regulatory requirements around the strength of the protection offered such as being irrevocable.\n35 For some products, the collateral provided is fundamental to its structuring so is not strictly the secondary source of repayment. For example, lending secured by trade receivables is typically repaid by the collection of those receivables.\n51\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nA CDS may only be transacted with banks and non-bank financial institutions that have been credit assessed and approved by a designated specialist credit officer. All parties must meet minimum credit standards and be allocated a related credit limit. In the event that the creditworthiness of a credit protection provider falls below the minimum required to provide effective protection, the protection is no longer recognised as an effective risk mitigant for regulatory purposes.\nThe use of netting\nNetting is a form of credit risk mitigation in that it reduces EAD, by offsetting a customer’s positive and negative balances with ANZ.\nIn order to apply on-balance sheet netting, the arrangement must be specifically documented with the customer and meet a number of legally enforceable requirements.\nNetting is also used where the credit exposure arises from off-balance sheet market related transactions. For close- out netting to be utilised with counterparties, a legally enforceable eligible netting agreement in an acceptable jurisdiction must be in place. This means that each transaction is aggregated into a single net amount and transactions are netted to arrive at a single overall sum.\nTransaction structuring to mitigate credit risk\nBesides collateral, guarantee support and derivatives described above, credit risk mitigation can also be furthered by prudent transaction structuring. For example, the risk in project finance lending can be mitigated by lending covenants, loan syndication and political risk insurance.\nConcentrations of credit risk mitigation\nTaking collateral raises the possibility that ANZ may inadvertently increase its risk by becoming exposed to collateral concentrations. For example, in the same way that an over-exposure to a particular industry may mean that a bank is more sensitive to the fortunes of that industry, an over-exposure to a particular collateral asset type may make ANZ more sensitive to the performance of that asset type.\nANZ does not believe that it has any material concentrations of collateral types, given the well diversified nature of its portfolio and conservative asset extension ratios.\n52\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nTable 10(b): Credit risk mitigation on Standardised approach portfolios – collateral 36\nSep 19\nExposure $M\nEligible Financial Collateral $M\nOther Eligible Collateral $M\n% Coverage\nStandardised approach\nCorporate\n12,998\n7,389\n\n56.8%\nResidential Mortgage\n445\n\n\n0.0%\nOther Retail\n49\n\n\n0.0%\nTotal\n13,492\n7,389\n\n54.8%\nMar 19\nExposure $M\nEligible Financial Collateral $M\nOther Eligible Collateral $M\n% Coverage\nStandardised approach\nCorporate\n13,519\n7,119\n2,254\n69.3%\nResidential Mortgage\n716\n\n\n0.0%\nOther Retail\n80\n\n\n0.0%\nTotal\n14,315\n7,119\n2,254\n65.5%\nSep 18\nExposure $M\nEligible Financial Collateral $M\nOther Eligible Collateral $M\n% Coverage\nStandardised approach\nCorporate\n15,064\n5,486\n2,585\n53.6%\nResidential Mortgage\n704\n\n\n0.0%\nOther Retail\n87\n\n\n0.0%\nTotal\n15,855\n5,486\n2,585\n50.9%\n36 Eligible Collateral could include cash collateral (cash, certificates deposits and bank bills issued by the lending ADI), gold bullion and highly rated debt securities.\n53\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nTable 10(c): Credit risk mitigation – guarantees and credit derivatives\nSep 19\nExposure $M\nExposures covered by Guarantees $M\nAdvanced IRB\nCorporate (incl.

The amount at risk may change over time as a function of the underlying market parameters up to the positive value of the contract in favour of ANZ.\nCounterparty credit risk is present in market instruments (derivatives and forward contracts), and comprises:\nSettlement risk, which arises where one party makes payment or delivers value in the expectation but without certainty that the counterparty will perform the corresponding obligation in a bilateral contract at settlement date.\nMarket replacement risk (pre-settlement risk), which is the risk that a counterparty will default during the life of a derivative contract and that a loss will be incurred in covering the position.\nANZ transacts market instruments with the following counterparties:\nEnd users – would typically use Over the Counter (OTC) derivative instruments provided by ANZ to manage price movement risk associated with their core business activity.\nProfessional counterparties – ANZ may hedge price movement risks by entering into transactions with professional counterparties that conduct two way (buy and sell) business.\nCounterparty credit risk requires a different method to calculate exposure at default because actual and potential market movements impact ANZ’s exposure or replacement cost over the life of derivative contracts. The markets covered by this treatment include the derivative activities associated with interest rate, foreign exchange, CDS, equity, commodity and repurchase agreement (repo) products.\nCounterparty credit risk governance\nANZ’s counterparty credit risk management is governed by its credit principles, policies and procedures. The Markets Risk function is responsible for determining the counterparty credit risk exposure methodology applied to market instruments, in the framework for counterparty credit limit management, measurement and reporting.\nThe counterparty credit risk associated with derivative transactions is governed by credit limit setting consistent with all credit exposures to the ANZ Group. Counterparty credit limits are approved by the appropriate credit delegation holders.\nCounterparty credit risk measurement and reporting\nThe approach to measure counterparty credit risk exposure is based on internal models. These measures are referred to as potential credit risk exposure (PCRE) and potential future exposure (PFE) and measure the maximum credit exposure of derivative transactions at future time points to ANZ. PFE is measured at the 97.5th percentile at future pre-described time points, and PCRE is a 97.5th percentile averaged over time points.\nPCRE factors recognise that prices may change over the remaining period to maturity, and that risk decreases as the contract’s remaining term to maturity decreases. In general terms PCRE is calculated by applying a risk weighting or volatility factor to the face value of the notional principal of individual trades.\nPFE simulates relevant risk factors in a portfolio by taking into account the relevant volatilities and correlations calibrated to historical market data.\n56\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nCredit valuation adjustment (CVA)\nOver the life of a derivative instrument, ANZ uses a CVA model to adjust fair value to take into account the impact of counterparty credit quality. The methodology calculates the present value of expected losses over the life of the financial instrument as a function of PD, LGD, and expected credit risk exposure.\nAPRA requires banks, including ANZ, to hold additional risk based capital to cover the risk of CVA mark to market losses associated with deterioration in counterparty credit worthiness when entering into derivatives transactions.\nWrong way risk\nANZ’s management of counterparty credit risk also considers the possibility of wrong way risk, which emerges when PD is adversely correlated with counterparty credit risk exposures.\nCounterparty credit risk mitigation and credit enhancements\nANZ’s primary tools to mitigate counterparty credit risk include:\nA bilateral netting master agreement (e.g. by International Swaps and Derivatives Association – (ISDA)) allowing close-out netting of exposures in a portfolio with offsetting contracts, with a single net payment with the same legal counterparty.\nUse of collateral agreements in some transactions based on standard market documentation (i.e. ISDA master agreement with credit support annex or CSA) that governs the amount of collateral required to be posted or received by ANZ throughout the life of the contract. Reasons for requiring collateral include:\n\nVariation Margin – reflects the current mark-to-market exposure.\n\nInitial Margin – covers the future potential exposure that could arise from future changes in market value\n\nSince March 2017, APRA’s CPS 226 “Margining and risk mitigation for non-centrally cleared derivatives” has mandated Variation Margin and Initial Margin arrangements between covered entities, subject to trading volume thresholds. The operation of collateral agreements falls under a policy which establishes the control framework designed to ensure a robust and globally consistent approach to the management of collateralised exposures, as well as compliance with CPS 226 obligations.\n\nAPRA’s CPS 226 also requires ADI’s to apply risk mitigation practices for un-cleared derivatives between covered counterparties in the areas of trading relationship documentation, trade confirmation, portfolio reconciliation, portfolio compression, valuation processes and dispute resolution processes.\nUse of right to break clauses in master agreements or in trade confirmation to reduce term of long dated derivative trades.\n\nIndependent limit setting, credit exposure control, monitoring and reporting of excesses against approved credit limits.\nAdditional termination triggers (close out of exposure) such as credit rating downgrade clauses and change in ownership clauses included in documentation.\nLinking covenants and events of default in existing loan facility agreements to master agreements.\nSettlement through Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) to eliminate settlement risk for foreign exchange transactions with CLS members.\nClearing certain derivative transactions through central counterparties clearing houses.\nA specific risk appetite for Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) exposures, approved by the Board.\nDesign and implementation of limit framework and monitoring of CVA exposures, to ensure CVA exposure is within Risk appetite.\nUse of credit derivatives and market instruments to hedge CVA.\nIn the event of a downgrading of ANZ’s rating by one notch from AA- to A+, as at 30 September 2019, ANZ would not be required to lodge additional collateral with its counterparties.\n57\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nTable 11(b): Counterparty credit risk – net derivative credit exposure\nSep 19\nMar 19\nSep 18\n$M\n$M\n$M\nGross positive fair value of contracts 37\n120,667\n79,376\n68,426\nNetting benefits\n(106,003)\n(66,767)\n(54,251)\nNetted current credit exposure\n14,664\n12,609\n14,175\nCollateral held\n(6,277)\n(4,566)\n(5,507)\nNet derivatives credit exposure\n8,387\n8,043\n8,668\nCounterparty credit risk exposure - by portfolio type\nSep 19\nSep 19\nMar 19\nPortfolio Type\n$M\n$M\n$M\nCorporate\n23,276\n14,096\n14,286\nSovereign\n2,863\n1,816\n1,478\nBank\n16,733\n14,853\n15,199\nQualifying Central Counterparties\n9,348\n12,530\n11,402\nSpecialised Lending\n1,496\n629\n387\nTotal exposures\n53,716\n43,924\n42,752\nNotional Value of Credit Derivative Hedges\nSep 19\nMar 19\nSep 18\nProduct Type\n$M\n$M\n$M\nCredit Default Swaps\n344\n349\n342\nInterest Rate Swaps\n\n\n\nCurrency Swaps\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\nTotal exposures\n344\n349\n342\n37 The half on half increase is driven by the mark to market position, interest rate and foreign exchange market movements over the period.\n58\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nTable 11(c): Counterparty credit risk exposure – credit derivative transactions\nProtection Bought $M\nCredit derivative products used for own credit portfolio\nCredit default swaps\n7,091\nTotal notional value\n7,091\nCredit derivative products used for intermediation\nCredit default swaps\n344\nTotal return swaps\n\nTotal notional value\n344\nTotal credit derivative notional value\n7,435\nProtection Bought $M\nCredit derivative products used for own credit portfolio\nCredit default swaps\n4,451\nTotal notional value\n4,451\nCredit derivative products used for intermediation\nCredit default swaps\n349\nTotal return swaps\n\nTotal notional value\n349\nTotal credit derivative notional value\n4,800\nProtection Bought $M\nCredit derivative products used for own credit portfolio\nCredit default swaps\n2,347\nTotal notional value\n2,347\nCredit derivative products used for intermediation\nCredit default swaps\n342\nTotal return swaps\n\nTotal notional value\n342\nTotal credit derivative notional value\n2,689\n59\nSeptember 2019\nSep 19\nProtection Sold $M\nTotal $M\n4,940\n12,031\n4,940\n12,031\n344\n688\n\n\n344\n688\n5,284\n12,719\nMar 19\nProtection Sold $M\nTotal $M\n2,702\n7,153\n2,702\n7,153\n349\n698\n\n\n349\n698\n3,051\n7,851\nSep 18\nProtection Sold $M\nTotal $M\n1,794\n4,141\n1,794\n4,141\n342\n684\n\n\n342\n684\n2,136\n4,825\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nChapter 6 – Securitisation\nTable 12\nSecuritisation disclosures\nDefinition of securitisation\nA securitisation is a financial structure where the cash flow from a pool of assets is used to service obligations to at least two different tranches or classes of creditors, typically holders of debt securities, with each class or tranche reflecting a different degree of credit risk. This stratification of credit risk means that one class of creditors is entitled to receive payments from the pool before another class.\nSecuritisation of ANZ originated assets\nSecuritisations may be categorised as:\nTraditional securitisations, where legal ownership of the underlying asset pool is transferred to investors, with principal and interest paid from realisation of or regular cash flows from the assets. The Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) assets are insulated from bankruptcy of the seller or servicer.\nSynthetic securitisations, where credit risk is transferred to a third party but legal ownership of the underlying\nassets remain with the originator e.g. by using credit derivatives or guarantees.\nCovered bond transactions, whereby bonds issued by ANZ are secured by assets held in a special purpose vehicle, are not securitisation exposures.\nANZ adopts securitisation as a funding, capital and liquidity management tool using assets it has originated. This may involve the transfer of credit risk i.e. may provide regulatory capital relief. ANZ also operates a self-securitisation program, backed by a pool of residential mortgages, which forms part of the Bank’s contingent liquidity arrangements.\nFor these securitisation programs, ANZ will undertake roles including as the originator, sponsor, servicer and trust manager. ANZ may retain an exposure to these securitisation programs (including as facility provider and swap provider), consistent with the roles described below in ‘Third Party Securitisation Activities’ and facilities provided as described below in ‘Risk Management’.\nThird Party Securitisation Activities\nANZ’s involvement with securitisation of third-party originated assets, including residential mortgages, auto and equipment loans and trade receivables, comprises of:\nProvision of facilities – this may include providing facilities to securitisation vehicles in the form of funding facility provider and interest rate swap provider. Funding may be provided via an ANZ-sponsored securitisation vehicle which is consolidated onto the Bank’s financial statements, to certain clients wishing to access securitisation.\nServices to securitisation programs may include structuring and arranging services and acting as bond manager.\n\nInvestment in securities – ANZ may purchase notes issued by securitisation programs.\nFor any assets ANZ has securitised or for SPVs that ANZ sponsors, any role provided by ANZ or its subsidiaries is subject to market based terms and conditions, and ANZ’s normal approval and review processes. Further, any securitisation exposures retained by ANZ or its affiliated entities are subject to ANZ’s normal approval and review processes as well as satisfying the requirements under APS 120: Securitisation.\nGovernance and Risk Management\nSimilar to other exposures, securitisation exposures are subject to credit, market, operational liquidity and compliance risks. Governance of securitisation activities is managed in accordance with ANZ’s established risk management framework, including the credit risk and market risk frameworks described in Chapters 5 and 7. Roles and responsibilities are clearly outlined in the Bank’s policies and procedures, including:\nAppropriate risk management systems to identify, measure, monitor and manage the risks arising from its\ninvolvement in securitisation exposures;\n\nImpact of ANZ’s involvement in securitisation exposures on its risk profile; and\n60\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nHow ANZ ensures that it does not provide any implicit support to securitisations with ANZ originated assets.\nFunding third party originated exposures and investment in securities are via balance sheet funded arrangements where such arrangements satisfy ANZ’s credit, due diligence and other business requirements.\nMany functions within ANZ are involved in securitisation activities given the range of activities undertaken and risks that need to be managed. For origination and structuring of securitisation transactions, ANZ has a specialist securitisation team with independent Risk personnel overseeing operations. Credit decisions require joint approval by Risk business unit and respective independent credit risk officer. The securitisation team must be involved in all non- trading securitisation transactions across ANZ, which ensures consistent expert treatment. Where ANZ invests in instruments issued by securitisation programs, the relevant business unit manages these exposures until the securitisation exposures are repaid in full or sold.\nAll facilities provided to our investments in securitisation programs (across both the banking and trading books) undergo initial and ongoing due diligence requirements as outlined by APRA. This includes analysing the structure of the transaction and monitoring performance of the underlying assets of the transaction. In addition, such securitisation exposures are formally reviewed at least annually with credit discretions being exercised.\nRisk reporting of securitisation exposures\nCredit risk management information systems, reporting and analysis are managed centrally for all securitisation exposures. In addition to the formal credit review process for ANZ’s securitisation exposures, internal reporting to the appropriate Risk and management functions provides oversight at the portfolio level. These reports include securitisation program performance, EAD, portfolio mix, and RWA.\nThe use and treatment of Credit Risk Mitigation (CRM) techniques with respect to securitisation exposures is assessed on a case-by-case basis in a manner consistent with the bank-wide CRM methodology 38.\nRegulatory capital approaches\nFor securitisation exposures held in ANZ’s banking book39, ANZ adopts a Standardised approach (as outlined in APS 120: Securitisation) to determine the credit risk regulatory capital charge via a hierarchy of approaches.\nThe primary rating approach is the External Ratings Based Approach (ERBA). For externally rated securitisation exposures that satisfy the operational requirements for external credit assessments, ANZ calculates credit risk regulatory capital based upon the ratings assigned by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Services and/or Fitch Ratings as appropriate, seniority of the securitisation exposure and the tenor of the securitisation exposure.\nIf ERBA is not applicable, ANZ adopts the Supervisory Formula Approach (SFA) for securitisation exposures. In this case, the credit risk regulatory capital calculation takes into account the type and performance of the underlying assets of the securitisation and the credit support provided to the securitisation exposure.\nIn relation to securitisation of ANZ originated assets, where:\n\nthe significant credit risk transfer requirements have been satisfied under APS 120, ANZ is not required to hold credit risk regulatory capital for the underlying assets of the securitisation, however credit risk regulatory capital is calculated for the facilities provided to the securitisation;\n\nin absence of significant credit risk transfer being satisfied under APS 120, ANZ holds credit risk regulatory capital for the underlying assets of the securitisation however the credit risk regulatory capital for facilities provided to the securitisation is not calculated.\nChapter 6 outlines regulatory capital treatment for securitisation exposures held in ANZ’s trading book. In addition, the operational requirements for the recognition of external credit assessments outlined in APS 120 also apply to these exposures.\n38 For example, various types of analysis including quantitative analysis of credit enhancements are performed for non-externally rated transactions. Factors such as geography, facility/transaction type and ANZ’s role will determine the applicable CRM techniques to apply. 39\nExposures are classified into either the trading book or the banking book. In general terms, the trading book consists of positions in financial instruments and commodities held with trading intent or in order to hedge other elements of the trading book, and the banking book contains all other exposures. Banking book exposures are typically held to maturity, in contrast to the shorter term, trading nature of the trading book.\n61\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nAccounting policies\nA key consideration in determining the treatment of transactions involving ANZ assets is whether the securitisation special purpose vehicles (SPVs) should be consolidated under AASB 10: Consolidated Financial Statements. If these SPVs meet the criteria for consolidation, the assets remain on ANZ’s balance sheet and are classified and valued in accordance with AASB 9: Financial Instruments. Currently, transactions with all of ANZ’s securitisation SPVs are treated as financing transactions. Securitisation services based on customer’s generated assets include warehouse and term fund facilities which are treated as loans.\nFor synthetic securitisations of ANZ originated assets, any transferred credit exposure is recognised through the fair value measurement of the credit derivative established within the structure.\nFor full details of the principal accounting policies governing ANZ’s securitisation activities are outlined in ANZ’s 2019 Annual Report, Notes to the Financial Statements. These include the valuation, derecognition, consolidation and income recognition principles outlined in the accounting policies and key judgements and estimates disclosures in each relevant note. Note 27 – Structured Entities and Note 28 – Transfers of Financial Assets also provides details about the nature of ANZ’s securitisation activities and certain accounting policies as they specifically apply to these activities. The impact of the application of these policies to securitisation activities have not changed since the prior year, notwithstanding the introduction of AASB 9: Financial Instruments which replaces AASB 139: Financial Recognition and Measurement from 1 October 2018.\nTo the extent that ANZ has exposures intended to be securitised, they could reside in either the banking or trading book.\nTo the extent that ANZ has entered into contractual arrangements that could require it to provide financial support for securitised assets e.g. liquidity facilities, these are recognised in accordance with the accounting policies set out in ANZ’s 2019 Annual Report.\nSignificant changes in quantitative information since the last reporting period\nDuring the year, ANZ executed a $1.5 billion residential mortgage-backed securitisation which settled on 19 June 2019.\n62\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nBanking Book\nTable 12(g): Banking Book: Traditional and synthetic securitisation

CMRC is responsible for the oversight and control of credit, market, insurance and material financial risks across the ANZ Group and meets at least monthly.\nThe Market Risk function is a specialist risk management unit independent of the business that is responsible for:\nDesigning and implementing policies and procedures to ensure market risk exposures are managed within the appetite and limit framework set by the Board.\nMeasuring and monitoring market risk exposures, and approving counterparty and associated risks.\nThe ongoing effectiveness and appropriateness of the risk management framework.\nTraded Market Risk\nTraded Market Risk is the risk of loss from changes in the value of financial instruments due to movements in price factors for both physical and derivative trading positions. Trading positions arise from transactions where ANZ acts as principal with customers, financial exchanges or inter-bank counterparties.\nThe Traded, Foreign Exchange and Commodity Market Risk Policy and accompanying procedures (together the “TFC Framework”) governs the management of traded market risk and its key components include:\nA clear definition of the trading book.\nA comprehensive set of requirements that promote the proactive identification and communication of risk.\nA robust Value at Risk (VaR) quantification approach supplemented by comprehensive stress testing.\nA comprehensive limit framework that controls all material market risks.\nAn independent Market Risk function with specific responsibilities.\nRegular and effective reporting of market risk to executive management and the Board.\nNon-Traded Market Risk\nNon-Traded Market Risk is the market risk associated with the management of non-traded interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange exposures from the Group’s foreign currency capital and earnings.\nIncluded in Non-Traded Market risk is Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB). This is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the overall and relative level of interest rates for different tenors, differences in the actual versus expected net interest margin, and the potential valuation risk associated with embedded options in financial instruments and bank products.\nIn quantifying risk, all material market risk factors need to be identified and reflected within the risk measurement approach. Non-traded market risk (or balance sheet risk) comprises the management of non-traded interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and foreign exchange exposures from the Group’s foreign currency capital and earnings.\n73\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nANZ has a detailed market risk management and control framework, to support its trading and balance sheet activities, which incorporates an independent risk measurement approach to quantify the magnitude of market risk within the trading and balance sheet portfolios. This approach, along with related analysis, identifies the range of possible outcomes that can be expected over a given period of time, and establishes the likelihood of those outcomes and allocates an appropriate amount of capital to support these activities.\nMarkets Risk is a specialist risk management unit independent of the business that is responsible for measuring and monitoring market risk. Markets Risk has implemented policies and procedures to keep ANZ’s market risk exposures managed within the appetite and limit framework set by the Board.\nMeasurement of Traded Market Risk\nANZ’s traded market risk management framework incorporates a risk measurement approach to quantify the magnitude of market risk within trading books. This approach and related analysis identifies the range of possible outcomes that can be expected over a given period of time and establishes the relative likelihood of those outcomes.\nANZ’s key tools to measure and manage traded market risk on a daily basis are VaR, sensitivity measures and stress tests. VaR is calculated using a historical simulation with a 500 day observation period for standard VaR, and a one- year stressed period for stressed VaR. Traded VaR is calculated at a 99% confidence level for both standard VaR and Stressed VaR. Standard VaR is calculated over both a one-day and a ten-day holding period, while Stressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day holding period.\nANZ also undertakes a wide range of stress tests on the Group trading portfolio and to individual trading portfolios. Standard stress tests are applied daily measuring the potential loss that could arise from the largest market movements observed since 2008 over specific holding periods. Holding periods used to calculate stress parameters differ and reflect the relative liquidity of each product type. Results from stress testing on plausible severe scenarios are also calculated daily.\nVaR and stress tests are supplemented by loss limits and detailed control limits. Loss limits are designed to ensure that in the event of continued losses from a trading activity, the trading activity is stopped and senior management reviews before trading resumed. Where necessary, detailed control limits such as sensitivity or position limits are also in place to ensure appropriate control is exercised over a specific risk or product.\nComparison of VaR estimates to gains/losses\nBack testing involves comparing VaR calculations with corresponding profit and loss to identify how often trading losses exceed the calculated VaR. For APRA back testing purposes, VaR is calculated at the 99% confidence interval with a one-day holding period.\nBack testing is conducted daily, and outliers are analysed to determine whether they are the result of trading decisions, systemic changes in market conditions or issues related to the VaR model (historical data or model calibration).\nANZ uses actual and hypothetical profit and loss data. Hypothetical data is designed to remove the impacts of intraday trading and sales margins. It is calculated as the difference between the value of the prior day portfolio at prior day closing rates and the value at current day closing rates.

Market Risk expediently escalates details of any limit breach to the appropriate discretion holder within Market Risk and to Group Risk, and reports to the CMRC each month.\nMarket Risk monitors and analyses back testing results daily and reports results to the CMRC quarterly.\nTotal traded market risks back testing exceptions were within the APS 116 green zone for the period.\nMitigation of market risk\nThe Market Risk team’s responsibilities, including the reporting and escalation processes described above, are fundamental to how market risk is managed. Market Risk has a presence in all the major dealing operations centres in Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Europe and America.\nCommodities risk\nCommodity price risk arises as a result of movement in prices or the implied volatilities of various commodities. All direct commodity price exposures are managed in the trading book by the Markets business and monitored by Market Risk in accordance with the TFC framework.\nForeign exchange risk\nForeign exchange risk arises as a result of movements in values or the implied volatilities of exchange rates.\nExposures from ANZ’s normal operating business and trading activities are recorded in core multi-currency systems and managed within the trading book in accordance with the TFC framework.\nStructural exposures from foreign investments and capital management activities are managed in accordance with policies approved by the Board Risk Committee, with the main objective of ensuring that ANZ’s capital ratio is largely protected from changes in foreign exchange. As at 30 September 2019, ANZ’s investment in ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited is the main source of the structural foreign exchange exposure.\n76\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nChapter 8 – Operational risk\nTable 15 Operational risk\nDefinition of operational risk\nOperational Risk is defined as the risk of loss and/or non-compliance with laws resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, and/or from external events. This definition includes legal risk, and the risk of reputation loss, or damage arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, but excludes strategic risk.\nANZ’s I.AM (Identify, Act, Monitor) - Operational Risk and Compliance Framework, taking into consideration the internal and external environment in which ANZ operates at any point in time, allows for more targeted focus on particular areas of operational risk. Currently, ANZ has identified the following types of operational risk as separate Key Material Risks:\n\nCompliance Risk: ANZ uses the same policies, governance, management and systems for Operational Risk and Compliance Risk. These are described below.\nReputation Risk: ANZ uses some additional policies, governance, management and systems for managing\nReputation Risk. These are described below.\n\nTechnology Risk: ANZ uses some additional policies, governance, management and systems for managing Technology Risk.\nANZ has been authorised by APRA to use the advanced measurement approach (AMA) for calculation of Operational Risk capital requirements under APS 115 Capital Adequacy: Advanced Measurement Approaches to Operational Risk. This methodology applies across all of ANZ. For the purposes of RBNZ capital adequacy, ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd uses Reserve Bank of New Zealand standardised approach to Operational risk capital calculation.\nOperational risk governance and structure\nThe primary responsibilities for operational risk are vested by the Operational Risk Approach in the Board Risk Committee and Operational Risk Executive Committee.\nThe Board Risk Committee:\napprove the Operational Risk Approach\n\nidentify, act on and monitor Operational Risk, at a group level\npromote a culture that supports the organisation to identify, act on and monitor Operational Risk\nOperational Risk Executive Committee:\nendorse the Operational Risk Approach\nmonitor the implementation of the Operational Risk Approach, at a group level\nassist the Board Risk Committee to identify, act on and monitor Operational Risk, at a group level\npromote a culture that supports the organisation to identify, act on and monitor Operational Risk\nRisk management framework\nANZ operates three lines of defence model for the management of Operational Risk. Each line of defence has defined roles, responsibilities and escalation paths to support effective two way communication and management of Operational Risk at ANZ. There are also on-going review mechanisms in place to ensure the I.AM - Operational Risk and Compliance Framework continues to meet organisational needs and regulatory requirements.\nFirst line\nThe Business has first line of defence responsibility for managing Operational Risk including obligations to:\n\ntake primary accountability for the identification, measurement and management of key risks and the related control environment.\n77\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nSecond line\nOperational Risk functions (Division and Group) form the second line of defence.\nDivision Risk is accountable for:\nundertaking review and challenge of business activities and ensuring that the strategy is maintained across the\ndivision.\nGroup Operational Risk is accountable for:\ndeveloping and maintaining relevant policies and procedures to ensure continuing appropriateness of the I.AM -\nOperational Risk and Compliance Framework and to support its consistent execution, and\nsetting and monitoring compliance with the Group Operational Risk, Risk Appetite Statements (RAS).\nThird line\nInternal Audit forms the third line of defence and is accountable for:\nproviding independent and objective assurance to management and the ANZ Board regarding compliance with\npolicy and regulatory requirements;\nperforming objective assessments across all geographies, divisions, lines of business and processes, and\nundertaking independent review of the adequacy of the I.AM - Operational Risk and Compliance Framework.\nCollectively Internal Audit, Operational Risk functions, Divisions and Business Units are responsible for monitoring and reporting to Executive Management, the Board, Regulators and others on all matters related to the measurement and management of Operational Risk.\nOperational Risk Framework\nANZ’s I.AM - Operational Risk and Compliance Framework is delivered through:\n\nLevel 1 ANZ Board Operational Risk Approach (the policy) – approved by the Board Risk Committee, outlines the core standards, roles and responsibilities and minimum requirements of the way in which operational risks and obligations are identified, acted on and monitored across ANZ sets the Operational Risk principles for governing the overall measurement and management of Operational Risk across ANZ.\n\nLevel 2A Operational Risk Procedures (the Requirements, and Lifecycle, Roles and Responsibilities) – owned by Group Operational Risk, provide the procedures to support the consistent application of Level 1 Policy across ANZ. The procedures are further augmented by tools, templates, systems and on-going training.\n78\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nOperational risk mitigation\nIn line with industry practice, ANZ obtains insurance to cover those Operational Risks where cost-effective premiums can be obtained. In conducting their business, Business Units are advised to act as if uninsured and not to use insurance as a guaranteed mitigants for operational risk.\nANZ has business continuity, recovery and crisis management plans. The intention of the business continuity and recovery plans is to ensure critical business functions can be maintained, or restored in a timely fashion, in the event of material disruptions arising from internal or external events.\nCrisis management planning at Group and country levels supplement business continuity plans in the event of a broader group or country crisis. Crisis management plans include crisis team structures, roles, responsibilities and contact lists, and are subject to testing.\nOperational risk reporting\nANZ’s I.AM - Operational Risk and Compliance Framework includes a global, web-based Risk, Compliance and IT Governance tool that provides ANZ the source of truth and provides greater transparency and integrity of Risk, Controls, Obligations and Events information across ANZ.\nOREC’s role is to monitor and oversight at an enterprise level the state of Operational Risk and compliance management and to instigate any necessary corrective actions.\nANZ has been authorised by APRA to use the advanced measurement approach (AMA) for calculation of operational risk capital requirements under APS 115 Capital Adequacy: Advanced Measurement Approaches to Operational Risk. This methodology applies across all of ANZ. However, for the purposes of RBNZ reporting, ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd uses Reserve Bank of New Zealand standardised approach to Operational risk capital calculation.\nOperational risk management\nThe objective of ANZ’s approach to Operational Risk is to ensure that risks are identified, assessed, measured, evaluated, treated, monitored and reported in a structured environment with appropriate governance oversight.\nThe I.AM - Operational Risk and Compliance Framework includes management and measurement of operational risks and compliance with laws, regulations, industry standards, codes and principles of good governance, and internal policies and procedures. It is founded on ANZ’s values and culture, which focus on doing what’s right and being ethical, accountable, trustworthy and transparent in our decisions.\nANZ takes a risk based approach to the management of Operational Risks and obligations. This enables ANZ to be consistent in proactively identifying, assessing, managing, reporting and escalating Operational Risk related risk exposures, while respecting the specific obligations of each jurisdiction in which we operate.\nDay-to-day management of Operational Risk is the responsibility of business unit line management and staff. Risk management, supported by a strong Risk Culture, ensures all staff are thinking about and managing risk on a daily basis – “Risk is Everyone’s Responsibility”. However, Senior Management needs visibility of Key Risks. These are the risks that if they materialised, would adversely affect the achievement of business objectives, ANZ’s reputation, legal and regulatory compliance or impact key processes.\nANZ’s advanced measurement approach\nGroup Operational Risk is responsible for maintaining ANZ’s AMA for the measurement and allocation of operational risk capital.\nOperational Risk Capital is held to protect depositors and shareholders of the bank from rare and severe unexpected losses. In order to quantify the overall Operational Risk profile, ANZ maintains and calculates Operational Risk Capital (including regulatory and economic capital), on at least a six monthly basis. The capital model uses the following data as inputs:\nhistorical internal losses captured and reported in the bank wide Compliance and Operational Risk platform; • relevant external losses, sourced from the Operational Risk Data Exchange (ORX), an industry data base comprising the anonymised loss data from over 90 member banks;\nscenario analysis - unexpected potential loss estimates for severe but plausible risk events which are calculated using exposure models developed using business data and inputs from subject matter experts.\nOnce calculated, the capital is allocated to divisions based on the historic loss experience and exposure to scenarios. Understanding the divisional exposure to scenarios (and their underlying risk drivers) allows lines of business to consider capital impacts when making decisions. Accordingly, capital allocations are structured to encourage businesses to effectively manage their operational risk exposures e.g. improve controls, reduce losses etc.\n79\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nOperational Risk Regulatory Capital to meet the regulatory capital soundness standard is based on a 99.9% confidence interval in accordance with APS 115. Operational Risk Economic Capital i based on 99.97% confidence interval.\nDefinition of compliance risk\nCompliance Risk is a subset of Operational Risk. It covers the risk of failure to act in accordance with laws, regulations, industry standards and codes, internal policies and procedures and principles of good governance as applicable to ANZ’s businesses.\nCompliance\nThe consequences of Compliance failure may include significant legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss (fines, civil penalties, damages) diminished reputation or restrictions on the ability of ANZ to do business. In order for the Business to be able to identify and manage Compliance Risk, they must identify their Regulatory Obligations and their impacted business activities, and maintain and monitor key controls.\nCompliance specific approaches include:\n\nCentralised management of key obligations via a Global Obligations Library, enabling ANZ's change management capability in relation to new and revised obligations.\n\nAn emphasis on the identification of changing regulations and the business environment, to enable proactive assessment of emerging compliance risks.\n\nRecognition of incident management as a separate element to enhance ANZ's ability to identify, manage and report on incidents/breaches in a timely manner.\nManagement of the Whistle-blower Protection Policy\nANZ will ensure there is an effective and fit for purpose channel, allowing employees and contractors to make confidential, anonymous submissions regarding concerns relating to accounting, internal control, compliance, audit and other matters.\n80\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nChapter 9 – Equities\nTable 16\nEquities – Disclosures for banking book positions\nDefinition and categorisation of equity investments held in the banking book\nEquity risk is the risk of financial loss arising from the unexpected reduction in value of equity investments not held in the trading book including those of the Group’s associates. ANZ’s equity exposures in the banking book are primarily categorised as follows:\nEquity investments that are taken for strategic reasons - These transactions represent strategic business initiatives and include ANZ’s investments in partnership arrangements with financial institutions in Asia. These investments are undertaken after extensive analysis and due diligence by Group Strategy, internal specialists and external advisors, where appropriate. Board approval is required prior to committing to any investments over delegated authorities, and all regulatory notification requirements are met. Performance of these investments is monitored by both the owning business unit and Group Strategy to ensure that it is within expectations and the values of the investments are tested at least six monthly for impairment.\nEquity investments made as the result of a work out of a problem exposure - From time to time, ANZ will take an equity stake in a customer as part of a work out arrangement for problem exposures. These investments are made only where there is no other viable option available and form an immaterial part of ANZ’s equity exposures.\nValuation of and accounting for equity investments in the banking book\nIn line with Group Accounting Policy the accounting treatment of equity investments depends on whether ANZ has significant influence over the investee.\nInvestments in associates\nWhere significant influence exists, the investment is classified as an Investment in Associate in the financial statements. ANZ adopts the equity method of accounting for associates. ANZ’s share of the results of associates is included in the consolidated income statement. The associate investments are recognised at cost plus ANZ’s share of post-acquisition net assets. Interests in associates are reviewed bi-annually for impairment, using either market value, or a discounted cash flow methodology to assess value in-use. As at 30 September 2019 the carrying value of these investments were supported by value in use calculations.\nFrom 1 October 2018 – Investment Securities\nWhere ANZ does not have significant influence over the investee, the instrument is categorised as an investment security and classified as fair value through profit and loss, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement, unless designated irrevocably on acquisition as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). If this election is made, gains or losses are not reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss on disposal of the investment. However, gains or losses may be reclassified within equity.\nPrior to 1 October 2018 - Available-for-Sale Investments\nWhere ANZ does not have significant influence over the investee, the investment is classified as Available-for-Sale (AFS). The investment is initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Changes in the fair value of the investments are recognised in an equity reserve with any impairment recognised in the income statement. When the asset is sold the cumulative gain or loss relating to the asset held in the AFS revaluation reserve was transferred to the income statement.\n81\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nTable 16(b) and 16(c): Equities – Types and nature of Banking Book investments\nSep 19\nEquity investments\n$M\nBalance sheet value\nFair value\nValue of listed (publicly traded) equities\n4,043\n3,459\nValue of unlisted (privately held) equities\n135\n135\nTotal\n4,178\n3,594\nMar 19\nEquity investments\n$M\nBalance sheet value\nFair value\nValue of listed (publicly traded) equities\n3,937\n3,683\nValue of unlisted (privately held) equities\n119\n119\nTotal\n4,056\n3,802\nSep 18\nEquity investments\n$M\nBalance sheet value\nFair value\nValue of listed (publicly traded) equities\n3,554\n2,869\nValue of unlisted (privately held) equities\n86\n86\nTotal\n3,640\n2,955\nTable 16(d) and 16(e): Equities – gains (losses)\nHalf Year\nHalf Year\nHalf Year\nSep 19\nMar 19\nSep 18\nRealised gains (losses) on equity investments\n$M\n$M\n$M\nCumulative realised gains (losses) from disposals and liquidations in the reporting period Cumulative realised losses from impairment and writedowns in the reporting period\n\n\n42\n\n124\n\n\n42\n124\nHalf Year\nHalf Year\nHalf Year\nSep 19\nMar 19\nSep 18\nUnrealised gains (losses) on equity investments\n$M\n$M\n$M\nTotal unrealised gains (losses)\n(88)\n160\n36\nReversal of prior period unrealised gains (losses) from disposals and liquidations in the reporting period\n\n\n\nTotal unrealised gains (losses) included in Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 capital\n(88)\n160\n36\nTable 16(f): Equities Risk Weighted Assets\nFrom 1 January 2013 all banking book equity exposures are deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital.\n82\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nChapter 10 – Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book\nTable 17\nInterest Rate Risk in the Banking Book\nDefinition of Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB)\nInterest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) relates to the potential adverse impact of changes in market interest rates on ANZ’s future net interest income. The risk generally arises from:\nRepricing and yield curve risk - the risk to earnings or market value as a result of changes in the overall level of\ninterest rates and/or the relativity of these rates across the yield curve.\nBasis risk - the risk to earnings or market value arising from volatility in the interest margin applicable to banking\nbook items.\nOptionality risk – the risk to earnings or market value arising from the existence of stand-alone or embedded\noptions in banking book items.\nRegulatory capital approach\nANZ has received approval from APRA to use the IMA for the calculation of regulatory capital for IRRBB, under APS 117 Capital Adequacy: Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (Advanced ADIs).\nGovernance\nThe Board Risk Committee has established a risk appetite for IRRBB and delegated authority to the Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO) to manage the strategic position (capital investment term) and oversee the interest rate risk arising from the repricing of asset and liabilities (mismatch risk) in the banking book. GALCO has delegated the management of this mismatch risk to the Markets business.\nMarket Risk is the independent function responsible for:\nDesigning and implementing policies and procedures to ensure that IRRBB exposure is managed within the limit framework set by the Board Risk Committee.\nMonitoring and measuring IRRBB market risk exposure, compliance with limits and policies.\nEnsuring ongoing effectiveness and appropriateness of the risk management framework.\nRisk Management framework\nIRRBB is managed under a comprehensive measurement and reporting framework, supported by an independent Market Risk function. Key components of the framework include:\nA comprehensive set of policies that promote proactive risk identification and communication.\nFunds Transfer Pricing framework to transfer interest rate risk from business units so it can be managed by the Markets business and monitored by Market Risk.\nQuantifying the magnitude of risks and controlling the potential impact that changes in market interest rates can have on the net interest income and balance sheet market value of ANZ.\nRegular and effective reporting of IRRBB to executive management and the Board.\n83\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nMeasurement of interest rate risk in the banking book\nANZ uses the following principal techniques to quantify and monitor IRRBB:\n\nInterest Rate Sensitivity - this is an estimate of the change in economic value of the banking book due to a 1 basis point move in a specific part of the yield curve.\nEarnings at risk (EaR) - this is an estimate of the amount of income that is at risk from interest rate movements over a given holding period, expressed to a 97.5% level of statistical confidence.\nValue at risk (VaR) - this is an estimate of the impact of interest rate changes on the banking book’s market value, expressed to a 99% level of statistical confidence for a given holding period.\nMarket Value loss limits - this mitigates the potential for embedded losses within the banking book.\nStress testing - standard extraordinary forward looking and repricing term assumptions tests are used to highlight potential risk which may not be captured by VaR, and how the portfolio might behave under extraordinary circumstances.\nThe calculations used to quantify IRRBB require assumptions to be made about the repricing term of exposures that do not have a contractually defined repricing date, such as deposits with no set maturity dates, and prepayments. Changes to these assumptions require GALCO approval.\nBasis and optionality risks are measured using Monte Carlo simulation techniques, to generate a theoretical worst outcome at a specified confidence level (typically no less than at a 99% level of statistical confidence) less the average outcome.\nReporting of interest rate risk in the banking book\nMarket Risk analyses the output of ANZ’s VaR, EaR and Stress Testing calculations daily. Compliance with the risk appetite and limit framework is reported to CMRC, GALCO and the Board Risk Committee.\nANZ’s interest rate risk in the banking book capital requirement\nThe IRRBB regulatory capital requirements includes a value for repricing and yield curve risk, basis and optionality risks based on a 99% confidence interval, one year holding period and a six year historical data set.\nEmbedded losses also contribute to make up the capital requirement and are calculated as the difference between the book value of banking book items and the current economic value taking hedge accounting aspects into account.\nResults of standard shock scenario\nThe Basel II framework sets out a standard shock scenario of a 200 basis point parallel shift change in interest rates, in order to establish a comparable test across banks.\nTable 17(b) that follows shows the results of this test by currency of the exposures outside the trading book.\n84\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nTable 17(b): Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book\nChange in Economic Value\nStandard Shock Scenario Stress Testing:\nSep 19\nMar 19\nSep 18\nInterest rate shock applied\n$M\n$M\n$M\nAUD\n200 basis point parallel increase\n(508)\n(336)\n(485)\n200 basis point parallel decrease\n527\n327\n497\nNZD\n200 basis point parallel increase\n(136)\n(76)\n(133)\n200 basis point parallel decrease\n126\n64\n129\nUSD\n200 basis point parallel increase\n(34)\n\n(76)\n200 basis point parallel decrease\n38\n1\n76\nGBP\n200 basis point parallel increase\n18\n33\n21\n200 basis point parallel decrease\n(19)\n(34)\n(21)\nOther\n200 basis point parallel increase\n(44)\n24\n(48)\n200 basis point parallel decrease\n50\n(22)\n52\nIRRBB regulatory capital\n554\n580\n705\nIRRBB regulatory RWA\n6,922\n7,245\n8,814\nIRRBB stress testing methodology\nStress tests within ANZ include standard extraordinary forward looking and repricing term assumptions tests. These tests are used to highlight potential risk which may not be captured by VaR, and how the portfolio might behave under extraordinary circumstances. Standard stress tests include statistically derived scenarios based on historical yield curve movements. These combine parallel shocks with twists and bends in the curve to produce a wide range of hypothetical scenarios at high statistical confidence levels, with the single worst scenario identified and reported. Other stress tests include interest rate moves from historical periods of stress possible future stress test as well as stresses to assumptions made about the repricing term of exposures. The extraordinary rate move scenarios include rate changes over the stressed periods in financial market history. Forward looking stress tests include interest rate moves from plausible future severe scenarios. Stresses of the repricing term assumptions investigate scenarios where actual repricing terms are significantly different to those modelled.\n85\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nSeptember 2019\nChapter 11 – Leverage and Liquidity Coverage Ratio\nLeverage Ratio\nThe Leverage Ratio requirements are part of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) Basel III capital framework. It is a simple, non-risk based supplement or backstop to the current risk based capital requirements and is intended to restrict the build-up of excessive leverage in the banking system.\nConsistent with the BCBS definition, APRA’s Leverage Ratio compares Tier 1 Capital to the Exposure Measure (expressed as a percentage) as defined by APS 110. APRA has not finalised a minimum Leverage Ratio requirement for Australian ADIs, although they have proposed a minimum of 3.5% for internal ratings based approach ADI. At 30 September 2019, the Group’s Leverage Ratio of 5.6% was above the 3% minimum currently required by the BCBS. Table 18 below shows the Group’s Leverage Ratio calculation as at 30 September 2019 and Table 19 summarises the reconciliation of accounting assets and leverage ratio exposure measure at 30 September

associated with the bank’s corporate and retail deposit portfolios, offset by inflows from maturing loans. While cash outflows associated with derivatives are material, these are effectively offset by derivative cash inflows.\nThe composition of the liquid asset portfolio has remained relatively stable

Impairment\nSeptember 2019\nAuthorised Deposit-taking Institution.\nCVA charge is an additional capital requirement under Basel III for bilateral derivative exposures. Derivatives not cleared through a central exchange/counterparty are subject to this additional capital charge and also receive normal CRWA treatment under Basel II principles.\nCollectively assessed provisions for credit impairment represent the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculated in accordance with AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9). These incorporate forward looking information and do not require an actual loss event to have occurred for an impairment provision to be recognised.\nThe aggregate of all claims, commitments and contingent liabilities arising from on- and off-balance sheet transactions (in the banking book and trading book) with the counterparty or group of related counterparties.\nThe risk of financial loss resulting from a counterparty failing to fulfil its obligations, or from a decrease in credit quality of a counterparty resulting in a loss in value.\nOver the life of a derivative instrument, ANZ uses a CVA model to adjust fair value to take into account the impact of counterparty credit quality. The methodology calculates the present value of expected losses over the life of the financial instrument as a function of probability of default, loss given default, expected credit risk exposure and an asset correlation factor. Impaired derivatives are also subject to a CVA.\nThe number of days a credit obligation is overdue, commencing on the date that the arrears or excess occurs and accruing for each completed calendar day thereafter.\nExposure At Default is defined as the expected facility exposure at the date of default.\nFacilities are classified as impaired when there is doubt as to whether the contractual amounts due, including interest and other payments, will be met in a timely manner. Impaired assets include impaired facilities, and impaired derivatives. Impaired derivatives have a credit valuation adjustment (CVA), which is a market assessment of the credit risk of the relevant counterparties.\nImpaired loans comprise of drawn facilities where the customer’s status is defined as impaired.\nIndividual provision charge is the amount of expected credit losses on financial instruments assessed for impairment on an individual basis (as opposed to on a collective basis). It takes into account expected cash flows over the lives of those financial instruments.\nIndividually assessed provisions for credit impairment are calculated in accordance with AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9). They are assessed on a case-by-case basis for all individually managed impaired assets taking into consideration factors such as the realisable value of security (or other credit mitigants), the likely return available upon liquidation or bankruptcy, legal uncertainties, estimated costs involved in recovery, the market price of the exposure in secondary markets and the amount and timing of expected receipts and recoveries.\n91\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nInternationally Comparable Basel III Capital Ratio\nMarket risk\nOperational risk\nPast due facilities\nQualifying Central Counterparties (QCCP)\nRecoveries\nRestructured items\nRisk Weighted Assets (RWA)\nSecuritisation risk\nWrite-Offs\nSeptember 2019\nThe Internationally Comparable Basel III CET1 ratios are ANZ’s interpretation of the regulations documented in the Basel Committee publications; “Basel 3: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems” (June 2011) and “International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards” (June 2006). They also information paper entitled identified include differences International Capital Comparison Study (13 July 2015).\nin APRA’s\nThe risk to ANZ’s earnings arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, volatility, correlations or from fluctuations in bond, commodity or equity prices. ANZ has grouped market risk into two broad categories to facilitate the measurement, reporting and control of market risk:\nTraded market risk - the risk of loss from changes in the value of financial instruments due to movements in price factors for both physical and derivative trading positions. Trading positions arise from transactions where ANZ acts as principal with customers, financial exchanges or inter- bank counterparties.\nNon-traded market risk (or balance sheet risk) - comprises interest rate risk in the banking book and the risk to the AUD denominated value of ANZ’s capital and earnings due to foreign exchange rate movements.\nThe risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events including legal risk but excluding reputation risk.\nFacilities where a contractual payment has not been met or the customer is outside of contractual arrangements are deemed past due. Past due facilities include those operating in excess of approved arrangements or where scheduled repayments are outstanding but do not include impaired assets.\nQCCP is a central counterparty which is an entity that interposes itself between counterparties to derivative contracts. Trades with QCCP attract a more favorable risk weight calculation.\nPayments received and taken to profit for the current period for the amounts written off in prior financial periods.\nRestructured items comprise facilities in which the original contractual terms have been modified for reasons related to the financial difficulties of the customer. Restructuring may consist of reduction of interest, principal or other payments legally due, or an extension in maturity materially beyond those typically offered to new facilities with similar risk.\nAssets (both on and off-balance sheet) are risk weighted according to each asset’s inherent potential for default and what the likely losses would be in the case of default. In the case of non-asset backed risks (i.e. market and the capital operational risk), RWA requirements for those risks by 12.5.\nis determined by multiplying\nThe risk of credit related losses greater than expected due to a securitisation failing to operate as anticipated, or of the values and risks accepted or transferred, not emerging as expected.\nFacilities are written off against the related provision for impairment when they are assessed as partially or fully uncollectable, and after proceeds from the realisation of any collateral have been received. Where individual provisions recognised in previous periods have subsequently decreased or are no longer required, such impairment losses are reversed in the current period income statement.\n92\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 disclosure\nThis page has been intentionally left blank\n93\nSeptember 2019\nANZ Basel III Pillar 3 Disclosure\nJune 2017"

It will be put to the Meeting only if 25% or more of the votes validly cast on the adoption of the Remuneration Report (item 3) are against the adoption of the Report, i.e., if a “second strike” is received. A “first strike” was received in relation to the adoption of last year’s Remuneration Report, with a 33.76% vote against the adoption of that Report.\nCouncil Member: Australian Strategic Policy Institute (from 2016).\nRelevant Former Directorships held in last three years, include Former Chairman: OECD Asian Senior Budget Officials Network (2014–2016).\nFormer Public Policy Fellow: ANU Crawford School of Public Policy (2012-2016).\nAge: 59.

At the Spill Meeting, all the Directors of the Company who were in office when the Board resolution to approve the Company’s 2019 Directors’ Report was passed, other than the Company’s Managing Director, Mr Elliott, will automatically vacate office at the conclusion of the Spill Meeting unless they stand for re-election and are re-elected at the Spill Meeting. The Directors who were in office when the Board resolution to approve the Company’s 2019 Directors’ Report was passed (other than Mr Elliott) are:\nAs required by the Corporations Act, the Board presents the Remuneration Report to shareholders for consideration and adoption by a non-binding vote. The Remuneration Report contains:\nMr David Gonski AC\nMs Ilana Atlas\nMs Paula Dwyer\n\ninformation about Board policy for determining the nature and amount of remuneration of the Company’s Directors and most senior executives;\nMs Jane Halton AO PSM\nThe Right Hon Sir John Key, GNZM AC\na description of the relationship between the remuneration\nMr Graeme Liebelt\npolicy and the Company’s performance; and\nMr John Macfarlane\nremuneration details for key management personnel (including the Directors of the Company) for the period ended 30 September 2019.\nThe Remuneration Report, which is part of the 2019 Annual Report, can be found on the Company’s website at anz.com/annualreport or can be obtained by contacting the Company’s Share Registrar, Computershare.\nIf the resolution in item 4 is put to, and passed at, the 2019 Annual General Meeting, Mr Liebelt and Ms Halton would need to be re-elected at the Spill Meeting even if they are re-elected at the 2019 Annual General Meeting. If Mr O’Sullivan, who became a Director on 4 November 2019, is elected at the 2019 Annual General Meeting, he would not be required to stand for re-election at the Spill Meeting, given he joined the Board after the approval of the 2019 Directors’ Report.\nAt last year’s Annual General Meeting, while approximately two thirds of the shares voted supported our Remuneration Report, approximately one third of the votes cast were against the resolution to adopt the 2018 Remuneration Report. This “against vote” of at least 25% constituted what is referred to as a “first strike”. If a “second strike” is received at the 2019 Annual General Meeting in relation to the adoption of this year’s Remuneration Report, the resolution in item 4 (Spill Resolution) will be put to a vote in accordance with the Corporations Act.\nYour Directors take shareholders’ concerns and feedback on remuneration very seriously. Each year the Company consults broadly to better understand the views of investors and other stakeholders. In 2019, this resulted in a number of refinements being made to the remuneration framework and to the variable remuneration awarded to executives. These changes are outlined in the Remuneration Report.\nReasons why the Board recommends that shareholders vote against item 4 if it is put to the Meeting\nThe Board considers the following factors to be relevant to shareholders’ decisions on how to vote on this item:\nthe Board and Management’s actions to address the concerns expressed by shareholders in relation to remuneration issues, including: – increased and more effective disclosure in the 2019 Remuneration Report in relation to the assessment of executive performance;\n– significant differentiation in the remuneration awarded to our executives in the 2019 Financial Year, reflecting different levels of performance among our most senior leaders, as set out in the 2019 Remuneration Report;\n10\n– the implementation during the 2019 Financial Year of a\nstrengthened Accountability and Consequence Framework to ensure that meaningful consequences are applied to executives and employees at all levels, where it is appropriate, for material risk events, as set out in the 2019 Remuneration Report;\n– the introduction of wide-ranging reforms to how ANZ pays people below its Disclosed Executives, replacing individual bonuses for the vast majority of employees with an incentive based on the overall performance of the Group, as set out in the Chief Executive’s Report within the 2019 Annual Report; and\nthe significant cost of, and disruption involved in, convening and holding a Spill Meeting within 90 days of this Annual General Meeting. Board Recommendation: Having regard to the matters set out above, the Board does not consider the proposed resolution to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Therefore, the Board recommends that shareholders eligible to do so vote against item 4.\nITEM 5 GRANT OF PERFORMANCE RIGHTS TO MR S C ELLIOTT\nAs part of Mr Elliott’s Variable Remuneration the Company is asking shareholders to approve the proposed grant of Performance Rights to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mr Shayne Elliott, under the ANZ Share Option Plan on the terms and conditions set out below.\nFor the 2019 grant, Long Term Variable Remuneration (LTVR) will be delivered as two tranches of Performance Rights with forward looking performance hurdles where:\n75% will be measured against the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of the Select Financial Services comparator group (Tranche 1); and\n25% will be measured against Absolute Compound Annual Growth\nRate (CAGR) TSR (Tranche 2).\nAt a glance: • Long Term Variable Remuneration (LTVR), in the form of\nPerformance Rights, with a current face value of A$4,200,000 at full vesting (A$2,100,000 at threshold vesting);\nThe Performance Rights will be granted in two tranches:\n– for Tranche 1, the performance condition is based on ANZ’s TSR performance compared against a set comparator group with nil vesting below median, 50% vesting at median (i.e. threshold), and increasing to 100% vesting at the 75th percentile of the relevant comparator group;\n– for Tranche 2, the performance condition is based on ANZ’s Absolute CAGR TSR performance against targets as set by the Board, with nil vesting below 8.5%, 50% vesting at 8.5% (threshold), and increasing to 100% vesting at 12.75%.\n– Performance is assessed at the end of a four-year performance\nperiod (with no retesting).\nIn more detail: A Performance Right is a right to acquire an ordinary fully paid share in the Company at nil cost (i.e. nil exercise price), subject to meeting the applicable performance conditions. To the extent the performance conditions are met, the relevant number of Performance Rights will vest on the fourth anniversary of grant (Vesting Date). Upon vesting the Board will determine whether to settle the Performance Rights with ANZ shares or by payment of a cash equivalent amount.\nMr Elliott’s entitlement to the Performance Rights and to any shares/ cash equivalent payment will be subject to:\nthe Board’s on-going discretion to reduce (including to zero)\nthe number of Performance Rights if the Board considers such a reduction to be necessary or appropriate (see further below); and\nthe rules concerning treatment on termination of employment or\non a change of control referred to below.\nMr Elliott will not be entitled to trade, transfer or otherwise deal in (including by entering into any hedging arrangements in respect of) any Performance Rights, or any entitlement to shares or cash equivalent payment, prior to the Vesting Date.\nIf the Board determines to settle the Performance Rights in shares each Performance Right entitles Mr Elliott to one ANZ ordinary share which will rank equally with shares in the same class, subject to any adjustments in accordance with the Listing Rules. Mr Elliott is not required to pay any amount on grant of the Performance Rights, nor on vesting. The Performance Rights form part of Mr Elliott’s “at risk” remuneration.\nPerformance Rights granted under the ANZ Share Option Plan do not carry any dividend or voting rights.\nIf approval is obtained, it is the intention of the Board that the Performance Rights will be granted to Mr Elliott on 17 December 2019 (but, in any event, not more than 12 months after the date of this Annual General Meeting).\nGrant value and calculation of the number of Performance Rights to be granted Using a face value allocation methodology, the number of Performance Rights proposed to be granted to Mr Elliott will be determined by dividing the face value of the grant (i.e. A$4,200,000) by the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of the Company’s ordinary shares traded on the ASX in the five trading days up to and including 22 November 2019, which is the start of the Performance Period. The actual number of Performance Rights to be granted is not known at this stage as it will depend on the VWAP at the start of the Performance Period. Details of the actual number of Performance Rights will be announced to the ASX and will also be advised to shareholders at the 2019 Annual General Meeting.\nThe grant value will be split into two tranches of Performance Rights (75% Tranche 1 and 25% Tranche 2).\nIf, for example, the VWAP was A$26.50, then 118,867 Performance Rights would be allocated to Mr Elliott for Tranche 1 and 39,622 Performance Rights for Tranche 2, summing to a total allocation of 158,489 Performance Rights.\n11\nPerformance conditions\nTranche 1 The Board has determined that the Performance Rights to be granted to Mr Elliott (if approval is received) under Tranche 1 will be subject to a TSR hurdle which ranks the TSR performance of the Company with the TSR performance of the Select Financial Services comparator group.\nThe Select Financial Services comparator group includes the Bank of Queensland Limited, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited, Commonwealth Bank of Australia Limited, DBS Bank Limited, Macquarie Group Limited, National Australia Bank Limited, Standard Chartered PLC, Suncorp Group Limited and Westpac Banking Corporation.\nThe Board retains discretion to adjust the Absolute CAGR TSR hurdle in exceptional circumstances to ensure that Mr Elliott is neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by matters outside management’s control that materially affect achievement of the Absolute CAGR TSR performance condition.\nIF THE ABSOLUTE COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE TSR OF THE COMPANY:\nTHE PERCENTAGE OF PERFORMANCE RIGHTS WHICH WILL VEST IS:\nDoes not reach 8.5%\n0%\nReaches 8.5%\n50%\nBroadly, TSR is the growth in share price, plus the value of the dividends and distributions on the relevant shares. The TSR is measured over a four year performance period starting on 22 November 2019 and ending on 21 November 2023 (Performance Period). The proportion of the Tranche 1 Performance Rights that will become exercisable will depend on the Company’s TSR relative to the TSR of the constituents in the Comparator Group at the end of the Performance Period.\nExceeds 8.5% but does not reach 12.75%\nReaches or exceeds 12.75%\nProgressive pro rata vesting between 50% and 100% (on a straight line basis)\n100%\nThe level of performance required for each level of vesting, and the percentage of Performance Rights that vest at each level of performance, is set out in the table below. The Performance Rights lapse if the applicable performance condition is not met. There is no re-testing.\nIF THE TSR OF THE COMPANY COMPARED TO THE TSR OF THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE COMPARATOR GROUP:\nTHE PERCENTAGE OF PERFORMANCE RIGHTS WHICH WILL VEST IS:\nDoes not reach the 50th percentile\n0%\nBoard discretion\nThe Board also retains an on-going discretion to reduce (including to zero) the number of Performance Rights granted to Mr Elliott, if the Board considers such a reduction to be necessary or appropriate. This discretion may be exercised, for example, where the Board considers this is necessary to protect the financial soundness of ANZ, to meet unexpected or unknown regulatory requirements or if the Board subsequently considers that the grant was not justified.\nAccordingly, before the scheduled release of any Performance Rights the Board considers whether any malus/downward adjustment of Performance Rights (or deferral of vesting for a further period or periods) should be made.\nReaches or exceeds the 50th percentile\n50%, plus 2% for every one percentile increase above the 50th percentile\nTreatment on termination of employment If:\nMr Elliott resigns prior to the vesting date the Performance Rights\nwill lapse;\nReaches or exceeds the 75th percentile\n100%\nTranche 2 The Board has determined that the Performance Rights to be granted to Mr Elliott (if approval is received) under Tranche 2 will be subject to an Absolute CAGR TSR hurdle with targets outlined below.\nThe Absolute CAGR TSR is measured over the same four year Performance Period that applies to Tranche 1. The proportion of the Tranche 2 Performance Rights that will become exercisable will depend upon the Company’s Absolute CAGR TSR at the end of the Performance Period compared to the targets set by the Board.\nThe level of performance required for each level of vesting, and the percentage of Performance Rights that vest at each level of performance, is set out in the table below. The Performance Rights lapse if the performance condition is not met. There is no re-testing.\nMr Elliott’s employment is terminated by the Company with notice, except as set out below in relation to “good leaver” termination, all unvested Performance Rights as at the full notice termination date1 will lapse;\nMr Elliott’s employment is terminated by the Company for\nmisconduct with notice, all unvested Performance Rights will lapse on cessation of employment. If Mr Elliott’s employment is terminated by the Company for serious misconduct without notice, all Performance Rights will lapse (whether or not the Performance Rights have vested), on cessation of employment; or\nMr Elliott ceases employment in circumstances of death or total and permanent disability, the performance conditions will be waived and all unvested Performance Rights will vest on cessation. In certain circumstances termination may be classified by the Board as a “good leaver” termination. In such case, unless the Board determines otherwise, the number of any unvested Performance\n1. Full notice termination date means the date of cessation of employment or, if later, the date on which cessation of employment would have\noccurred but for any payment made in lieu of notice.\n12\nRights held by Mr Elliott will be adjusted pro-rata for the period from the date of grant to the full notice termination date (with the remainder of the Performance Rights, representing the proportion of the Performance Period from the full notice termination date to the end of the Performance Period, lapsing on cessation of employment) and, where and to the extent the Board determines the applicable performance condition is met, the relevant number of Performance Rights will vest. On vesting, the Board may determine to settle the relevant Performance Rights with a cash equivalent payment, rather than with shares.\nTreatment on change of control The Conditions of Grant will set out the treatment of the Performance Rights on a change of control prior to the Vesting Date. Where a change of control occurs, which includes a person acquiring a relevant interest in at least 50% of the Company’s ordinary shares as a result of a takeover bid, or other similar event, the applicable performance conditions applying to the Performance Rights will be tested and the Performance Rights will vest based on the extent the performance conditions are satisfied. No pro rata reduction in vesting will occur, and vesting will only be determined by the extent to which the relevant performance conditions are satisfied.\nAny Performance Rights which vest based on satisfaction of the performance conditions will vest at a time (being no later than the final date on which the change of control event will occur) determined by the Board.\nAny Performance Rights which do not vest will lapse with effect from the date of the change of control event occurring, unless the Board determines otherwise.\nOther information ANZ provides the following additional information in relation to the proposed grant of Performance Rights to Mr Elliott.\nThe Chief Executive Officer (Mr Elliott) is the only Director entitled to participate in the ANZ Share Option Plan. No associate of any Director is entitled to participate.\nMr Elliott was granted 110,365 Performance Rights on 19 December 2018 at no cost to him, as approved by shareholders at the 2018 Annual General Meeting.\nThere is no loan scheme in relation to the Performance Rights (or the shares underlying them).\nFor the settlement of the Performance Rights on vesting, shares may be issued or acquired on market, or the Board may determine to settle the Performance Rights with a cash equivalent amount. Details of any shares issued under the ANZ Share Option Plan will be published in the Company’s annual report for the relevant period.\nUnder section 200B of the Corporations Act, a company may only give a person a benefit in connection with their ceasing to hold a managerial or executive office in the company or a related body corporate if it is approved by shareholders under section 200E or an exemption applies. Section 200B of the Corporations Act applies to managerial or executive officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, which includes Mr Elliott. The term “benefit” has a wide operation and could include the early vesting of the Performance Rights as contemplated above or otherwise under the ANZ Share Option Plan.\nAccordingly, shareholder approval is also sought for the purpose of section 200E of the Corporations Act to allow vesting of Performance Rights and settlement of them with shares or a cash equivalent payment upon Mr Elliott ceasing employment, (as summarised under “Treatment on termination of employment” above), including where to do so would involve the giving of a “benefit” to Mr Elliott in connection with him ceasing to hold a managerial or executive office. The approval is sought in relation to the Performance Rights proposed to be granted to Mr Elliott under item 5 in this Notice of Meeting.\nThe value of any benefit relating to the Performance Rights given in connection with Mr Elliott ceasing to hold managerial or executive office cannot presently be ascertained. However, matters, events and circumstances that will, or are likely to, affect the calculation of that value are:\nthe number of Performance Rights held by Mr Elliott prior to\ncessation of employment;\nthe circumstances of or reasons for Mr Elliott’s cessation\nof employment (see “Treatment on termination of employment” above);\nthe result of any pro rating on cessation of employment;\nwhether performance hurdles are waived or (if not waived) met, and the number of Performance Rights that vest (which could be all of the Performance Rights held by Mr Elliott);\nwhether the Performance Rights are settled in ANZ shares or by\npayment of a cash equivalent amount; and\nthe market price of ANZ shares on ASX on the date shares are\nprovided to Mr Elliott upon vesting of the Performance Rights or, if the Board decides to settle the Performance Rights by payment of a cash equivalent amount, in the five trading days up to (and including) the date of vesting.\nThe rules of the ANZ Share Option Plan address the impact of rights issues and bonus issues on the Performance Rights.\nA copy of the ANZ Share Option Plan rules is available on request from the Company Secretary.\nBoard Recommendation: The Board considers that the proposed granting of Performance Rights is appropriate and is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, as the grant strengthens the alignment of Mr Elliott’s interests with shareholders, and the Performance Rights provide a strong link between the reward for Mr Elliott’s performance and total shareholder returns over the next four year period.\nThe Board also considers that obtaining shareholder approval to allow Performance Rights to vest upon Mr Elliott ceasing employment in accordance with the Conditions of Grant, as described above, is appropriate and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. It will provide the Company with the ability to ensure its ongoing compliance with section 200B of the Corporations Act and with the Conditions of Grant for the Performance Rights.\nAccordingly, the Board (excluding Mr Elliott because of his interest) recommends that shareholders eligible to do so vote in favour of item 5.\n13\nITEM 6 RESOLUTION REQUISITIONED BY MEMBERS – AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION (NON-BOARD ENDORSED ITEM)\nA group of shareholders holding approximately 0.01% of the Company’s ordinary shares on issue has proposed resolutions under section 249N of the Corporations Act. The Company has included those proposed resolutions as items 6 and 7 in this Notice of Meeting.\nAnother group of shareholders holding less than 0.01% of the Company’s ordinary shares on issue has also proposed a resolution under section 249N of the Corporations Act. The Company has included that proposed resolution as item 8 in this Notice of Meeting.\nThese resolutions are not endorsed by the Board.\nUnder the law and the Company’s Constitution, it is the Board’s responsibility to manage the business of the Company. The Board believes it would be inappropriate to allow interest groups to potentially qualify or compromise its stewardship. If shareholders disagree with the direction the Company is taking, other options are already available to them, as set out above.\nBoard Recommendation: Having regard to the matters set out above, the Board does not consider the proposed resolution to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Therefore, the Board recommends that shareholders vote against item 6.\nITEM 7 RESOLUTION REQUISITIONED BY MEMBERS – TRANSITION PLANNING DISCLOSURE (CONDITIONAL , NON-BOARD ENDORSED ITEM)\nThe same groups of shareholders have also requested, under section 249P of the Corporations Act, that the Company provides statements prepared by them to shareholders about these proposed resolutions. The statements can be found in the Appendix to this Notice of Meeting.\nThe same group of shareholders that proposed the resolution in item 6 has also proposed the resolution in item 7 in this Notice of Meeting. The resolution is an advisory resolution.\nBy including these statements in this Notice of Meeting, the Company does not make any representations as to the truth or accuracy of their contents and disclaims all liability for them.\nThe resolution is not endorsed by the Board.\nThe resolution in item 7 will be proposed to the Meeting only if the resolution in item 6 is passed by the requisite majority.\nReasons why the Board recommends that shareholders vote against item 6\nReasons why the Board recommends that shareholders vote against item 7 if it is put to the Meeting\nThe resolution in item 6 is a proposal to amend the Company’s Constitution to enable shareholders in general meeting, by non- binding advisory resolution, to express an opinion or request information about the way in which a power of the Company partially or exclusively vested in the Directors has been or should be exercised if the matter relates to a material risk identified by the Directors or the Company. The resolution in item 6 is proposed as a special resolution and, to be carried, must be passed by at least 75% of the votes cast by shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution.\nCommitment to supporting energy transition\nANZ acknowledges the Paris Agreement aim of holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and of pursuing efforts towards limiting it to 1.5°C.\nThe transition required is enormous and will require all stakeholders to seek to carefully balance the environmental, social and economic issues in a manner which is acceptable to Australians.\nThe Board respects the rights of shareholders. It does not, however, consider it appropriate to change the Constitution to allow interest groups to promote their various ideological positions in this way, which by law they would not be able to without the change. Shareholders have a number of existing ways in which they can engage with the Company including by asking or submitting questions at general meetings, by distributing members’ statements under the Corporations Act and by choosing whether to support the election of Directors and other resolutions posed at general meetings. The Company also has a variety of existing avenues whereby it seeks robust discussion and can gauge differing opinions, including through regular engagement with retail and institutional shareholders. Such constructive engagement gives the Company important insights into perspectives on the Company’s operations.\nYour Board is committed to ensuring that ANZ continues to be a responsible and sustainable business that is playing its part to support and facilitate this transition to a low carbon economy.\nThis is evidenced in our reporting of our strategies and targets to over time reduce our exposure to carbon intensive sectors while increasing support for lower-carbon energy. Our direct financing of renewables projects has increased almost 30% over the last year. Renewable energy is now over 80% of our electricity generation lending in our project finance portfolio.\nSince 2015 when ANZ confirmed its support for the 2°C goal, ANZ has reviewed its commitments to take account of market developments and government pledges to reduce emissions. The Board understands greater ambition must be balanced with the need for reliable, efficient and affordable energy.\nIn addition, the statement provided in support of this resolution refers to differences between shareholder rights in Australia and those in some other countries. The Board’s view is that if people believe such a change to allow non-binding advisory resolutions is desirable, the appropriate mechanism to effect it is for them to engage with the Australian Government to seek to legislate the change rather than to seek to change the Constitution of individual companies.\nAustralia moving towards a lower-carbon future\nAustralia is making the shift to lower carbon energy sources, principally renewables and gas, but this transformation will take time. Coal currently provides about 60% of Australia’s energy needs. To achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement it is critical to shift to more renewable and low carbon sources of energy. Natural gas has a vital role to play in this shift. For natural gas to fulfil its role as a transition fuel, resource development, additional pipeline capacity and market integration are critical.\n14\nHow ANZ is working with its business customers\nANZ expects and has worked with its business customers to encourage them to consider building climate change mitigation and adaptation risk into their business strategies and establish plans to support the transition. ANZ is taking a number of specific actions to manage its long-term carbon risks and opportunities and to support the below 2°C goal. These include the following:\nANZ is supporting its customers to transition to a low carbon\neconomy, for example, by:\n– providing finance and advisory services for energy efficiency improvements, low carbon energy generation, resilient infrastructure and carbon abatement;\n– contributing directly to investment in the development of low\nor zero emissions industries, technologies and practices through ‘green’ bonds;\n– encouraging the development of new industries and business models, and supporting innovative solutions from small and large business customers;\nANZ is engaging constructively and transparently with\nstakeholders. Among other things, ANZ:\n– identifies, assesses and manages climate-related financial risks and provides clear, decision useful disclosures for our investors using the Financial Stability Board’s Climate related Financial Disclosures Taskforce (TCFD) recommendations;\n– provides regular updates on our progress in our external\nreporting, including disclosing ANZ’s financing of sectors most exposed to the physical and transition risks of climate change; and\n– is participating in a pilot project on implementing the TCFD\nrecommendations for banks, an initiative to develop methods to enable scenario-based, forward-looking assessment and disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities. The initiative is led by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative.\nDisclosure\nANZ is among the sector’s carbon reporting leaders, each year expanding and improving disclosure.\nANZ was the first Australian bank to report under the TCFD.\nThe TCFD included ANZ as a case study in its 2018 status update, noting the bank as “an early supporter of the TCFD recommendations”.\nInvestor groups and the leading global environment, social and governance (ESG) assessment have found your bank to be:\nan ASX ESG reporting leader: the Australian Council of\nSuperannuation Investors 2019;\n“industry best” on climate strategy, with three others within our\nsector globally: Dow Jones Sustainability Index 2019; and\nsole Australian bank to have achieved “Leadership” ranking in the 2018 Carbon Disclosure Project, the benchmark assessment of corporate carbon management.\nTransition challenges\nYour Board understands that some of ANZ’s stakeholders view our financing of fossil fuel industries as a material risk and in direct conflict with our stated position on the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nWe understand this and confirm that we have taken action to act on this concern. Specifically, we point to the halving of our thermal coal exposure within the last five years. However, as Australia moves gradually to rebalance its energy mix other sources of energy must take its place. This will include renewables, to which we have a significant and growing exposure, and gas.\nIt is our considered view that reducing our exposure to gas, as is sought by the resolution, would potentially contribute to a decline in Australia’s energy security. Variable energy sources like wind and solar power need to be complemented by reliable alternatives, particularly amid extreme weather events.\nSocial transition risk\nAs noted above, around 60% of Australia’s electricity currently comes from coal-fired power stations, and many communities, particularly in regional areas, are reliant on the coal industry for employment. Coal remains one of Australia’s leading exports. ANZ believes that all stakeholders in the transition to lower emissions should give careful consideration to the impacts on affected communities. Power prices in Australia have increased significantly in recent years due to a range of factors. This has added to cost of living pressures faced by businesses and consumers. Employment opportunities have been created by the transition but some communities, particularly in regional areas reliant on the coal industry for employment, will suffer significant social and economic costs if the transition is not managed appropriately.\nIn seeking to support the shift to a low carbon economy, ANZ intends to do so in a manner that supports new economic opportunities and helps people and communities thrive. We are keen to ensure that the risk of any sudden shocks are minimised and that communities are not “left behind”.\nThis is one of the reasons ANZ is seeking long term, publicly available transition plans from our major emitting customers. This will help communities and governments anticipate and adjust to change over time. ANZ expects its customers with large coal-fired power plants to provide at least three years’ advance notice of closures and engage with all their stakeholders to minimise the impact on their workers, local communities and downstream energy users.\n15\nOur commitments\nTherefore, ANZ supports and commits to its continued involvement in customer, community and government efforts to help ensure an orderly and just transition. To facilitate this ANZ has committed to:\n\nfunding and facilitating at least $15 billion by 2020 towards environmentally sustainable solutions for our customers, including initiatives that help lower carbon emissions, e.g. increased energy efficiency in industry, low emissions transport, green buildings, reforestation, renewable energy and battery storage, emerging technologies (such as carbon capture and storage) and climate change adaptation measures. This target has been met early in 2019 with over $19 billion achieved to date, and we are in the process of setting a new target for 2020 and beyond;\nencouraging and supporting 100 of our largest emitting\ncustomers in the energy, transport, buildings and food, beverage and agricultural sectors to establish or where appropriate, strengthen existing low carbon transition plans by 2021. Work has already begun with engagement with 29 customers this year and desktop research has been completed on a further 55 customers. ANZ will also encourage customers that have coal-fired generation assets to work towards setting medium and long-term emission reduction targets up to 2050 that contribute towards achieving a ‘less than 2˚C target’;\nIn 2020/21 we will seek to enhance our response to climate-related risks and opportunities through measures such as:\nstress testing of selected portfolios. For example, we have\ncompleted an analysis of flood-related risks for our home loan portfolio in a major regional location of Australia and a test-pilot of socio-economic indicators showing financial resilience of home loan customers with respect to flood risk. We will consider extending that scenario analysis to incorporate bushfire, flood and other risks relating to retail customers;\n\nincluding climate risk in agriculture-related lending guidance documents used by our front line bankers;\ncontinuing to encourage customers to develop and disclose their transition plans in key sectors - energy, transport, buildings and agribusiness, and considering how to integrate that work into customer and portfolio assessments;\nreplacing our current target of $15 billion being directed towards environmentally sustainable solutions by 2020, with a new goal to 2025; and\nachieving our target to procure 100% renewable energy for our\noperations by 2025.\nHow we are placed\nreduce exposure to thermal coal, including by only lending to\nnew customers where their thermal coal operations are less than half their revenue, installed capacity or generation. Our thermal coal mining exposures have halved since 2015 and will continue to reduce;\nYour Board does not believe that ANZ is being left behind, nor does it believe that ANZ is unnecessarily exposing itself or shareholders to transitional climate risk.\nYour Board considers ANZ’s approach of supporting an orderly and just transition is in the best interests of the Company as a whole.\nproviding incentives for customers to reduce emissions, such as facilitating, in partnership with government, concessional loans for corporate and agribusiness customers to buy energy-efficient equipment. In 2019, ANZ announced an additional $100 million commitment to the ANZ/CEFC Energy Efficient Asset Finance Program, taking our total commitment to $250 million since December 2017;\nonly considering financing the construction of new large-scale office buildings which achieve or exceed a NABERS1 4.5 star standard (or equivalent international rating) ‘as designed’;\nonly considering financing new coal-fired power plants if they use advanced technologies and higher quality thermal coal to significantly reduce emissions to 0.8 tC02/MWh or less. ANZ will not finance any new build of conventional2 coal fired power plants; and\ncontinuing to implement strengthened due diligence processes which govern our lending to thermal coal mining, transportation and power generation.\nBased on the above and with specific regard to what this resolution is asking for, ANZ believes that:\n\nit already makes significant disclosures regarding its strategies to reduce exposure to coal; and\nat this point in time, it is not appropriate to put in place a binding\ncommitment to reduce gas and oil exposure owing to the fact that gas in particular will play a critical role in the transition to a low carbon economy. Rather, each opportunity will be evaluated and considered on its individual merits. As the facts and circumstances change, so too will ANZ’s approach and commitments. Our reporting on our fossil fuel exposure will continue and be expanded over time.\nBoard recommendation: Having regard to the matters set out above, the Board does not consider the proposed resolution to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Therefore, the Board recommends that shareholders eligible to do so vote against item 7.\n1. NABERS (National Australian Built Environment Rating System) is a rating system measuring the environmental performance of Australian buildings, tenancies and homes, e.g. energy efficiency, water usage, waste management and indoor environment quality.\n2. “Conventional” plants are those plants not utilising advanced, commercially proven technologies (such as supercritical or ultra-supercritical boilers, gasification or circulating\nfluidised boilers) to significantly reduce CO2 emissions.\n16\nITEM 8 RESOLUTION REQUISITIONED BY MEMBERS – ORDINARY RESOLUTION ON LOBBYING INCONSISTENT WITH THE GOALS OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT (CONDITIONAL , NON-BOARD ENDORSED ITEM)\nA group of shareholders has proposed the resolution in item 8 in this Notice of Meeting. The resolution is an advisory resolution. The resolution is not endorsed by the Board.\nThe resolution in item 8 will be proposed to the Meeting only if the resolution in item 6 is passed by the requisite majority.\nReasons why the Board recommends that shareholders vote against item 8 if it is put to the Meeting\nANZ is a member of a number of industry associations. In 2019 key memberships relevant to the subject matter of this resolution included:\nAustralian Banking Association\nBusiness Council of Australia\nCarbon Markets Institute\nClean Energy Council\nEnergy Efficient Council\nWe work in a collaborative and open way as members of associations that have similar interests and approaches to ours.\nYour Board understands that ANZ’s stakeholders are interested in the position ANZ takes on issues such as data security, privacy and climate change, and our membership of industry associations that develop policies and undertake advocacy on these issues.\nSome associations have broad memberships, such as the Business Council of Australia, and develop policy agendas on a wide variety of issues, such as tax, education, business regulation, climate change and energy. ANZ believes that industry associations have the capacity to play a key role in advancing the development of standards, best practices and constructive policy that are of benefit to members, the economy and society. Membership provides ANZ with the ability to lead, influence and strengthen public policy in relation to various issues. The broader benefits that industry associations can provide need to be borne in mind.\nYour Board understands it is not possible for industry associations to obtain a consensus on every issue. There is sometimes disagreement amongst members about the final positions taken by industry associations. We place high importance on the ability to hold constructive dialogue within an association’s membership and we expect industry associations to be receptive to member feedback regarding their lobbying or advocacy approaches.\nIt is also important to note that industry associations do not represent the views of any single member. On some issues ANZ will communicate its views directly, through submissions, media comment, speeches by senior executives at industry forums and public reports. From time to time, we may take positions on certain matters not supported by the relevant industry association. For example, ANZ was the first major bank to support a “last resort” compensation scheme for victims of misconduct. Such a scheme is now public policy.\nANZ’s position on climate change seeks to support the shift to a low carbon economy and, as explained above (see item 7), ANZ intends to do so in a way that helps provide new economic opportunities and helps people and communities thrive - to help ensure an orderly and just transition. Your Board believes that, in many ways, ANZ’s commitments are more ambitious than those of some of the industry associations of which ANZ is a member. Over time, however, ANZ will advocate its position within these associations with the objective of achieving greater alignment.\nBoard Recommendation: Having regard to the matters set out above, the Board does not consider the proposed resolution to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Therefore, the Board recommends that shareholders vote against item 8.\nAPPENDIX – SUPPORTING STATEMENTS PROVIDED BY MARKET FORCES AND THE AUSTRALASIAN CENTRE FOR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY (ACCR)\nThe statements which follow for items 6 and 7 were provided by Market Forces. The statement which follows for item 8 was provided by ACCR. These statements are not endorsed by the Board. The Board recommends that shareholders vote against item 6 and, if put to the Meeting, items 7 and 8.\nITEM 6 AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\nShareholder resolutions are a healthy part of corporate democracy in many jurisdictions other than Australia. For example, in the UK shareholders can consider resolutions seeking to explicitly direct the conduct of the board. In the US, New Zealand and Canada shareholders can consider resolutions seeking to advise their board as to how it should act. As a matter of practice, typically, unless the board permits it, Australian shareholders cannot follow the example of their UK, US, New Zealand or Canadian cousins in this respect.\nA board of Directors is a steward for shareholders and accountability for the discharge of that stewardship is essential to long-term corporate prosperity.\nIn rare situations the appropriate course of action for shareholders dissatisfied with the conduct of board members is to seek to remove them. But in many situations such a personality-focused approach is unproductive and unwarranted. In those situations a better course of action is to formally and publicly allow shareholders the opportunity at shareholder meetings such as the AGM to alert board members that the shareholders seek more information or favour a particular approach to corporate policy.\nThe Constitution of ANZ is not conducive to the right of shareholders to place resolutions on the agenda of a shareholder meeting.\nIn our view, this is contrary to the long-term interests of ANZ, the ANZ board and all ANZ shareholders.\nPassage of this resolution - to amend the ANZ constitution - will simply put the company in a similar position in regard to shareholder resolutions as any listed company in the UK, US, Canada or New Zealand.\nWe encourage shareholders to vote in favour of this resolution.\n17\nITEM 7 TRANSITION PLANNING DISCLOSURE\nDespite committing to support the climate goals of the Paris Agreement, ANZ has failed to align its lending practices or policies with these goals.\nANZ must disclose strategies and targets to reduce exposure to fossil fuels in line with the climate goals of the Paris Agreement, or risk exposing itself and shareholders to needless transitional climate risk.\nANZ’s current activities Despite the rapid declines in fossil fuel use required for a Paris- aligned transition, our company’s loan book fails to reflect this trend. ANZ has repeatedly stated it expects its coal exposure to decline moving forward.7, 8 However, our company’s reported exposure at default (EAD) to coal mining increased by 27% from $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion over FY17-18 and a further 7% to $1.5 billion over FY18- 1H19. ANZ’s reported EAD to oil and gas has increased each year since FY16; from $17.7 billion in FY16, to $18 billion in FY17, to $18.4 billion in FY18.9\nANZ being left behind Signed by 197 nations, the Paris Agreement aims to limit “the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C.”1\nMajor financial institutions have called for action to reduce emissions in line with the Paris climate goals, including the phase out of coal power in OECD countries by 2030. Signed by 515 investors representing over US$35 trillion in assets, the Global Investor Statement to Governments on Climate Change requests governments “phase out thermal coal power worldwide by set deadlines.”2 Its accompanying Briefing Paper clarifies these deadlines, including the elimination of coal power in OECD countries by no later than 2030.3\nCommonwealth Bank has committed to “reduce our exposures to thermal coal mining and coal fired power generation, with the view to exiting the sector by 2030.”4 Similarly, QBE will no longer insure new thermal coal projects, and will phase out all direct insurance services to thermal coal customers by 2030.5\nA Paris-aligned energy transition also requires significant declines in oil and gas use. The IPCC’s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C demonstrates that the role of gas for primary energy must decline globally by 25% by 2030 (from a 2010 baseline), with oil’s role in primary energy falling 37% over the same time frame.6\nANZ also continues to finance the expansion of the fossil fuel industry. In July 2018, ANZ loaned $150 million to Senex Energy “to fund expansionary capital expenditure across its Surat Basin and Cooper Basin oil and gas acreage.”10 In December 2017, ANZ provided a loan for the development of a new gas field in Sumatra, Indonesia. The estimated lifetime C02 emissions of this gas field are 295 million tonnes,11 equivalent to 55% of Australia’s annual emissions.12\nANZ also lends against the balance sheets of companies such as Whitehaven Coal and Woodside Petroleum, whose plans to significantly increase fossil fuel production are entirely inconsistent with the Paris climate goals. Whitehaven justifies its expansion plans with energy demand projections that are consistent with 3°C of warming by 2100,13 while Woodside’s capital expenditure plans have been found to be incompatible with a Paris-aligned warming outcome.14\nFinancial risks and regulatory scrutiny In June 2017, the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) published its final recommendations, designed to allow investors to “appropriately assess and price climate-related risk and opportunities.”15\nRecognising “Banks are exposed to climate-related risks and opportunities through their lending and other financial intermediary activities as well as through their own operations,” the TCFD recommends:\nBanks should provide the metrics used to assess the impact of (transition and physical) climate-related risks on their lending and other financial intermediary business activities in the short, medium, and long term.16\nThe TCFD also states: “Organizations should describe their key climate-related targets ... in line with anticipated regulatory requirements or market constraints or other goals.”\n1. https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/english_paris_agreement.pdf, art 2(1)(a) 2. https://theinvestoragenda.org/focus-areas/policy-advocacy/ 3. https://theinvestoragenda.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GISGCC-briefing-paper-FlNAL.pdf 4. https://www.commbank.com.au/content/dam/commbank/about-us/download-printed-forms/environment-and-social-framework.pdf 5. http://qbe.com/media-centre/qbe-group-energy-policy 6. https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/ 7. https://www.marketforces.org.au/anz-doesnt-intend-for-coal-lending-to-increase 8. https://www.marketforces.org.au/anz-not-living-up-to-its-commitments 9. https://www.anz.com/content/dam/anzcom/shareholder/anzfy18_results_presentation_and_idp_final_ website.pdf (slide 136) 10. https://www.senexenergy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018.10.29-Financial-Close-of-Debt-Facility.pdf 11. https://www.marketforces.org.au/campaigns/banks-new/twodegrees/ 12. https://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/climate-science-data/greenhouse-gas-measurement/publications/quarterly-update-australias-nggi-mar-2019 13. http://www.whitehavencoal.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/WVN_224754_AnnuaI-Report-2018_LR_FA-3.pdf 14. https://www.carbontracker.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CTI_Breaking_the_Habit_Report_6.pdf 15. https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FINAL-TCFD-Report-062817.pdf 16. https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FINAL-TCFD-Annex-062817.pdf\n18\nANZ welcomed the TCFD recommendations in 2017.17 However, after two years, shareholders have been provided with only superficial information. Our company has disclosed no quantitative evaluation of its loan book exposure to climate change transition risks, nor any targets to demonstrate management of these risks.18 ANZ is falling behind competitors like Commonwealth Bank, which has been disclosing measurable risks for two reporting cycles.\nAdoption of this resolution would ensure ANZ discloses metrics and targets to demonstrate effective management of financial climate change transition risks, in line with the TCFD recommendations and previously stated investor expectations.\nAustralian regulators have been calling for robust climate risk management from financial institutions. APRA has warned “Some climate risks are distinctly ‘financial’ in nature. Many of these risks are foreseeable, material and actionable now.”19 APRA Executive Board Member Geoff Summerhayes has since said: “APRA wants to see continuous improvement in how organisations disclose and manage these [climate] risks over coming years.”20\nITEM 8 ORDINARY RESOLUTION ON LOBBYING INCONSISTENT WITH THE GOALS OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT\nThe Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) supports our company’s commitment to the goals of the Paris Agreement (Paris Goals). However, meeting the Paris Goals requires public policy support. Lobbying by industry associations against public policy designed to meet the Paris Goals is therefore of increasing concern to investors worldwide.23 The activities of our company’s industry associations in Australia, a key jurisdiction for our company, conflict with the prospect of policy supportive the Paris Goals being implemented, counter to our company’s stated policies and long- term financial and strategic interests.\nACCR acknowledges the commitments our company has made to reduce its own emissions and those of its customers, including but not limited to:\n– Source 100% renewable electricity by 202524;\nASIC in September 2018 stated: “Climate change is a foreseeable risk facing many listed companies ... Directors and officers of listed companies need to understand and continually reassess existing and emerging risks (including climate risk) that may affect the company’s business. This extends to both short-term and long-term risks.”21\n– Fund and facilitate at least $15 billion by 2020 towards\nenvironmentally sustainable solutions for our customers25;\n– Support 100 of our largest emitting customers to strengthen\nexisting low carbon transition plans, by 202126.\nIt has also been found that the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (which ANZ is subject to) require banks to formulate concrete climate goals for their financial services.22\nHowever, our company is a member of one of the most influential industry associations opposing effective climate policy in Australia, the Business Council of Australia (BCA).\nInvestor support required Despite its stated support for the Paris Agreement, ANZ remains an active investor in an expanding fossil fuel sector, further exposing shareholders to financial risks associated with the economic transition required to meet the Paris climate goals.\nDespite cosmetic support for the Paris Agreement, in the last three years, the BCA has:\n– called for new investment in existing coal-fired power stations27;\n– supported the use of Kyoto carryover credits which will weaken Australia’s 2030 emissions reduction target from 26-28% (by 2030) to approximately 15%28;\nWe urge shareholders to vote in favour of this resolution, and expect the many institutional investors already outspoken on this issue to offer their support.\n– during the 2019 Federal election, claimed that the ALP’s 45% emissions reduction target would inhibit economic growth29;\n– stated that more ambitious emissions reduction targets would\nlead to “deindustrialisation”30;\n17. https://www.anz.com.au/about-us/sustainability-framework/environmental-sustainability/climate-change/ 18. https://www.anz.com/content/dam/anzcom/shareholder/anz_2018_annual_review_final.pdf 19. https://www.apra.gov.au/media-centre/speeches/australias-new-horizon-climate-change-challenges-and-prudential-risk 20. https://www.apra.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/apra-step-scrutiny-climate-risks-after-releasing-survey-results 21. https://download.asic.gov.au/media/4871341/rep593-published-20-september-2018.pdf 22. https://www.oecdguidelines.nl/documents/publication/2019/04/19/ncp-final-statement-4-ngos-vs-ing 23.

However, the BCA’s long record of climate policy obstructionism dwarfs our company’s efforts to reduce its own carbon footprint and those of its customers. Support for the use of Kyoto carryover credits, for example, equates to a 370 million tonne discount on Australia’s 2030 target42. This is far greater than any reduction in emissions that our company could ever hope to deliver.\n– argued for exemptions from climate policy for EITE industries35;\n– argued against any extension of the Renewable Energy Target\n(RET) and stated that “there was no role for state-based” renewable energy targets36;\n– called for the removal of state-based moratoria on gas\nOur company has said that it will retain membership of an industry association provided it is “able to have a constructive dialogue within the association, and they are receptive to members’ feedback”43. Given the BCA’s long record of advocacy opposing climate action, it is clear that our company’s attempts to exert its influence “inside the tent” have proven ineffective to date.\ndevelopment37;\nDespite its claim that it supports a “market-based price signal” on carbon emissions38, the BCA campaigned against Australia’s price on carbon in 2012–1439. In September 2019, BCA CEO Jennifer Westacott claimed that an appropriate price for carbon emissions would be A$10 per tonne40, despite the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggesting Australia would require a carbon price of US$75 per tonne in order to meet the Paris Goals41.\nIt is no longer tolerable for our company to spend shareholder funds supporting industry associations that delay the implementation of policies necessary to achieve the Paris Goals.\nACCR urges shareholders to vote for this proposal.\nIn September 2019, the BCA received a ‘Carbon Policy Footprint’ score of -30 from UK-based research group InfluenceMap (on a scale of -100 to +100), ranking it within the 30 most obstructive industry associations in the world on climate policy.\n31. https://twitter.com/BCAcomau/status/1011414577702031361 32. https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/26/turnbull-quashes-abbotts-bid-to-give-party-room-a-say-on-energy-guarantee 33.

    "content": "News Release\nFor Release: 27 November 2019\nANZ update on actions to prevent financial crime\nFollowing shareholder queries, ANZ today provided an update on the actions it has taken to assist in the prevention of financial crime in the Australian banking system. ANZ also confirmed it is not aware of any impending litigation from AUSTRAC.\nANZ Chief Risk Officer Kevin Corbally said: “Protecting the Australian banking system from criminal use is one of our most important roles and one all of our people are trained in and take incredibly seriously.\n“ANZ has been working with AUSTRAC, law enforcement and the broader industry to detect, prevent and disrupt serious financial crimes. This includes money laundering, terrorism, human trafficking, tax evasion and child exploitation.\n“Given recent issues identified by AUSTRAC within the industry, we have been reviewing the systems and processes we use to transfer money to ensure we are reporting the information required by regulators. While the review is ongoing, it has found no material issues to date,” Mr Corbally said.\nIn March 2017, ANZ joined the Fintel Alliance, a public-private partnership led by AUSTRAC to combat serious financial crime, including child exploitation.\nFor media enquiries contact:\nStephen Ries, +61 409 655 551\nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited ABN 11 005 357 522"
