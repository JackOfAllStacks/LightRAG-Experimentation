Its essential role encompasses ensuring the financial stability and integrity of the financial system by establishing and enforcing standards related to capital requirements, risk management, and regulatory compliance.\n\nAPRA\u0027s oversight includes monitoring the compliance of institutions such as ANZ (Australia and New Zealand Banking Group) with the capital requirements outlined in the Banking Act 1959. In this capacity, APRA has authorized ANZ to employ advanced measurement approaches for calculating operational risk capital requirements, as well as overseeing the bank\u2019s regulatory capital calculations based on risk-based capital assessment frameworks. Furthermore, APRA requires banks, including ANZ, to hold additional risk-based capital to cover the potential risks associated with credit valuation adjustment losses.\n\nThe authority also plays a significant role in approving ANZ\u0027s internal models for calculating regulatory capital and overseeing its operations and risk management frameworks. Specifically, APRA has regulatory authority over ANZ\u0027s corporate probabilistic default (PD) master scale and has established frameworks for the bank\u0027s securitisation transactions. Additionally, APRA requires prior approval for ANZ\u0027s payment of dividends on ordinary shares, thereby influencing reporting related to capital adequacy.\n\nBeyond regulatory oversight, APRA engages in consultations regarding investment practices within institutional subsidiaries and has instituted self-assessments from ANZ and other financial services in light of findings from the Royal Commission, which underscores its commitment to enhancing regulatory oversight and resilience within Australia\u2019s financial sector.\n\nIn summary, APRA is dedicated to safeguarding the interests of depositors by ensuring the solvency and compliance of financial institutions, playing a vital role in the stability of the financial framework in Australia, particularly in relation to significant banks like ANZ.", "entity_type": "\"ORGANIZATION\"", "id": "\"APRA\"", "label": "\"APRA\"", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "source_id": "chunk-1fdbae773078167346c03d5abb070597\u003cSEP\u003echunk-8804b937b46f27dc79fb357a6fe47d49\u003cSEP\u003echunk-ced294584d07e87338ecd17c92a6c601\u003cSEP\u003echunk-c0b412eb42cd42808e56a873b81e9c25\u003cSEP\u003echunk-948329c3cf72de850043c1e362d0bbe7\u003cSEP\u003echunk-255778f72be8eafbe6647ba2218c74c1\u003cSEP\u003echunk-2da6b0c19ab34f6dbf4693cefdaa8822\u003cSEP\u003echunk-d3b7f9ed878595236d24eeed4674a7d0\u003cSEP\u003echunk-73866806b8ce234efd3439b5b7bba01c\u003cSEP\u003echunk-b2eb5aa63b6ccbd2854c9b9f10527224\u003cSEP\u003echunk-ddf62c448d5ccdb1a8789a746d2ed581\u003cSEP\u003echunk-493697a4372d31e70b2d17e2ac33676b\u003cSEP\u003echunk-aaa000010f89f2776d94aec21d460228\u003cSEP\u003echunk-c44eae7c5afcfe12700d3767787cb83c\u003cSEP\u003echunk-5eb3392e4ad8cef9f30fefffdb1a39bc\u003cSEP\u003echunk-d43d75a8acc03a2f2367fb07b3780131\u003cSEP\u003echunk-810ee30482df9df2630501e296657806\u003cSEP\u003echunk-27141ba1e8c6e6ac0c3b97eb32cfd496\u003cSEP\u003echunk-3c18bae916bc7191a3a0a399958f84a4\u003cSEP\u003echunk-6938c43579a43b73e0b351610d9fc17d\u003cSEP\u003echunk-bf7e0bdce59fd2866cccf8383c02ea3d\u003cSEP\u003echunk-d155be184437929363e8eb61106195a8\u003cSEP\u003echunk-9fab40cbfffffbfc582d6109cab07029\u003cSEP\u003echunk-bb987e1617df5e8493a42ab9fccd11b8\u003cSEP\u003echunk-14607859fbefc67d29953d0ef688743c\u003cSEP\u003echunk-ffbe2800e106f03f55ea93877f126b3d\u003cSEP\u003echunk-14cf86bf378c298fff5cfbd45edcd32d\u003cSEP\u003echunk-b0e363add93d6eeb5966cae1e16962a0\u003cSEP\u003echunk-4929537417363afda456a27c2ce6c953\u003cSEP\u003echunk-6b40fe7f2c6e780a3c546aa3ff972ae1\u003cSEP\u003echunk-f7087eda9b00cadb932affa0dd90faa5\u003cSEP\u003echunk-83818db05c2365907929db93d9782578\u003cSEP\u003echunk-4b2c3bb870246c3042aa77be07653c01\u003cSEP\u003echunk-2b49e15ae43d28f88abc70a43c8c0096\u003cSEP\u003echunk-779c1f36217957b6d13d95071704915a\u003cSEP\u003echunk-73b4a3f7a612eb04a569e2e2ba6d3d92\u003cSEP\u003echunk-01baf8e5e1b7d249ffa53eebb5f8263d\u003cSEP\u003echunk-dd9d5f1446ffadafbb7dfdfae8231c4a\u003cSEP\u003echunk-1c58fec79388b9f222641fa3083f67d9\u003cSEP\u003echunk-a7adc4e454ee804b5b0c8d25905d99c4\u003cSEP\u003echunk-6e279adfa3c8cb4a293af2c7a99c723d\u003cSEP\u003echunk-cb616533ce8e786472ecb759f69558dd\u003cSEP\u003echunk-49246825cc4996c7c1d84b2abba62dfc\u003cSEP\u003echunk-383666bcf00042301526fa367947e46f\u003cSEP\u003echunk-09e65e14e2e468301a7ad3c519d3d49f\u003cSEP\u003echunk-a958b08bed82cb09cb455c2d834317a3\u003cSEP\u003echunk-d5359d1edd815ed127080d45bfe386ee\u003cSEP\u003echunk-55f0b0e7c97985ce42fc43126575dc1d\u003cSEP\u003echunk-6476734b6505439f2b27f36bef90b3e7\u003cSEP\u003echunk-b01ba4812a0b91ab86ee888752bf9783\u003cSEP\u003echunk-e7fbd198b36417a92fb495c5c79e71ea\u003cSEP\u003echunk-4ef636408aba02feee3aeb9fa1a08a90\u003cSEP\u003echunk-70e6786c1a0f84cdefa8970c907896b3\u003cSEP\u003echunk-ec0bbe9694653b276e6c0d1c33c7e87a\u003cSEP\u003echunk-eebd3adcaa2be8b912d967cd104311c5\u003cSEP\u003echunk-6e08d79dc2f0dd63fa63a28e22e1b61c\u003cSEP\u003echunk-a9d29f792df09e3cffac7b395586c0ec"}, {"color": "#dbd0f6", "description": "\"ANZ is a banking and financial services company with various operations in Australia and New Zealand, located in Docklands Vic.\"\u003cSEP\u003e\"ANZ is a financial institution involved in various shareholding and custodial activities, highlighting its role in wealth management.\"\u003cSEP\u003eANZ, or Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, is a major financial institution based in Australia and New Zealand, serving approximately eight million customers across 33 markets. As a prominent player in the banking sector, ANZ offers a diverse range of financial services, including retail banking, commercial banking, institutional services, and investment services. The organization is involved in crucial operations such as shareholder meetings, performance rights allocation, and dividend distributions, recently announcing its 2019 Final Dividend along with details pertaining to its Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) and Bonus +Security Plan (BSP).\n\nANZ conducts an Annual General Meeting (AGM) to engage with corporate shareholders, where significant operational matters are discussed, including performance, strategic directions, executive remuneration, and corporate governance. The board of ANZ is tasked with overseeing the Chief Executive Officer\u0027s performance rights, ensuring adherence to best practices in corporate governance.\n\nSustainability and corporate social responsibility are key components of ANZ\u0027s strategic initiatives. The organization is committed to achieving a net-zero carbon economy and publicly supports the Paris Agreement, despite facing scrutiny for its ongoing investments in fossil fuels and lending activities linked to fossil fuel projects. Critics argue that these actions contradict its sustainability commitments. Nevertheless, ANZ has proactively implemented measures to manage climate-related risks and enhance carbon reporting. It was also the first Australian bank to report under the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nIn addition to its environmental goals, ANZ emphasizes the importance of diversity and inclusion, particularly in leadership roles, and is committed to fostering an ethical workplace culture. With a workforce of around 39,060 employees, the bank aims to enhance customer engagement through innovative digital solutions, including advanced security features like voice ID technology.\n\nThe organization\u0027s commitment to neutrality regarding its Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) for the 2019 Final Dividend reflects its dedication to balancing shareholder interests with its operational and sustainability objectives.

southwestern Pacific Ocean, renowned for its diverse landscapes and rich indigenous M\u0101ori culture. Within the context of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), New Zealand serves as a pivotal region for various financial operations, particularly as an address for shareholders and a jurisdiction where corporate governance allows shareholders to make resolutions to influence board conduct.\n\nANZ operates extensively in New Zealand, offering a wide range of banking services that include retail and commercial banking, home loans, and sustainable finance initiatives. The bank emphasizes community engagement and environmental sustainability through various housing initiatives, such as the Healthy Home Loan Package, aimed at improving housing availability and energy efficiency. Additionally, ANZ promotes financial literacy through programs like MoneyMinded and encourages employee involvement in charitable trusts and community initiatives.\n\nThe economic landscape of New Zealand significantly impacts ANZ\u0027s financial activities and credit risk, characterized by population growth and commodity price stability. Regulatory scrutiny and specific capital requirements pose challenges for the bank, influencing its strategic decisions. Taxation matters, particularly relating to imputation credits for New Zealand resident shareholders on Australian dividends, are key considerations in ANZ\u0027s financial strategies.\n\nNew Zealand\u0027s agricultural sector, especially dairy farming, plays a crucial role in ANZ\u0027s operational and financial performance, contributing to vital metrics such as net interest income and customer deposits. The bank\u0027s operations are governed by local regulations and compliance mandates from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ), which are essential for maintaining economic stability. Discussions about sovereign risks associated with New Zealand also highlight potential implications for global financial stability.\n\nMoreover, New Zealand\u0027s significance is underscored in the context of shareholder interactions, as it is mentioned as a region where shareholders can lodge proxy forms and access specific contact information. Additionally, the monitoring of electricity generation assets and financed emissions reflects New Zealand\u0027s role in ANZ\u0027s broader risk management framework.

As a pivotal geographic area for ANZ, Australia is involved in considerable financial operations and serves as the location where various financial activities and transactions occur.\n\nThe country is currently engaged in important debates related to climate change and emissions reduction, as it undergoes a transition towards lower carbon energy sources, moving away from coal in favor of renewable energy solutions. This shift addresses not only environmental concerns but also the social impacts on communities dependent on the coal industry. In line with this, Australia emphasizes its commitment to cleaner energy initiatives and renewable generation projects, which reflects a broader environmental focus that aligns with ANZ\u0027s sustainability-oriented goals, including sustainability-linked loans and green finance endeavors.\n\nAustralia\u0027s economic landscape is characterized by significant financial metrics, such as unemployment rates and GDP growth, which directly influence ANZ\u0027s lending and underwriting strategies. The banking environment faces challenges such as low-interest rates, intense competition, and increased compliance costs, exacerbated by scrutiny from the Royal Commission into the banking sector. In response to these challenges, ANZ is working to enhance its customer service metrics.\n\nAdditionally, Australia is outlined as a vital trading partner for various countries, where global trade developments and political landscapes affect its economic conditions, and pose sovereign risks that can impact financial operations and credit exposures.

accounting for financial instruments, including aspects of credit losses.\"\u003cSEP\u003eAASB 9 is a significant accounting standard adopted by the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ) on October 1, 2018. This standard fundamentally revises the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities, replacing the previous standard, AASB 139. The implementation of AASB 9 has led to crucial changes in financial reporting practices, particularly concerning the recognition of expected credit losses (ECLs) and the management of credit risk.\n\nOne of the key features of AASB 9 is its forward-looking approach to measuring ECLs, which reflects a range of future economic conditions rather than relying solely on historical data. This shift necessitates organizations to adapt from an incurred loss model to one that proactively accounts for expected losses. As a result, ANZ and similar institutions have had to update their accounting policies to appropriately classify and measure financial instruments, impacting how they report credit risk information.\n\nFurthermore, AASB 9 introduced new hedge accounting requirements, which enhance the alignment between an organization\u2019s risk management strategies and the financial accounting associated with those strategies. This flexibility allows the Group to continue complying with previous guidelines until new projects are completed.\n\nOverall, AASB 9 represents a significant evolution in accounting standards, aimed at improving the transparency and accuracy of financial reporting, thereby affecting various aspects of financial instruments and credit loss management.

Established to investigate issues related to misconduct, governance, culture, and accountability within financial institutions, the Royal Commission\u0027s findings and recommendations have led to extensive scrutiny of the ethical standards within the banking sector and significant changes at ANZ.\n\nAs a direct consequence of the Royal Commission, ANZ has initiated several actions to align with heightened expectations surrounding corporate governance and ethics. The inquiry prompted the bank to revise its accountability frameworks, update remuneration policies, and enhance its risk management approaches. It also initiated 16 key reform initiatives aimed at addressing operational issues, improving customer support, and refining financial practices. These changes are a response to the need for accountability and increased transparency, particularly in light of identified failures and misconduct within Australian banks.\n\nFurthermore, the Royal Commission has affected ANZ financially by incurring legal costs and requiring the bank to adapt its business practices to comply with new regulatory reforms. The inquiry underscored the significance of customer treatment and initiated customer compensation programs to rebuild trust and enhance the overall customer experience. The repercussions of the Royal Commission\u0027s findings continue to shape ANZ\u0027s operational protocols as the institution endeavors to restore community trust in its services amid ongoing accountability challenges.

{"color": "#246061", "description": "AASB 15 is an accounting standard established by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that governs revenue recognition from contracts with customers. The standard was adopted by the group on 1 October 2018, resulting in significant changes to revenue recognition policies impacting their financial reporting. AASB 15 dictates that revenue recognition is based on distinct performance obligations within contracts and requires the allocation of transaction prices among those obligations.\n\nThe implementation of AASB 15 has led to a variety of changes in financial statements, including reclassification adjustments that affect various balance sheet items and alterations in the presentation of operating income and expenses. As a result, certain items now need to be reported differently, which influences how ANZ recognizes revenue from contracts with customers and the overall financial reporting practices within the organization.\n\nAASB 15 not only impacts the reporting of financial figures but also plays a crucial role in the transition processes reflected in the company\u2019s equity statements. The standard\u2019s requirements necessitate a thorough understanding and application in order to ensure accurate financial statement presentations, thereby influencing the reporting periods following its adoption. Overall, AASB 15 has significantly shaped the financial reporting framework of the organization.", "entity_type": "\"EVENT\"", "id": "\"AASB 15\"", "label": "\"AASB 15\"", "shape": "dot", "size": 10,

These assets are crucial for ANZ\u2019s balance sheet and financial operations, and they are categorized according to various measurement criteria as per accounting standards like AASB 9 and AASB 2017-6. This categorization is significant for assessing how assets are managed and reported. Financial Assets also include different classifications of loans and securities that contribute to the Group\u2019s net worth.\n\nMoreover, these assets can generate future cash flows, which are subject to evaluations for credit impairment based on established accounting standards. Financial Assets are important not only for their inherent value but also for their role in the Group\u0027s financial health, allowing ANZ to settle liabilities or be sold if necessary.

This relationship mandates that ANZ adheres to numerous regulations that impact its risk management practices, capital adequacy, and overall financial stability. APRA is directly involved in overseeing ANZ\u0027s compliance with the Banking Act 1959, ensuring that the bank maintains appropriate capital and liquidity ratios as a domestic systemically important bank.\n\nAPRA plays a crucial role in the regulatory interactions with ANZ, requiring the bank to seek approval for various actions, including transactions like the OnePath P\u0026I deal and limitations on dividend payments on ordinary shares. This regulatory oversight extends to ANZ\u0027s capital management strategies and practices, demanding compliance with specific capital requirements, risk management standards, and financial reporting obligations. \n\nThe bank must also adhere to APRA\u0027s regulations concerning counterparty credit risk management, securitisation transactions, and advanced measurement approaches for calculating operational risk capital requirements. Additionally, ANZ submits Self-Assessment Reports to APRA, particularly in the wake of the findings from the Royal Commission, indicating ongoing regulatory engagement.\n\nIn its day-to-day operations, ANZ complies with guidelines set forth by APRA, including adherence to standards such as AASB 9 and the Basel III framework, enabling sound risk assessment and management practices. APRA\u0027s oversight ensures that ANZ operates within a framework designed to maintain financial stability and protect depositors, thereby reinforcing the bank\u0027s commitment to prudent financial practices while navigating the complexities of the banking sector.", "from": "\"APRA\"", "keywords": "\"regulation, capital management\"\u003cSEP\u003e\"regulation,
